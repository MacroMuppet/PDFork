The Paris Agreement does not provide the strategy, actions, instruments, \nor means to boost the transition processes in global North and South. The world’s \nrich countries and people continue to exert rights to pollute the atmosphere \nwith greenhouse gases. A spearhead climate policy can trigger fast elimination \nof energy-related carbon dioxide emissions, with full de-carbonization of the \nelectricity supply as priority. Atomic power and flow renewable power (wind, \nsolar, running water) are simply juxtaposed as the two major low-carbon sup -\nply options. In reality they are mutually exclusive in fully decarbonized power \ngeneration systems. They are hard to match technically while their major mutual \nimpact is that they undermine the economic case for each other. \n1 Aviel Verbruggen, University of Antwerp, Belgium, aviel.verbruggen@uantwerpen.be; \nYuliya Yurchenko, University of Greenwich, United Kingdom, y.yurchenko@greenwich.\nac.uk  \n© The Author(s) 2019\nof Nuclear Power , Energiepolitik und Klimaschutz.

(Eds.), The Technological and Economic Future \n78 Aviel Verbruggen, and Yuliya Yurchenko\n1 Introduction\nCOP21 was widely celebrated as a global achievement in tackling climate change \ncertainly is a milestone in climate talks but does not bear enough thrust to spearhead \nenough action of enough urgency. It carries many endemic problems of previous \ninternational climate change agreements i.e., ambiguity of wording, lack of binding \nobligations, room for interpretation, etc. Too many concessions were made to turn \nit into text that all parties were ready to sign (Verbruggen, 2015). It came at a sacri -\nfice of drafting the foundations of urgently needed frameworks for governing the \nglobal climate commons. The problem of differentiated responsibility for the current \nstate and contamination of those very commons is not addressed in a meaningful \nway. By putting a price on GHG emissions, environmental destruction is traded, \nnormalized and not addressed; inviting those who can afford i.e., rich countries \nwhose industrialization destroyed the planet in the first place, to continue polluting. \nA lot of energy intensive and contaminating production of industrialized coun -\ntries has been allowed to move to newly industrialized and industrializing ones who \nare not economically strong to control and mitigate polluting or make polluters \npay – something that too will not be solved without coordinated global action and \na binding framework. Fast elimination of energy-related CO2 emission is needed. \nTwo main low-carbon options are seen as a solution here: renewable power (solar, \nwater, wind) and atomic. In this chapter we start from a brief comment on the \nCOP21 Paris Agreement (section 2). In section 3 we focus on the question of rights \nto emit greenhouse gases and ‘the polluter pays principle’. Section 4 presents the \nheadlines of spearhead action in climate policy by fast elimination of energy-related \nCO2 emissions. It is followed by section 5 where we show that there are but few \nlow-carbon energy supply options, with nuclear and flow renewable energy supply as \nthe main contenders for providing electricity. Moreover, low-carbon is only one of \nenergy supply options, which too need to be assessed for their overall sustainability \nperformance as we discuss in section 6. Nuclear power fails on crucial sustainability \naspects and collides with the full expansion of flow renewable energy supply (wind, \nsolar, running water) since, as we show in Section 7, the two low-carbon contenders \nundermine economic profitability of the other. The Conclusion summarizes our \nmain arguments and recommendations.\nThe Collision of Atomic and Flow Renewable Power … 79\n792 Paris Agreement: winners and losers\nOn December 12, 2015, French minister L. Fabius forged the general approval of \nthe Paris Agreement after days and nights of tedious negotiations. Evaluations of \nthe agreement range from ‘historical success’ to ‘epic failure’. The 31 pages text of \nthe Paris Decision & Agreement is grey, vague, and silent about how UNFCCC will \ngovern the global climate commons. It holds boundless opportunities for differen -\ntiated interpretation. PwC director J. Grant talked of “ constructive ambiguity, or \neven woolly wording in some areas ”, and L. Fabius stated: “ this allows all countries \nthe ability to take the deal home and declare success”.  Ambiguity and woolly wording \nmeans that every party can read the text as their success and this speaks of a shaky \ncontract. Without mastering COP’s 24-year history and its jargon language, the \nParis text is difficult to understand. For satisfying all COP delegations, the text is \nstripped of content, leaving voluntary efforts, voluntary contributions, and vol -\nuntary transfers as fillings for patchwork of voluntary projects. It is not clear who \nundertakes which projects, how and with whom, as the final decisions are under \nthe discretion of “ all Parties and non-Party stakeholders, including civil society, the \nprivate sector, financial institutions, cities and other subnational authorities, local \ncommunities and indigenous peoples ”. Does an agreement, allowing willing people \nto set up voluntary initiatives, generate sufficient thrust for drastic and urgent \nchange? In our view it does not.\nThe unanimous adoption of the Paris text prompted praise, high expectations, \nand certainly relief for the club of veteran COP participants. The process was widely \napplauded by most media and societal groups: the many people and organizations \nconcerned about derailing climate change, involved scientists, active governments, \nsocial organizations, banks, industrial companies, up to corporates with significant \nactivities and assets related to fossil fuels and to atomic power. \nPopular enthusiasm over marginal accord in the light of previous COP failures \nobscures the danger of agreements where interests of participants are too diverging, \neven opposite, and not reconcilable in the practical realization of the agreement. \nOne tends to forget that the day-to-day economic priorities and limitation as well as \necological plans – or absence of such – in the participant countries will inevitably \nsour the optimism of the agreement. Industrialized countries’ actions and inten -\ntions since the COP21 ovation do not appear assuring of their changing course. \nAnd these are the parties who should be global leaders of positive change due to \ntheir economic capacity and because of their role in destroying the environment in \nthe first place. Instead, Norway, for example, plans exploitation of all its fossil fuel \nresources. The EU ETS permit prices per ton CO2 emitted hovered back to the €5 \nwaiting dock, after a ripple beyond €8 during 2015. France’s investment in renewable \n80 Aviel Verbruggen, and Yuliya Yurchenko\nenergy fell from €6.2 billion in 2014 to €2.9 billion in 2015. After post-Chernobyl \nstalling, atomic power was brought back in as a solution to the inability to effec -\ntively reduce CO2 emissions (Mez, Schneider, and Thomas 2009) and is still on the \ntable. The French nuclear conglomerates see the COP21 outcome as a window of \nopportunity for more atomic power projects. France is an important exporter of \natomic power production with the state’s heavy involvement in atomic producer \nownership – AREVA and EDF are some 90% and 85% state owned and are world \nleaders in atomic exports (World Nuclear Association 2016). It is then not surprising \nthat the French government promotes atomic energy as a “green option” at home \nand abroad (Ibid.). The option is, however, neither green, nor cheap in the short \nand long run alike as some £18 billion budgeted – with a very realistic prospect of \nadding £2.7 billion (EDF 2016) – Hinkley Point C project in the UK confirms (see \nalso Schneider, Froggatt, and Thomas (2011) on high costs of atomic power). What \nthe atomic option may do is pull urgently needed resources from being invested \ninto truly sustainable, green projects.\nCOP21 did not establish the elementary conditions and instruments for starting \nan effective UNFCCC governance of the global commons atmosphere and climate \n(Verbruggen, 2015). Overall, major industrial, financial, and political interests have \nswindled good-meaning activists, environmental NGOs, and developing countries. \nMass outsourcing of production to low-income countries and internationalization \nof production chains makes it harder to trace which country and whose companies \npollute while it is the governments and end consumers who are being made to pay. \nIPCC, among other, document that ‘a growing share of CO2 emissions from fossil \nfuel combustion in developing countries is released in the production of goods and \nservices exported, notably from upper-middle-income countries to high-income \ncountries’ (IPCC 2014)\nThe economic and political ideologies and interests that created the energy and \nclimate problems after World War II, continue to occupy the pole positions, now \ncontrolling the sort, price, and pace of the low-carbon energy transitions further \njeopardizing possibilities for a progressive change.\n3 Rights to CO2 pollution or applying ‘the Polluter Pays \nPrinciple’\nAddressing the annual 50Gt ton GHG emissions must be prioritised because climate \nchange causes or aggravates the other daunting global problems (UNDP 2007). \nGovernments and companies tend to convert the +2°C limit into a spendable carbon \nThe Collision of Atomic and Flow Renewable Power … 81\n81emissions budget, considered and handled as ‘ rights to emit’ . This practice rises the \nlikelihood of transgressing the +2°C limit to near certainty and is geared towards \nappropriation by present rich countries and by carbon-intensive lifestyles, and is \nuncritically propagated by mainstream economists and media as a message that \nreads: ‘ by mitigating emissions, present generations deliver efforts and make expenses \nfor the benefit of future generations ’. This unwarranted rights position conflicts with \na civilized status of environmental policy. Emitting CO2 in the atmosphere is an \nactivity of dumping without hindsight or ‘ gaseous littering’ . Industrialized socie -\nties acknowledge the ‘Polluter Pays Principle’ and polluters face two obligations: \npollution must immediately stop and polluters must bear responsibility for the \nmess caused. Due to the atmosphere being the global commons, it is difficult to \nimpose and enforce the actual implementation of the polluter pays principle. The \nway in which responsibilities are allocated in terms of ‘right to pollute’ and ‘price \nof pollution’ is ridden with problems. It is undisputable that ‘both international \nand national decision making must aim to take account of income and wealth \ndifferentials and regional disparities within as well as between nations’ (Newell \net al 2015: 239). However, there is also the issue of difficulty to trace who pollutes \nwhat in internationalized production chains where countries, not companies, are \nheld responsible for pollution that affects their geographic territory or the global \natmospheric commons, while the profits from production more often than not \nescape those countries’ controls.\n4 Spearheading climate policy by fast elimination of \nenergy-related CO2-emissions\nSince the UN Framework Convention (1992), over the Kyoto Protocol (1997) and \nthe Copenhagen Accord (2009), yearly global GHG emissions continued to grow, \nas did the annual use of commercial energy (IEA’s yearly Outlook). About 4/5th of \nGHG emissions are the result of present energy supply and use practices. In 2015 \nCO2 emissions growth stalled due to a global expansion of renewable energy supply. \nPresumably more than 4/5th of the climate policy studies focus on energy-related \nCO2 emissions and their mitigation. Climate policy goes beyond the issue of ener -\ngy (e.g., other GHG than fossil fuel related CO2, land-use, adaptation) but is also \ninfluenced by fossil fuels use (for example methane emissions, changing land-uses \naffected by low-priced supply of fossil fuels).\nOngoing climate policy is little effective partly because there are many goals on \nseveral aspects that are prioritized at the same time. Contrary to the widespread \n82 Aviel Verbruggen, and Yuliya Yurchenko\nopinion that UNFCCC must mainstream and simultaneously solve multiple major \nproblems of the world2, rational climate policy should detect spearhead issues func -\ntioning as locomotive in accelerating mitigation or adaptation. Strategic advance \nrequires forcing change via a selected issue for breaking the locks on needed techno -\nlogical, industrial and societal transitions. Thorough transformation of energy supply \nand use is widely recognized as the predominant change to perform (IPCC 2012). \nWhen COP Parties are serious about not crossing the +2°C as a dangerous, they \ndesign and agree on Individual Parties’ Emissions Contraction Scenarios  (IPECS). \nFor this, the focus is on Cpp = the average energy-related CO2 annual emissions \nper person in a nation. The Cpp indicator is a well-known Sustainable Development \nIndicator. Cpp is yearly assessed for all UN members and ranges from less than \n100 kg in least developed countries to more than 20,000 kg in a few wealthy, oil \nintensive economies (IEA 2015). \nDecomposing Cpp in three, still highly aggregated, factors provides insight \nand opens the entry to more detailed, hands-on information. The three indicators \ncan be devolved further to reach detailed groups of actors emitting CO2 in specific \nconditions, offering neat hands-on policy targets3. Respective Cpp calculation is \na multiplication of respectively wealth intensity, energy intensity of wealth, and \nCO2 intensity of energy use: \nFigure 1 presents a stylized view of Cpp ‘contraction & convergence’ scenarios \nfor a few typical Parties with the agreed upon upper limit of Cpp, which contracts \nto a low point in 2050, e.g., a maximum of 500 kg Cpp. Every Party’s scenario starts \nat its recently verified Cpp value. Every Party designs its Cpp path, respecting the \nconstraint of staying below the commonly agreed upper limit. The actual Cpp \ncontraction scenarios for sixteen, major CO2 emitting nations are documented in \nthe Deep Decarbonization Pathways Project4 2015 report. \n2 Paris Agreement p.1: “Parties should, when taking action to address climate change, \nrespect, promote and consider their respective obligations on human rights, the right to \nhealth, the rights of indigenous peoples, local communities, migrants, children, persons \nwith disabilities and people in vulnerable situations and the right to development, as well \nas gender equality, empowerment of women and intergenerational equity.”\n3 The decomposition can go on by splitting GDP in its major composing activities, by \nidentifying actors related to the various activities, by specifying the types of energy \nused, etc. At UN level the higher aggregate suffices and further detailing is the task of \nthe Parties to design the policies for controlling the values of the aggregate indicators. \nAgnolucci et al. (2009) and Verbruggen (2011) provide examples and suggestions of \ndeeper decompositions.\n4 An international consortium of research centers investigates ‘deep decarbonization \npathways’ for a set of countries, together emitting three quarters of the global ener -\ngy-related CO2 tonnage ( http://deepdecarbonization.org ).\nThe Collision of Atomic and Flow Renewable Power … 83\n83\nFig. 1  Individual Parties’ Emissions Contraction Scenarios materialize respect \nfor the maximum +2°C average temperature increase; stylized examples of \nrepresentative cases, selected by the authors. \nDecomposing energy-related CO2 emissions in constituent factors is a widespread \npractice (IEA 2015). IPCC reports take advantage of this decomposition for explain-\ning the evolution of energy-related CO2 emissions (e.g. 2014 Assessment report, \nworking group 3, chapter 6). Th  e SE4All initiative of the General Assembly (UN \n2011) wants to half the energy intensity (factor 2 of the equation) and double the \nuse of renewable energy (factor 3) in developing countries. Th  erefore, it is amazing \nthat offi   cial COP policy-making neglects the opportunities of decomposition for \naddressing the ‘complex’ and ‘wicked’ policy matters. Also MRV (Monitoring-Re-\nporting-Verifi  cation) becomes really practical because numerical indicators are \nevery year available for every factor:\n1. Th e  Budget Reform Index (BRI) for wealth intensity (GDP/person) . \nTh  e BRI should irrevocably increase year aft  er year. Budget reform is fi  nancially \npromoting sustainable low-carbon activities and charging non-sustainable ac-\ntivities, leading to restructuration of the GDP. Th  e monetary total of the GDP \nmay increase or decrease by the restructuring. Th  e discretionary power of how \nto practically organize the restructuring remains fully with the Parties. Th  e \n84 Aviel Verbruggen, and Yuliya Yurchenko\nBRI only gauges the overall net monetary pressure or thrust of policies for the \npromotion of sustainable low-carbon technologies and practices.\n2. Energy intensity (energy/GDP)  is a long-time documented indicator (Schipper \net al. 1992, 2001; Geller and Attali 2006) and widely used by national and in -\nternational energy administrations. Energy intensity combines the structure of \nan economy (how much of which activities take place) with energy efficiency \n(how much commercial energy is used by one unit of activity). The first factor is \naffected by budget reform (BRI); the second is mainly technological. Lowering \nenergy intensity is generally high on the list of (proposed) energy and climate \npolicies (IEA, EU, China). More effective progress is part of energy transitions.\n3. Carbon intensity (emitted CO2 per unit of supplied energy)  is the keystone for \ncontrolling CO2 emissions. Transitions to zero or almost zero carbon emitting \nenergy uses by 2050 is the mission for all nations in the coming decades. Their \ntransitions will be specific, due to differentiated endowment in resources, applied \ntechnologies, installed infrastructures, etc. However, all energy transitions are \nconstrained by a small set of energy supply options [Figure 2]. \nThe spearhead approach respects UNFCCC’s ‘ common but differentiated responsi -\nbilities and respective capabilities ’ in emission reductions. ‘ Common responsibility ’ \nhere is: all countries’ Cpp stays below the upper limit scenario. ‘ Differentiated ’ \nhere means: high value Cpp countries must contract first and at a fast rate (‘deep \ncuts’); low value Cpp countries (mostly developing and least developed countries) \ncan grow in Cpp value with the obligation to continue to respect the contracting \nupper limit values in future years.\n5 Few low-carbon energy supply options\nFor performing activities, the right type and quantity of energy must be sup -\nplied at the right place and time. All energy supply are a combination of some \nenergy  source  with particular technologies  for exploration, generation, conver -\nsion, and transmission of energy to the end-users. In sequence of importance, \navailable sources are: renewable flows and stocks in the natural environment, \nfossil fuel deposits in mines, wells, and shales, and uranium deposits (Figure 2)5.  \nThe environment supplies for free many energy end-use services with little technol -\nogy required for extraction or conversion, e.g., phenomena and processes such as \n5 The overview does not include the manufacturing of synfuels.\nThe Collision of Atomic and Flow Renewable Power … 85\n85daylight, ambient heat, natural ventilation and drying. Natural processes concentrate \ndiff  use renewable fl  ows (photosynthesis, the water cycle). Over the last decade, the \ncosts of man-made technologies harvesting renewable fl  ows dropped signifi  cantly\n(IPCC 2012). Photovoltaics demonstrate strong performance on cost reduction in \ncomparison with atomic (Haas 2012). Globally speaking, atomic has been showing \na slowdown on new installations and decrease of capacity as an industry since 1988 \n(Schneider, M., Froggatt, A. and S. Th  omas 2011). Technological capability announces \nfurther cost cuts, for example levelized kWh prices of conventional PV conversion \nto €ct. 4 to 6 by 2025 and €ct. 2 to 4 by 2050, although dependent on fi  nancial and \nregulatory conditions (Fraunhofer 2015). More innovative technologies can further \nreduce the costs. Costs distribution however needs to be further examined and \nrefl  ected in any future policies as EU cross-country research suggests that it is still \nthe households who bear most of the burden ‘due to higher costs of direct energy \neffi   ciency expenditures in appliances, vehicles and insulation’ (Haas et al. 2014).\nFig. 2  Overview of energy supply categories, with energy sources in [.] Source: \nauthors’ graph.\nNuclear fuel is produced from refi  ned and enriched uranium, dense deposits of which \nare limited (American Nuclear Society, 2001). Uranium shortage may be overcome \n86 Aviel Verbruggen, and Yuliya Yurchenko\nby breakthroughs in breeder or fusion technology. Commercial new breeder and \nfusion plants are not expected before 2050, the year wherein carbon free electricity \nsystems should be operational. Most essential is the high evidence that atomic \nfission power is not a sustainable power supply option (Verbruggen et al. 2014).\nFossil fuels cover a market share of above 85% of commercially traded energy \nsupply (BP 2015). Their success is due to their versatility, density, (for all scales) \ndivisibility, abundance, storability, and ability to perform on command. However, \nfossil fuel combustions cause various environmental damages and inevitably fetch \nCO2. In a low carbon future their use will be stifled (IEA 2014) but ‘carbon lock-in’ \nand related interests are exceptionally strong. A smooth phasing-out of fossil fuels \nis rather unlikely to happen (Verbruggen and Van de Graaf, 2013). Hydrogen is \na carbon free fuel but is not naturally available on earth and difficult to manage \nsafely. New industrial infrastructure may manufacture hydrogen from low carbon \nelectricity but its deployment would be a costly, long-range undertaking. Other \nnon-fossil solutions and options on storage and supply systems integration, some \nalready available, need more investment for the successful and sustainable green \nenergy transition. Electricity plays a central role in that transition as major renew -\nable energy supply (PV, wind, water) and atomic energy is generating heat, mostly \nmedium-pressure steam that is converted to electricity and delivers only power. \nThe electricity sector transformation is the inevitable vanguard of the low-carbon \nenergy transition.\n6 Climate change urges sustainable energy transitions\nThe nuclear renaissance strategy is mostly argued in terms of necessity of atomic \npower in future low-carbon scenarios. Without public money continuing to subsidize \nnew nuclear power projects, few projects will be started. Also with high subsidies, \nprivate investors in industrialised countries remain highly reluctant to invest in \nrisk-prone nuclear projects. In order to obtain public support, the atomic hubris of \nthe past century is shelved by a popular new slogan “ Nuclear power is not the only \nsolution, but there is no solution without ”. However, a majority of EU population \nprefer energy efficiency and renewable power (Eurobarometer 2015). Published \nstatistics prove the fast diffusion of flow renewable power supply by technological \ninnovation resulting in continuously declining generation costs. It has become the \nsurvival strategy of the atomic conglomerates to publicly propose co-habitance \nwith renewable power while actually undermining its development because there \nis no compatibility for lots of renewable flow power and lots of atomic power in \nThe Collision of Atomic and Flow Renewable Power … 87\n87the same power system (Verbruggen, 2008). The exclusivity is technically due to \nphysical attributes of electric currents and to the inflexibility of both atomic and \nflow renewable supply. The options perform differently on sustainable development \ncriteria at the global societal level too.\nNotwithstanding many regards towards sustainable development, IAEA skips \nthe true sustainability assessment of atomic power (Verbruggen and Laes, 2015). \nThe UK conservative government substituted the single low-carbon attribute for the \nspectrum of sustainability criteria covering Planet, People, Prosperity, Politics, and \nRisks as specific concerns. This reductionist interpretation equals the circumvention \nand obscuration of sustainable development also observable in the 2014–15 energy \nand climate policies of the EU (EC 2014a, EC 2015). Sustainability is, however, the \nprimary attribute that future energy supply and use systems should have. \nOne aspect is the readiness of energy transition pathways for emulation by \ndeveloping countries that is essential for global CO2 emissions reductions in the \ncoming decades. Low-carbon energy systems composed of non-sustainable nuclear \npower and of centralized large-scale, capital-intensive renewable plants are not \nready for emulation by the majority of developing countries. For the elimination \nof energy-related CO2 emissions, richer countries should develop and deploy \nrenewable energy supply of the kind and size also applicable and affordable by \ndeveloping countries. Indeed, there has already been progress made on the level of \nlow-carbon energy transition assistance by World Bank and USAid. Power Africa \n(PA) is an initiative launched by the Obama administration in 2013 that ‘works with \nAfrican governments and private sector partners to remove barriers that impede \nsustainable energy development in sub-Saharan Africa and unlock the substantial \nwind, solar, hydropower, natural gas, biomass, and geothermal resources on the \ncontinent’ (USAID 2013). The program’s goal is stipulated as to ‘increase electricity \naccess by adding more than 30,000 megawatts of cleaner, more efficient electricity \ngeneration capacity and 60 million new home and business connections across \nsub-Saharan Africa’ (USAid 2014). The Beyond the Grid sub-initiative aimed at \nexpansion of rural electrification and providing ‘access to small scale and off-grid \ntechnology’ is also included in PA. One main recent project is the ‘Lighting Africa’ \nprogram – a ‘joint initiative of IFC [International Finance Corporation] and the \nWorld Bank, [aimed to] help increase access to affordable, clean and safer lighting \nfor more than 30 percent of Nigeria’s population who live in rural areas, and have \nlow incomes and no access to grid electricity’ (IFC/WB 2015). The program focuses \npurely on private sector participation in electrification reform and expansion of the \nsector however the renewably sourced energy focus makes it more hopeful than \nthe Power Africa initiatives. \n88 Aviel Verbruggen, and Yuliya Yurchenko\nThere are two big problems with the above initiatives. First is the involvement of \nprivate sector in delivery – usually associated with less reliability and higher costs \n(Yurchenko and Thomas 2015). The second is the inclusion of the fossil fuel natural \ngas as an energy source option, which is not a sustainable option. The two leave us \nskeptical of the potential final economic costs and effects of the program which \nseems to mimic typical issues of climate change politics governance discussed by \nNewell et al (2015) i.e., more of the same conventional approach.\nA comprehensive sustainability assessment of nuclear fission power (Verbruggen \net al., 2014) reveals that nuclear power fails on most sustainability criteria. The needs \nof countries with poor grid development and dispersed unsatisfied household elec -\ntricity demand emphasize the shortfall of nuclear power as sustainability option.\n7 Flow renewable power and atomic power supplies  \nare incompatible\nThere is a growing literature on how integrated power generation systems may \nembed both flow renewable power (solar, wind, running water) and atomic power. \nAt the outset, this literature adopts the present non-sustainable systems as the de -\nfault position, with wind and solar power as disturbing newcomers. The incumbent \nposition is: intermittent and stochastic renewable energy supplies disturb the reliable \ndelivery of power; power on command is the reference . For a more effective and \nefficient transition the opposite viewpoint is needed: i.e., the future sustainability \ngoal situation must be treated as a benchmark for assessing present states and re -\nquired evolutions. Then the overarching guidance in the transition of the electricity \nsectors must be as follows: Intermittent and stochastic renewable energy deliver the \nmost sustainable supply and merit priority over the non-sustainable supply; with \nrespect for this sort of lexicographic priority, the supply of reliable power is organized, \nrequiring extended load management capabilities, energy storage facilities, adapted \ntransmission links to convey and match renewable power supply.\nThe atomic power and flow renewable supplies are mutually exclusive on five \nmajor directions of future power systems. First: atomic power is part and parcel \nof the expansive “business-as-usual” energy economy since the 1950s. Second, \nnuclear and renewable power need very different add-ons provided by fossil-fueled \nor bio-energy power plants, or by dam hydro power; for nuclear the add-on is large \nand expansive, for renewable power it is distributed, flexible and contracting over \ntime. Third, power grids for spreading bulky nuclear outputs are of another con -\nstellation than the interconnection between millions of distributed power sources \nThe Collision of Atomic and Flow Renewable Power … 89\n89requires. Fourth, the risks and externalities of atomic power make this technology \nnon-sustainable and therefore without a future. There is no safe or permanent way \nof disposing of nuclear waste – a problem that requires an international solution (Di \nNucci and Losada 2015), effects of potential accidents are insurmountable, climate \neffects of ore mining are underestimated, emission of radioactive isotopes ‘such as \ntritium or carbon 14 and the radioactive noble gas krypton 85’ are not discussed, \netc. (Brunnengräber, et al., 2015; Smith, 2006; Mez, 2016); while efficiency/renew -\nable power are still in their infancy particularly in terms of market shares. Fifth, \nthe antagonistic competition for R&D resources and for production capacities and \ncapabilities (e.g., trained experts) will intensify. Nuclear power and renewable power \nhave no common future in safeguarding “Our Common Future” (Verbruggen, 2008).\nFully sustainable renewable energy systems are not just technologically and \neconomically feasible but also the cheapest and only sustainable option for the \nworld’s population. Like every successful transition, sustainable energy transitions \nneed profound change in the minds, thinking, beliefs, preferences, etc. to adopt the \nnovel paradigm, perspectives, technologies, and practices. Progressive thinking and \nactions are unlikely to be delivered by those with vested interests as we mentioned \nin the case of France, AREVA, and EDF. Although detailed technical analysis of \ndynamic power systems reveals the incompatibility of flow renewable and atomic\nTijd \nAtomic base-load power \nFlow renewable power \nMW – reduced loads \nMW – expansive loads \nTijd \nhours \n hours Add-on with fuel \nor with stock  \nrenewable power \nFig. 3  A tomic versus flow renewable supply as separately serving electric loads\nSource: Verbruggen (2008)\n90 Aviel Verbruggen, and Yuliya Yurchenko\npower supplies, the prevailing discourse repeats the mantra of a simple juxtapo -\nsition of both kinds of supplies (IPCC, 2014; UNFCCC, 2015; Verbruggen and \nYurchenko, 2017). \nThis discourse can be continued when the contenders are embedded in separate \npower systems with ancillary supplies from fossil fuel based, bio-energy or hydro -\npower dam electricity. However, when 100% carbon-free power in a particular power \nsystem is due, flow renewables and atomic power will collide. Both supplies are \ncharacterized by inflexibility, although of a different kind and for different reasons. \nThere is a need for add-on current to fill the power loads from the supplied base \nonwards. Stapling supplies is the principle in merit order loading, not juxtaposing \nsupplies, because electric power is an ephemeral phenomenon switching fifty times \nper second. Figure 3 shows the juxtaposition of atomic and flow renewable supplies \nin separately serving electric loads. Figure 4 illustrates that the two contenders will \nclaim the same base-load area when operating in the same system.\nAtomic  \nbase-load  \npower \nPriority for Atomic \nbase-load power \nPriority for Flow \nrenewable power \nFig. 4  A tomic and flow renewable supplies mutual impact when operational in the \nsame power system. \nSource: Compiled by the authors on the basis of Verbruggen (2008, 2016).\nThe Collision of Atomic and Flow Renewable Power … 91\n91As is shown in Figure 3, atomic power and flow renewable supplies serve separate \npower loads. They request add-on services from flexible power supply (fossil fuel \nor bio-energy based power or dam hydropower). Now more flexibility options are \nadded like load management and storage in batteries (IEA, 2014). Supply from other \nareas in interconnected power systems is considered as a solution, although when \nthe exchange becomes intense and frequent, the power systems become deeper \ninterpenetrated. Figure 4 highlights how atomic and renewable supplies within \none electric system ruin the business case for each other as their load factors are \neroded when they cannot deliver the base loads. Researchers are looking into \npossibilities to enhance the load following capability of nuclear power plants, \nor to cut off sharp peak supply by wind or solar plants, or curtail their outputs \nfor other reasons. Most studies focus on cases of limited annual supply by flow \nrenewables (e.g., 20%, or max.45% of total annual power generated in the system) \nwith a significant share coming from company owned larger scale plants (off-\nshore wins parks; MW-scale PV fields; concentrated solar power). Our evaluation \nis that prosumers and cooperatives will become the predominant generators of \nflow renewable supply. The incompatibility between atomic and flow renewable \npower is stronger in terms of sustainability, economics, and involved agents than \nin technical operability.\n8 Conclusion\nThe global climate policy process as deployed by the UNFCCC at the yearly COPs \nis slow and vague. The participants and most media acclaim COP21, but empirical \nand theoretical literature on the commons (Hardin, 1968; Ostrom, 1990) and prob -\nlems of governance (Newell et al., 2015) predicts little positive results (Verbruggen \n2015) without a comprehensive reconstruction of the governance regime altogether. \n‘Energy transition’ is a term covering a spectrum of realities, from thorough \nand sustainable to superficial, deferring and non-sustainable lock-in. One slips in \nthe latter without a clear definition, vision, mission or strategy of sustainable and \nthorough change. The incurred delays by the slips make the thorough path steeper, \nand the irreversibility of climate change more probable.\nThe sustainable renewable energy alternative as such is not costly when fully \ndeveloped and deployed. Atomic power is and will be more expensive especially \nin the long run. Evidently, the transition process itself is challenging. Depending \non the scores by progressive, viz. reactive strategies, forces, and public support, \nthe transition difficulties and costs will be modest or high. In order to overcome \n92 Aviel Verbruggen, and Yuliya Yurchenko\nthe impasse, urgent transitions bring earlier depreciation of sunk investments. \nThe latter are more significant when incumbent energy companies reacted little \nor very late to the 1992 Rio summit and ensuing conventions. For example, after \n2000, incumbent electricity companies have still built coal power plants in the \nNetherlands and in Germany (two countries of high exposure in energy transition \nliterature and practice). This happened under the cover of the low CO2 emission \npermit prices of the failing EU ETS.\nAn assessment on nineteen sustainability criteria concluded that atomic fission \npower is not a sustainable option (Verbruggen et al., 2014). A full expansion of flow \nrenewable and atomic power supplies too are mutually undermining in terms of \nreliability of supply and economic cost alike. A conclusion thus can be made that \nsustainable transition and sustainable power supply must focus and rely exclusively \non renewable energy and renewable flow energy in particular as the main option to \ntackle climate change. The shift towards that option must happen quickly and will \nrequire coordinated efforts of countries globally. For this to be effective and making \nall parties responsible, a new, more binding, and clearly formulated framework of \ngovernance for the global environmental commons will need to replace the Paris \nAgreement and the business-as-usual functioning of the COPs.\nAcronyms and Glossary : COP=Conference of Parties at the UNFCCC (yearly since 1995); \nCpp = a Party’s average energy-related CO2 annual emissions per person; EPR= European \nPressurized reactor; IAEA=International Atomic Energy Agency; INDC=Intended Nationally \nDecided Contributions (by Parties); IPCC=Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change; \nPV=Photo-Voltaic; RE=Renewable Energy/Electricity; SD=Sustainable Development; UN -\nFCCC=United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (1992).\nThis text uses mostly ‘atomic’ rather than ‘nuclear’ because splitting (or fusion) of atoms \ngenerates other atoms, as recognized in the 1950–60s.\nThe Collision of Atomic and Flow Renewable Power … 93\n93References\nAgnolucci, P., Ekins, P., Iacopini, G., Anderson, K., Bows, A., Mander, S., Shackley, S., 2009. \nDifferent scenarios for achieving radical reduction in carbon emissions: A decomposition \nanalysis.
