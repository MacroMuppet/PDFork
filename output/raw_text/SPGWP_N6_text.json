This paper use s what might seem to be an unlikely case \nin order to question explanations of policy choices  in terms of technocracy, path dependence, \nand interest groups, against the background of an u nderestimated factor: party and coalition \nstrategies. The original data collected on public a ttitudes towards nuclear energy, and the \nattention dedicated to this issue in the media, as well as in the parliamentary and electoral \narenas, show that the effect of public opinion is c onditioned by party incentives to politicize \nthe issue at stake. In other words, parties and coa lition-making constraints act as a mediating \nvariable between citizens’ preferences and policy c hoices. These findings point to the need to \nintegrate this conditional variable into analyses of  responsiveness and models of \npolicymaking. \n \n                                                        \n1 We would like to thank Wolfgang Müller, Paul Thurne r and the participants to the PONEE project for the ir \nhelpful comments and for initially stimulating our interest in the politics and policy of nuclear ener gy.

Beyond normative principles (e.g . Schumpeter 1942; Pitkin 1967; Dahl \n1971), representatives concerned with re-election m ay perceive incentives to respond in their \npolicies to the preferences of the median voter (Do wns 1957; see also the idea of “rational \nanticipation” developed by Stimson et al. 1995). Th e “responsiveness” literature has, indeed, \nobserved a strong link between public opinion and p olicy decisions (e.g. see Jacobs and \nShapiro 1994 for an overview). \n \nHowever, interest in this factor comes mainly from specialists in public opinion, and has not \nyet been integrated systematically into public poli cy research. There is a growing academic \nawareness that politics tend to be neglected, or at  least under-estimated, in the public policy \nliterature (e.g. Bale 2008; Zohinhöfer 2009; Morten sen et al. 2011). As observed by some \nauthors, the focus is mostly set on other factors, in particular path dependence, institutional \nfriction, cognitive constraints, and the weight of interest groups, to the detriment of politics. \nResponsiveness is sometimes even seen to be increas ingly constrained by factors that include \nthe internationalization of the economy, the Europe anization of public policies, limited \nbudgetary and energy resources, and aging populatio ns. These constraints restrict the margins \nfor manoeuver policymakers have available with whic h to respond to citizens’ demands and \nto fulfill electoral promises. \n \nShould we thus conclude that policies are increasin gly made beyond public opinion, and that \npopular demands are a negligible factor for those w ho study policymaking? What to do then \nwith the results of the “responsiveness” literature ? To rigorously address these questions, \nidentifying the determinants of the variations in r esponsiveness is the most promising \napproach. Two factors have been investigated: issue  salience and institutions. This article \nemphasizes a third factor – party politics – that h as been underestimated so far in the \nacademic debate on policymakers’ responsiveness to public opinion, even if parties have been \ndescribed as the key players of modern democracy.1 \n \nBased on a study of French choices in nuclear energ y policy, this article enquires into the \nprocess by which public opinion is translated (or no t) into public policy, and it underlines the \ncrucial role played by issue politicization in part y competition. After a brief review of the \npublic policy literature through the lens of democr atic responsiveness (section 1), we show \nthat the unique stability and weight of the French nuclear power program (section 2) cannot \nbe explained using a simple “public opinion” explan ation: we observe considerable \nskepticism towards nuclear energy in French public opinion, and mass protest against it \n(section 3). Yet, even regarding this textbook exam ple of the configuration of factors likely to \nconstrain democratic responsiveness (with a highly technical and complex nature, a heavy and \ngrowing path dependence, and the combination of con siderable financial, economic, \ngeostrategic, technical and natural constraints), t he disconnection between public opinion and \npublic policy does not imply that responsiveness is  irrelevant to nuclear energy policy. Our \nanalysis of original longitudinal data on atomic pol icy in several political arenas, public \nopinion, the media and party discourses, leads us t o question explanations in terms of \ntechnocracy and constraints (section 4), against the  background of the underestimated factor \nof party and coalition strategies (section 5). Publ ic opinion appears to be relevant to \npolicymaking, but it does not exert an automatic in fluence: for responsiveness to occur, the \nissue at stake has to be politicized by at least on e political party. Models of responsiveness \nshould thus consider the conditional influence of pa rties’ strategic incentives to politicize \n 4 policies, in particular with respect to the inter-p arty dynamics of contention across diverse \nissues and with the related coalition-making constr aints. \n \n1) Bringing parties into accounts of democratic res ponsiveness  \n \nResponsiveness to voters is commonly considered to be a central aspect of democracy. At \nleast, in all liberal conceptions of democracy, rep resentatives are expected to be responsive to \nthe priorities and the expectations of the citizens  they represent. In line with this normative \nprinciple, the “responsiveness” literature has a lo ng tradition of studies that indicate that \npublic opinion, as expressed by polls, mobilization s, and mass-mediated discourses, \ncontributes to the shaping of policies (e.g. Page a nd Shapiro 1983; Hartley and Russett 1992; \nHill and Hinton-Andersson 1995; Stimson et al. 1995;  Burstein 1998; Stimson 1999; Manza \nand Cook 2002; Soroka 2002; Hakhverdian 2010), usin g sophisticated conceptualizations, \nsuch as the “thermostatic model” (Wlezien 1995; Wle zien 2004; Soroka and Wlezien 2010; \nHakhverdian 2012).  \n \nHowever, the link between public preferences and pu blic policy has not yet been established \nin sufficient detail. First, studies of responsivene ss tend to focus geographically on the United \nStates, Canada, and sometimes Britain, and to rely on row indicators, such as the general \n“public mood”, the left-right positioning of voters , the level of spending, or the broad issue \nattention of voters and legislators, which do not a llow to capture more fine-grained policy \nexpectations and decisions. Second, a series of pol itical and academic discourses highlights \nthe constraints that restrict the margins for manoe uver policymakers have available with \nwhich to fulfill electoral promises and to respond to citizens’ demands (e.g. Rose 1984; \nPierson 2000). From this point of view, given the i nternationalization of the economy, the \nEuropeanization of public policies, the limited bud getary and energy resources, aging \npopulations and, recently, constraints linked to the  functioning of financial markets, the \navailable political space is swiftly, and dramatica lly, shrinking (see Arnold and Franklin 2012 \nor Persico et al. 2012 for an overview). Some polit icians invoke such trends to advocate a \nmanagerial or technical conception of policymaking,  characterized by the search for efficient \nsolutions, rather than by decisions reflecting popu lar preferences.  \n \nPerhaps because of this context, the interest in re sponsiveness stems mainly from specialists \nin public opinion, and it has not yet been integrat ed systematically into public policy research. \nPublic opinion, and politics  more generally, tends to be left out of policy anal yses to the \nbenefit of other factors, such as institutional fri ction, cognitive constraints, path dependence, \nand the weight of parallel channels, notably the re presentation of corporatist interests. The \ngrowing irrelevance of “responsiveness” in contempo rary democracies has become a \nconventional wisdom (Jacobs and Shapiro 2000; Mair 2006). However, when empirically \nassessed, the claim of the growing irrelevance of r esponsiveness relies on studies either \ndesigned at a very high level of aggregation, or ope rationalized in a crude way, with policy \npreferences and choices defined only in terms of st atus quo vs. change (e.g. Monroe 1998; \nGilens 2005). In addition, and as already suggested , much of the public policy literature \nignores public opinion, or seems to postulate its i rrelevance rather than to demonstrate it. \nThere is no empirical reason to leave out public opi nion a priori from public policy analyses \nand the existing accounts of responsiveness stemming  from public opinion studies indicates, \nat least in some cases, that this factor does matte r. \n \nFaced with the mixed nature of the available result s, a promising research avenue consists in \nexploring the conditions under which public opinion may affect policies. A s mall number of \nstudies has demonstrated the potential of this rese arch agenda by establishing the significant \n 5 conditioning influence of political institutions (W lezien and Soroka 2012), government \npopularity (Erikson et al. 2002; Hobolt and Klemmen sen 2008) and issue salience (Monroe \n1998; Gilbert and Henry 2009; Culpepper 2011). This  article contributes to this line of \nresearch, with a focus on an underestimated factor:  party politics, coalition-making \nconstraints and the related incentives for parties to politicize choices of public policy. Our \nmain hypothesis is that, even regarding salient top ics, public opinion does not exert any \nautomatic influence on policies: for popular demand s to be translated into decisions regarding \na particular issue, this issue has to be politicize d by at least one party. Conversely, a lack of \nresponsiveness may not be due to constraints, path dependence, technocracy or interest \ngroups, but to a lack of incentives for parties to politicize specific issues.  \n \nAs a salient problem, if yet a highly technical one , marked by considerable constraints and \npath dependence (Baumgartner 1990; Baumgartner and Jones 1993), French nuclear energy \npolicy offers an intriguing field of study with whi ch to test this hypothesis. Even in this \nunlikely case in which to find partisan influence a nd democratic responsiveness, the following \nanalysis of original longitudinal data on atomic pol icy in several political arenas, public \nopinion, the media and party discourses, leads us t o question explanations in terms of \ntechnocracy and constraints. Instead it confirms th e key role of party and coalition strategies \nin the disconnection between public preferences and  French nuclear energy policy. \n \n \n2) French nuclear energy: an unlikely case of democ ratic responsiveness? \n \nPolicy decisions characterized by their stability \n \nContrary to most Western countries where nuclear po licy programs were discussed or \nlaunched, France never experienced any nuclear poli cy reversal. In this respect, it appears as a \nreal outsider, sharply contrasting with most other countries. In 1978, Austria renounced any \nuse of nuclear energy, before the first plant was e ven switched on. In the same year, a \nSwedish referendum decided on a progressive phasing -out of the use of nuclear energy. Later \nreversals occurred after the accident at Three Mile  Island, which prompted the United States \nand the United Kingdom, pioneers in nuclear develop ment, to stop their plant construction \nprogram, and at Chernobyl, after which referendums decided the end of Italian nuclear \nelectricity production (1987), and a moratorium on the construction of new nuclear plants in \nSwitzerland (1990). The subsequent rise of Green pa rties, and their participation in \ngovernments, led to further policy reversals in the  1990s, notably in Belgium (1999) and in \nGermany (2000), where votes led to a progressive ph asing-out. The 2000s saw a series of new \nreversals in favor of the nuclear industry, leading  some observers to announce a “nuclear \nrenaissance” (see Findlay 2011:1 for book examples) . The Belgian, American, Italian, British \nand German governments took measures to revive or e xtend their nuclear industry, while the \nSwedish moratorium on the construction of new plant s was lifted in 2009. Most recently, the \nFukushima accident resulted in a new series of reve rsals, in Germany, Japan and Italy, where \ndecisions were taken to phase out the use of nuclea r energy. \n \nAgainst this background, French nuclear policy dist inguishes itself by its stability. French \nnuclear policy can be traced back to 1945, when the  Commission for Atomic Energy (CEA) \nwas created as a specialized nuclear research cente r. This decision reflected three motives: a \nscientific ambition to deeply involve the French re search community in nuclear research; an \ninterest linked to the potential of a civilian use of nuclear energy for electricity production in \nthe context of post-war reconstruction; and the obj ective to develop nuclear weapons in order \n 6 to avoid a new military defeat and to gain independ ence from the United States and the Soviet \nUnion (Hecht 1998).  \n \nIn 1951, the minister Félix Gaillard proposed the f irst 5-year plan for the development of \nnuclear energy, which was adopted a year later by t he National Assembly, despite the \nCommunist MPs’ reluctance for any military use of a tomic power, and the concern of rightist \nparties to prevent the participation of communist s ympathizers in the program. This plan gave \nbirth to the first nuclear plant in 1956, and to th e development of a second one, built in 1959. \nFramed in terms of independence and industrializati on, the electricity production program did \nnot rely on existing American technology, but on ne w French technology (using graphite), \ndeveloped by the CEA. EDF, the electricity company nationalized in 1945, succeeded in \nsetting-up a collaboration with the CEA on the firs t nuclear plant, and was able commercially \nto deploy electricity produced by nuclear energy fr om 1966. \n \nThe association and balance between the CEA and EDF  structured the nuclear policy field in \nthe 1960s, crucial years for French nuclear policy (Hecht 1998). While the CEA, along with \nthe army, was focused on French nuclear independenc e and the production of plutonium for \nthe nuclear weapons program, the EDF primarily soug ht to intensify electricity production, \nand thus favored the more efficient and robust Amer ican technology, based on pressurized \nwater reactors, rather than graphite-moderated reac tors. In 1969, the government decided to \nsplit the military and the civilian wings, and allo wed the EDF to use its preferred technology. \nThis decision directly resulted in the building of a new series of nuclear plants. The \ncommitment to this industrial perspective occurred before the oil crisis of 1973-1974, but the \ncrisis reinforced it. The “Messmer plan”, adopted i n 1974, scheduled the construction of 13 \nnew plants before 1980, 50 before the middle of the  1980s, and 200 before 2000. This \noverweening program was only partially realized, gi ven the over-estimation of the growth in \nelectricity consumption in France (Bataille and Gal ley 1999; see also Guillaumat-Tailliet \n1987). In 1973, the forecast of electricity needs f or 2000 was 1000 TWh; in 1980, 650 TWh; \nin 1983, 500 TW. Finally, in 2000, the actual deman d for electricity was around 450 TWh. \n \nThis nuclear policy was not contested in Parliament  until 1997, and anti-nuclear stances were \nkept outside political institutions (Nelkin and Pol lak 1981; Kitschelt 1986; Rucht 1994). \nHowever, the 1970s were marked by an upsurge in opp osition to nuclear plants. Protests ran \nfrom local action to massive demonstrations, with v iolent confrontations with the police, \nreaching a peak of mobilization in Creys-Malville, against the Superphénix fast-breeder \nreactor, in 1976 and 1977. The anti-nuclear protest s persisted in the early 1980s, with only \nlimited policy results. The building of nuclear pla nts was briefly suspended after Mitterrand’s \nelection, in order to allow for an assessment and a  policy debate in parliament. The only \ncancellation, in 1981, in the construction of a new  nuclear plant was that planned in Plogoff. \nThe decision to slow down the construction of new pl ants was only weakly related to popular \nprotest, but was due rather to the overproduction o f electricity by the EDF.  \n \nThe 1998 decision to stop the Superphénix plant, a subject we will return to in greater detail \nbelow, was part of the agreement of the government coalition between the Socialist, \nCommunist and Green parties. This was highly symbol ic for opponents of nuclear energy, \ngiven the numerous demonstrations this experimental  plant had provoked over two decades. \nNevertheless, the level of nuclear energy production  remained unaffected, and even kept on \ngrowing. In the 2000s, despite a still positive ann ual balance in the electricity trade2, the \nsurplus has been shrinking, and imports are regular ly needed in winter, due to the decreasing \navailability in French plants, as a result of aging  and maintenance issues (Delion and Durupty \n2010: 173). After a 15 years pause (1990-2005), the se trends have motivated the decision to \n 7 extend the service life of existing plants and to b uild several EPR reactors in France. This new \ndevelopment phase was revised downwards in 2009, in  view of stagnating energy needs, but \nwas not seriously called into question after the Fu kushima accident. \nA policy of major importance  \n \nThis unique continuity of a pro-nuclear policy has generated the second largest set of nuclear \nplants in the world (58 reactors), behind the Unite d States (104). French investitions in \nnuclear research and development, as well as in nuc lear facilities, between the beginning of \nthe program and 2010, are estimated to over 83 bill ion Euros.3 As a result, France was able to \nreduce (until the mid-1980s), and then to stabilize , its oil imports, as well as to triple its \nenergy production since the 1970s, despite the decl ine of domestic natural resources (coal, \ngas, oil). So, notwithstanding scarce domestic natu ral resources, the level of dependence on \nforeign energy has regularly decreased, falling bel ow 50%, and France is able to export \nelectricity (Guillaumat-Tailliet 1987; Hadjilambrino s 2000). Nuclear energy represents 80% \nof French energy production, and almost the same pr oportion of French electricity \nconsumption, which makes France worldwide the count ry relying most on this energy. \n \nThe significance of the French nuclear program shoul d also be evaluated with respect to the \ncentral importance of the state-owned nuclear sector  to French industrial policy. The main \njustification for this persistent state control is the French concept of mission de service public,  \nwhich implies guaranteeing an equal and universal a ccess to electricity – objectives defined in \nthe 2000 law on electricity. Yet, the giant (partly ) state-owned companies are also a pillar of \nFrench industrial and commercial policy. The state has favored concentration in the energy \nsector and encouraged competition between major grou ps.4 This ‘policy of champions’, and \nthe technological advantage gained through the almo st continuous expansion of the nuclear \nindustry, fostered the emergence of high-performing  and competitive groups that are \nsuccessfully following a strategy of internationali zation (Chick 2007; Delion and Durupty \n2010). Most notably, worldwide, Areva and EDF are r espectively the leading groups in the \nnuclear energy sector and the first electricity pro ducer and provider. \n \nHow can we explain this French exception? The resol ute involvement in the nuclear option \nmay not plausibly be fully explained by the backgro und of a lack of natural resources. Other \ncountries suffering from their incapacity to meet a  strong industrial and domestic demand \nwith domestic gas, oil, mines or renewable energy s ources, Germany in particular, made \ndistinct policy choices. In most cases, phasing-out  decisions resulted from the successful \nmobilization of anti-nuclear movements and parties,  along with a hostile climate of opinion \n(Hatch 1986; Jasper 1990; Jopke 1993; Baisnée 2001) . Was public opinion more supportive in \nFrance than in other countries, was anti-nuclear co ntestation less mobilized? Or were public \nand ecologist preferences not channeled into the pr ocess of policymaking? If so, what made \npossible such an absence of democratic policy feedb ack regarding such a crucial political, \neconomic, and industrial issue? \n \n \n3) Nuclear power and French citizens: beyond the my th of a love story. \n \n \nA pro-nuclear public mood? \n \nPublic contestation over nuclear energy is consider ed to be a crucial factor for policy \nreversals, as well as a potential constraint for the  future development of nuclear \ninfrastructures. As Findlay puts it, “many of the f actors are matters of contention and \n 8 controversy, most obviously the question of the eco nomic feasibility of new nuclear build and \nthe challenges of nuclear waste disposition. The fa ct that these issues generate controversy \ncreates uncertainty for governments, industry and p rivate financiers considering investing in \nnuclear energy. This uncertainty itself acts as a b rake on a nuclear energy revival.” (Findlay \n2011; see also Ramana 2011). Public opinion is some times considered to be overwhelmingly \npro-nuclear in France. The continuity of French nuc lear policy could indeed have been \nfavored by broad popular support.  \n \nTesting this hypothesis implies estimating the leve l of support for nuclear energy and its long-\nterm evolution, a tricky enterprise, given constrai nts linked to data on attitudes towards \nnuclear energy (Jasper 1988). After having gathered  as much data as possible, enabling us to \nassess this level of public support, we have to ack nowledge the highly heterogeneous nature \nof our dataset, in terms of frequency, timing and r esponse categories. Some items were asked \nabout only once or twice, response categories and t he wording of questions changed over \ntime, and different questions lead to different ans wers, with strong framing and priming \neffects.5  \n \nIn order to deal with data heterogeneity, we resort ed to the “public mood” indicator, \ndeveloped by James Stimson in his study of liberali sm vs. conservatism in the United States \n(Stimson 1999). Based on the ‘Dyadic Ratio Algorith m’, the measure of public mood has \nbeen used increasingly to create a single public op inion indicator from heterogeneous datasets \n(Baumgartner, De Boef et al. 2008 ; Stimson et al. 2010). The “public mood” is an aggregate \nmeasure, based on survey marginals. By capturing th e shared variation, over time, of different \nseries loading on the same dimension, this measure offers an opportunity to neutralize bias \ninduced by the wording of questions. Following Stim son’s guidelines, we included in our \nindicator of public mood towards nuclear energy all  questions asked at least three times over \ntime, which allow a clear and symmetric distinction  between positive and negative attitudes \ntowards nuclear energy (See Appendix 1).6 We used the ratio of positive feelings, out of the  \nsum of positive and negative feelings for each ques tion, to compute a ‘nuclear support index’ \nthat estimates the relative level of nuclear suppor t in France.7 The French “public mood” \ntowards nuclear energy was computed using the softw are WCalc, and is based on 302 \nestimates of the ‘nuclear support index’ from 24 di fferent question wordings, collected from \n13 sources (surveys and barometers). The data obtai ned, depicted in Figure 1, covers 39 years \nfrom 1975 to 2012.  \n \nFigure 1 about here \n \nThis new indicator delivers several interesting conc lusions. The first striking observation is, \nregarding most of the period considered, the absenc e of majority support for nuclear energy \namong French citizens. Despite the bias of our supp ort index towards more support (since this \nindicator measures the proportion of supportive res pondents among those who positioned \nthemselves, this proportion would be substantially lower when calculated in relation to the \nwhole sample), our index exceeds 50% only over the 1975-1987 period, with values situated \nbetween 47,9% and 60,9% and an average of 55,1%. Th is timing is surprising, as it is set \nagainst the background of the strongest anti-nuclea r mobilizations in French history.  \n \nThe Three Mile Island accident in 1979 does not see m to have had any short-term impact at \nthis aggregate level (as the early 1980s mark a pea k in support for nuclear energy), but this \nsupport declined over the 1980s, especially after t he Chernobyl accident in 1986. This trauma \ncaused a rapid collapse, with a drop by 18,8 points  in the public mood within 5 years. \nInterestingly, perhaps due to the fading memory of Chernobyl, or due to the increasing \n 9 visibility of alternative framings, this trend was reversed in the 1990s, marked by a \nprogressive and incremental increase until 2000 – p aradoxically, by the mid-term of the \nJospin government, which involved the Green Party f or the first time.  \n \nHowever, even when the mood indicator reaches a pea k in 2000, it remains under 48,0%, and \nthe 2000s see a new low in the public mood towards nuclear energy, with values between \n44,0% and 48,0%. Eventually, the increase in suppor t observed in 2012 may be surprising at \nfirst sight, in the aftermath of the Fukushima acci dent and in the context of the diminishing \nsupport of public opinion for nuclear power plants i n most countries (Ramana 2011; Bonneval \nand Lacroix-Lasnoë 2011), the phasing-out decided b y four of France’s direct neighbors and \nthe reflections on the safety of the French plants.  As shown elsewhere, this development can \nbe understood with respect to the reframing of nucl ear energy, which goes hand in hand with \nits stronger presence in the media (Brouard et al. 2013). The members of the executive and \nthe leaders of their party have successfully emphas ized the jobs, the industrial advantages \nlinked to the nuclear sector, but also its merits i n terms of CO2 emissions. Faced with this \nright-wing offensive, the ecologists did not manage  to impose their framing in terms of risks. \nIt is still too soon to assess the long-term effect s of the Fukushima related debates but we \nshould notice that in 2012, our indicator of suppor t for nuclear energy indicates a sharp rise. \n \nThe public mood indicator computed allows, for the first time, to estimate the climate of \nopinion towards nuclear energy among French citizen s, and its evolution over almost four \ndecades, with a correction of bias linked to the wo rding of questions. This series indicates that \nFrench public support for the production of nuclear  energy is far from broad, and only \nexceptionally reaches the majority of respondents. This ambivalent, sometimes skeptical, \nclimate of opinion historically found its expressio n in a relatively strong social mobilization \nagainst nuclear energy (Nelkin and Pollak 1981; Kie rsch and von Oppeln 1983; Kitschelt \n1986; Jasper 1990; Rucht 1994; Kriesi et al. 1995; Baisnée 2001). Stemming mainly from the \necologist movement, groups such as Greenpeace, and from local collectives, like “Stop \nGolfech”, “Tchernoblaye” or the initiatives in the network “Sortir du nucléaire”, this \ncontestation took various forms, from petitioning a nd mobilizing to mass demonstrations or \nspectacular actions. French anti-nuclear mobilizati ons were vigorous in the 1970s, after the \nThree Mile Island and Chernobyl accidents, after Ge rmany’s decision to phase-out in 2000, \nand in reaction to the decision to build the first EPR plant in Flamanville, in 2005.8 Looking \nat public opinion data and at the comparative histo ry of anti-nuclear social movements thus \nreveals a gap between stable and persistent policy choices, over time, and weak and \nfluctuating public support for these choices. How c an such a gap be explained, with respect to \npolicy decisions of primary political, economic, so cial and industrial importance? \n \n \nA non-salient issue? \n \nThe disconnection between the preference of the med ian voter and the decisions of nuclear \npolicy in France could be rendered possible by a low  salience of this issue in the public \nsphere. In the case of the US nuclear energy policy , Baumgartner and Jones (1993) have \nshown how crucial issue salience in the media is fo r understanding policy change. Faced with \nthe absence of a “most important problem” barometer , we explored this possibility on the \nbasis of a study of media coverage of nuclear energ y problems, with a focus on Le Monde .9 \nThe high inter-media consistency observed in media studies (Eilders 2002; Vliegenthart and \nWalgrave 2008) justifies using this newspaper as a proxy for the French media agenda. Le \nMonde is generally acknowledged as the leading paper in F rance over the entire post-war \nperiod and its agenda-setting role has been shown t o find expression in other media – the \n 10 daily Libération , the weekly magazines Le Point and L’Express  and the news in the public TV \nchannel France 2 – taking up Le Monde ’s issue priorities (Blanchard 2010: 325-334). Figu re 2 \nprovides an overview of the salience of nuclear ene rgy in Le Monde  between 1977-2012, \nmeasured as the number per year of articles publishe d on this topic. \n \nFigure 2 about here \n \n \nOur data suggests considerable variations in the vi sibility of the nuclear issue in the media. \nAttention to this issue was consistently very high by the end of the 1970s, when continuous \nanti-nuclear protest and the Three Mile Island acci dent in 1979 provided fuel for the news \nmedia. In 1977, on average, more than 2 articles pe r day were devoted to nuclear energy, \noften on the front page. This level of importance de creased and remained, during periods of \nroutine coverage, at a non-negligible level of about  100 articles a year. Occasionally, nuclear \nenergy gained particular prominence in the media, n otably on three occasions. First, as \nexpected, the Chernobyl accident in 1986 attracted much attention, with more than one article \nper day, and an intensity of coverage still above a verage in 1987. A new peak in attention \noccurred in 1996-1997, thanks to a combination of f actors: the commemoration of Chernobyl \nin 1996, a controversy on the nuclear fuel reproces sing plant of La Hague, shaped by the \npublication of a scientific study in 1997, a specta cular and professional campaign carried out \nby Greenpeace France (Baisnée 2001), a debate opene d by the Green Party and their ministers \nabout the dismantling of the fast breeder reactor S uperphénix, as well as German discussions \nregarding the future of nuclear energy. More recent ly, media attention paid to nuclear energy \nhas risen from 2005, with a peak in 2007 in the con text of the building of EPR power plants \nafter a long pause, of the debate regarding nuclear  dissemination (often related to the Iranian \nnuclear program), global warming and the potential role of nuclear energy in the reduction of \nCO2 emissions, energy costs and availability, the “ nuclear renaissance” and the related \nopportunities for the French nuclear industry. Atte ntion remained high in 2008, notably due to \nincidents at two French fuel cycle facilities, the uranium waste treatment plant of Tricastin \nand the Cerca research reactor fuel fabrication fac ility in Romans. The data presented in \nFigure 2 does not cover the most recent years, but nuclear energy certainly acquired a historic \nlevel of visibility in the months following the Fuku shima accident and during the 2012 \npresidential campaign (Brouard et al. 2013). \n \nThus, attention on nuclear energy has gone ‘up and down’ (Downs 1972), but even in periods \nof routine coverage, nuclear energy is present in t he media. In the period 1977-2012, at least \nfive critical moments opened windows of opportunity  to politicize the nuclear issue – all the \nmore as several of them, in particular in the secon d half of the 1970s and after Chernobyl, \ncorrespond to phases of fading public support for n uclear energy. In addition, if the second \nhalf of the 1980s is not marked by any peak in medi a attention, there is a clear trend towards \nmore visibility, coupled with growing distrust on pa rt of the citizens. The hypothesis of a low \nsalience of nuclear energy issues can thus not expl ain why the predominantly negative \nattitudes of French citizens towards nuclear energy  has had virtually no impact on the course \nof French nuclear energy policy. \n \n \n4) “Kept off” the parliamentary agenda? \n \nWhen dealing with this French exception, some schol ars point to the specificity of the French \nscientific community, which is considered to be sma ller and more homogenous than in other \ncountries, with a quasi monopoly of the Corps des Mines  graduates in key positions and a \n 11 concentration of R&D resources towards research car ried out within the state controlled \ninstitutions, EDF and the CEA (Baumgartner 1990; De lmas and Heinman 2001: 449; \nSchneider 2009). This literature has revealed stron g links between nuclear research, the \nnuclear industry and nuclear policy. Boudia describe s how policymakers, scientists and \nindustrialists in charge of nuclear programs have r esponded to the growing public distrust \nwith the creation of information and public relation  devices (Boudia 2003) and how they have \nused scientific expertise in order to promote the s ocial acceptability of nuclear energy and to \nresist social protest (Boudia 2008).  \n \nNonetheless, since the mid-1970s, French scientists , in particular nuclear physicists have \nmobilized and signed public appeals against nuclear  energy (Topçu 2006), so that some \nscientific expertise might back attempts to modify the direction of French energy policy. \nFamous examples are the founding mobilization of th ousands of scholars, in 1975, and the \nestablishment of the Commission for Independent Res earch and Information on Radioactivity \n(CRIIRAD in French), an organization created after Chernobyl with the objective of \nproviding independent measures of radioactivity. Mo re importantly, the concentration of \nresearch funding on projects related to nuclear ene rgy, carried out at the EDF and the CEA, \nresult from political decisions which could have be en politicized, for instance by anti-nuclear \nMPs. The adoption of a law for environmental protec tion on 3 August 2009 may illustrate this \nargument: it was decided to rebalance research fund ing on energy in favor of “clean” energy \nsources, with the objective of spending the same am ount on them as on nuclear energy by \n2012. Similarly, Barthe (2006) has shown that the “ irreversibility” of choices regarding \nnuclear waste management, commonly acknowledged unt il the 1990s, resulted from the way \nthis political problem was constructed: alternative  management options were left aside, thanks \nto political considerations, among others. Barthe s hows how some actors have called this \nirreversibility into question since the 1990s, prov iding them with an opportunity to politicize \nnuclear waste in political arenas. \n \nIn a related vein, most authors explain that French  citizens’ distrust towards nuclear energy \nwas not channeled into policymaking with respect to  a decision-making process described \nas “restrictive”, “technocratic” and “bureaucratic”  (Kitschelt 1986; Jasper 1988; Rucht 1994; \nDelmas and Heinman 2001; Schneider 2009), which is supposed to have kept “nuclear power \noff the political agenda” (Baumgartner 1990). In thi s view, policymaking is dominated by the \nexecutive, in interaction with experts, technocrats , managers and administrators of the nuclear \nsector. Crucial decisions are taken behind close do ors, with little room left for a democratic or \npolitical debate over energy policy choices. The in stitutional setting thus leaves no chance for \nthe polarization of French public opinion finding a ny expression in the politicization of \nnuclear energy policy in either party or parliament ary debates. \n \nThe central state, the executive and the central ad ministration indeed play a crucial role in \nnuclear policymaking, both as to expertise and deci sion-making (Lucas 1979; Rucht 1994; \nDelmas and Heinman 2001). The CEA and EDF developed  plans that were submitted to the \ngovernment’s approval (often to the ministries of i ndustry, research, defense and \nenvironment) and, in the Fifth Republic, to the Pre sident. EDF and CEA were transformed \nand partially privatized in the 2000s but the influe nce of the executive remains critical, \nnotably through the appointment of chairmen and adm inistrators in both institutions. The \nexistence of a restricted, integrated and homogeneo us policy network can thus not be denied.  \n \nHowever, asserting that nuclear energy issues are m ostly or entirely kept off the political \nagenda and democratic arenas, such as the Parliamen t (Colson 1977; Hatch 1986: 150-4), or \nthat there is no division of power in this field (D elmas and Heinman 2001) would be an \n 12 exaggeration. Contrary to widespread beliefs, if ini tiatives and the elaboration of decisions \nemanate from the executive, their adoption is regul arly submitted to a parliamentary vote, so \nthat problems of nuclear energy have been a substant ial part of the legislative agendas since \nthe early 1950s. Even without counting the annual b udget laws, which often contain \ndispositions regarding expenses or taxes related to  nuclear facilities, over 50 laws dealing \nwith nuclear energy have been voted and adopted in the French parliament since 1946.10 \n \nConcrete and major decisions involving the allocati on of state credits have been scrutinized \nand voted on by French MPs, such as the five year pl ans for the development of atomic \nenergy adopted in 1952 and 1957, the law on the exp erimentation of nuclear energy and on \nbasic industries contributing to the general equipm ent of the country (1959), the electrical \nequipment program of 1961 and the creation of the E URODIF society, specializing in \nuranium enrichment and established in France. More recently, in 2005, parliament adopted a \nlaw defining the direction of energy policy, which firmly confirms the crucial place of nuclear \nelectricity in the French energy mix. \n \nFigure 3 about here \n \n \nThis is not to say that all choices in nuclear poli cy have been submitted to a parliamentary \nvote. Precise decisions regarding the timing, the g eographical implantation and the conditions \nof the construction of nuclear plants mostly take t he form of decrees, i.e. acts possibly taken \nby the executive only. However, the government has been entitled to make decrees on nuclear \nenergy by law, most importantly the 1946 law on the  nationalization of electricity and gas and \nthe 1961 law against atmospheric pollution and odor s (articles 2, 4 and 8), on the basis of \nwhich the 11 December 1963 decree set the condition s of authorization, creation and \nexploitation of nuclear facilities.11 When faced with growing popular contestation, this  \nlegislative setting could have been amended. This i s, indeed, what occurred in 2006, when the \nlaw on nuclear transparency and security was adopte d as the first (French) legislative frame \nspecifically designed for nuclear activity. Since t hen, the Authority of nuclear safety plays an \nimportant role in the authorization of new plants a nd in ensuring transparency towards the \npublic and parliament. \n \nThe adoption of the 2006 law, and the subsequent re vision of the institutions ruling nuclear \nactivities, have opened a window of opportunity for  politicizing nuclear energy. In previous \ndecades, already, such opportunities had been provi ded through the regular agenda setting of \nquestions of nuclear cooperation (AIEA, EURATOM…) a nd of nuclear safety. Between 1965 \nand 2006, we were able to identify no less than 22 laws dedicated to matters of safety of \nnuclear power plants, treatment sites and radioacti ve waste disposal sites. Given this focus on \nrisks and uncertainty, these deliberations could ha ve given rise to a democratic debate on the \ndirection of French energy policy and to an effecti ve parliamentary scrutiny. The substantial \nplace reserved for issues linked to nuclear energy may also be illustrated by the considerable \nattention devoted to it by the parliamentary commit tee specializing in technological and \nscientific issues – Office Parlementaire d’Evaluation des Choix Scienti fiques et Techniques . \nSince its creation in 1983, 36 reports (out of 198)  deal with the nuclear energy issue, with \nreflections on the consequences of Chernobyl, nucle ar safety and security in France and \nbeyond, the management of highly radioactive waste,  the costs of the production of nuclear \nelectricity, the life span of power plants, the fut ure of the French nuclear sector, and so on. \n \nIn short, the institutional setting of French nucle ar energy policy alone cannot be blamed for \nthe absence of democratic debate. There is no insti tutional factor definitively preventing \n 13 parliamentary representatives from making energy po licy a salient issue, or from channeling \ncitizens’ negative feedback regarding French nuclea r energy policy. Several nuclear \ndevelopment programs have been submitted to a parli amentary vote, as were the laws that \nhave shaped the decision-making rules of nuclear ene rgy policy. If the decision to construct \nnew plants has not been put on the parliamentary age nda for decades, MPs have deliberated \non reports covering all facets of nuclear energy, a s well as on a series of laws on issues of \nnuclear research, cooperation, responsibility and s afety. Yet, the related parliamentary debates \nnever gave rise to any major cleavage before the fi rst election of Green MPs in 1997. The \nsuccessive plans of nuclear development and expansi on in the 1950s, 1960 and 1970s were \nsupported by all parliamentary parties. In debates over French energy policy, MPs seem to \nshare common objectives that are very favorable to the nuclear sector: to secure nuclear \nactivities, to legitimate them, to develop them and  to convince European partners of their \nnecessity. The absence of visible and influential c ontroversy thus seems to result from nuclear \nenergy being treated by MPs as a valence issue. In the remaining section of this article, we \nargue that this depoliticization cannot be understo od without party politics and coalition-\nrelated strategies into account. \n \n \n5) Party politics and the misfit between opinion an d policy choices \n \n \nVote-related incentives to contest nuclear energy \n \nA reversal in French nuclear energy policy would ha ve required an agent implementing an \nanti-nuclear policy. Parties’ incentives to respond to citizens’ skepticism towards nuclear \nenergy may be shaped by the preferences among their  voters. Figure 4 shows that the \ndistribution of preferences of nuclear energy diffe rs substantially among the supporters of left \nand right parties.12 While the majority of the electorate of parties of  the right and far-right \n(between 50 and 70%) supports nuclear energy, this proportion is much smaller among \nCommunists and Socialists (between 40 and 50%) and especially among ecologists (20%). \nThe level of nuclear support among the supporters o f all four traditional governing parties has \nbeen eroded since the beginning of the 1980s. For b oth rightist parties, the level of nuclear \nsupport decreased from three fourths in 1980 to a s light majority in 2005. After 1986, among \nPS sympathizers, the proportion of nuclear supporte rs fell and remained below 40%. Voters \nof the Communist Party (PC), traditionally among th e most pro-nuclear, are no exception to \nthis trend. The decline of this party has been accom panied in the last 15 years by the \naffirmation of other far left and Trotskyist partie s, whose sympathizers are as opposed to \nnuclear energy as the ecologist parties. In sum, the  decline in support for nuclear energy \naffects all parties’ constituencies. Coupled with m ass protest against nuclear energy and the \ngrowing social, political and economic implications  of this policy, this may have generated \nelectoral incentives to advocate and promote a poli cy reversal, especially in the 1980s.  \n \nFigure 4 about here \n \n \nThe long depoliticization of nuclear energy in Fran ce: office – and policy-related incentives \n(1946-1989) \n \nThe growing skepticism of French voters was not fol lowed by any realignment, as all French \nparties have depoliticized nuclear energy in their official positions and in their electoral \ncampaigns.13 This depoliticization results in the low salience of matters of nuclear energy \n 14 policy in party discourses (1) and in the broad cons ensus on a pro-nuclear stance, involving \nall parties (2). The first point may be illustrated by the marginality of nuclear energy in the \nelectoral manifestos of the main parties between 19 58 and 1988, when compared to the \nfurther relevant issues of “farmers” and “culture”,  as measured by the Comparative Manifesto \nProject (Figure 5).  \n \nFigure 5 about here \n \n \nThis comparison highlights the modest attention to nuclear energy within the four main \nparliamentary parties. Nuclear energy is mostly far  less salient than other issues of similar, or \neven smaller, scope, be it in the manifestos of the  main left parties, or in those of the Gaullist \nparty, which is the one that historically pushed th e expansion of nuclear energy. Beyond this \nlow salience, the depoliticization of nuclear energ y has also resulted, for a long time, in the \nconvergence of the main French parties toward pro-nu clear stances. The enduring misfit \nbetween citizens’ preferences on a salient issue, o n the one hand, and electoral supply and \npolicy decisions, on the other, cannot be understoo d without taking into account all \nmotivations of party representatives, who are not on ly concerned with attracting votes, but \nalso with policy- and office-related considerations (Müller and Strom 1999).  \n \nThe interest of elected representatives in channeli ng the popular preference for a policy \nreversal varies a lot according to their party. The  ideology or the political project of each \nparty goes along with distinct policy preferences. The conservative parties anchored in the \nGaullist tradition lean towards nuclear energy14, given their commitment to national \nindependence and their proximity to representatives  of the nuclear sector. On the other side of \nthe political spectrum, the Communist Party is tradi tionally the most fervent advocate of \nnuclear energy15, which is congruent with its proximity to EDF’s do minant trade union CGT, \nthe ideological belief of the PC in the power of sc ience and technology to transform the \nworld, its productivist orientation and the priorit y set by this party on the improvement in the \nstandard of living, job creation and preservation. The pro-nuclear stance of the PC may also \nbe linked to the firm commitment of the USSR in mas sive programs of nuclear energy \ndevelopment, and to the high number of Communist sc ientists involved in French nuclear \nresearch, most notably the first director of the CE A, Frédéric Joliot-Curie. The political \nprogram of other parties, such as the Socialist Par ty (PS), the Centre Party (UDF) and the \nNational Front (FN) has no such clear and straightf orward implication regarding their position \ntowards nuclear energy.  \n \nIn this respect, and provided that the pro-nuclear policy was implemented by the rightist \ncoalition involving the UDF16, a policy reversal was most likely to emanate from  the PS. The \nonly party opposed to nuclear energy was actually t he small Unified Socialist Party, which \npartly merged with the Socialist Party in 1974. The  PS is traditionally close to the only anti-\nnuclear mainstream organization, the trade union CD FT (Garraud 1979; Nelkin and Pollak \n1980), and closer to anti-nuclear protest than the Communist Party, with Socialist activists \nheavily involved in national and local protest. How ever, this party did not provide the \ninfluential ally anti-nuclear movements would have needed in order to reverse the course of \nFrench nuclear energy policy. Confined in oppositio n for decades, the PS representatives were \nmore concerned with accommodating the pro-nuclear s tance of the main coalition partner, the \nPC, than with responding to anti-nuclear voters. Th e interplay of policy- and office-related \nmotivations and their consequences for French nucle ar policy choices is particularly striking \nwhen looking at the critical juncture of nuclear ex pansion and political alternation (1973-\n1985). \n 15  \nThe second part of the 1970s is a key moment for nuc lear energy policy, with an acceleration \nin the rhythm of construction of new plants and a q uick rise in nuclear electricity production. \nThe development of mass anti-nuclear protest and th e Three Mile Island accident could have \nfostered the politicization of nuclear energy in th e electoral and parliamentary arenas and, at \nthat point in time, contestation by the parliamenta ry opposition, or the decision to phase out, \ncould have had huge consequences on the scope of th e French nuclear program. However, \nparties did not respond to this challenge with a po liticization of nuclear energy policy, but \nwith a strategy of issue avoidance. This is in part icular the case of the Socialist Party, faced \nwith intense party-internal debates between pro- an d anti-nuclear positions and with the \nnecessity of accommodating the pro-nuclear Communis t Party as the only possible partner for \ncoalition building. Already at the 1973 legislative  elections, the Communist and Socialist \nparties had defended a common manifesto that was he avily pro-nuclear, acknowledging the \nkey role played by the CEA in the French research po licy and defending state support for the \ndevelopment of nuclear power plants, run by a publi c nuclear industry. Focused on the \nobjective of seizing power thanks to an alliance wi th the PC, the PS ignored the peak of anti-\nnuclear protest in France and centered its 1978 cam paign on other issues. After the leftist \nalliance came close to winning a majority, the like ly perspective of winning the 1981 \npresidential election made alternation and office e ven more the priority.  \n \nThe common platform of PS and PC had to be defined on a common denominator: state \nintervention in the economy through nationalization  and an active industrial policy provided \nthe ground for a coalition agreement. From the poin t of view of each party, politicizing \nnuclear energy may have attracted more votes but wo uld undoubtedly have undermined a \nleftwing coalition and thereby rendered impossible the 1981 alternation. This calculus sheds \nlight on the strategy pursued by both parties. On t he one hand, the Socialist Party adopted a \nsoft stance: limiting the nuclear program to the nu clear plants already under construction, \ntaking time for a national debate, holding a refere ndum on nuclear energy development, and \nenacting legislation guaranteeing the transparency of nuclear plant security. The socialist \ncandidate and future President François Mitterrand also promised a moratorium on the \nconstruction of any new nuclear plant. On the other  hand, the manifesto presented by the \nCommunist Party was the first to keep silent on nuc lear strategy and, since then, this party has \nmostly omitted the topic.  \n \nPolicy-related arguments went against a phasing out  of the nuclear program as well. In the \n1970s, François Mitterrand had steadily emphasized the importance of remaining independent \nand even promoted the idea of turning back to the F rench graphite technology. A nuclear \nphasing out would have also undermined the prospect s of the macro-economic policy planned \nby the French left. Nuclear energy was seen as an i llustration of the merits of state-owned \ncompanies for building and exploiting large infrast ructures, but also as a source of cheap \nenergy for future industry development and a sector  employing thousands of employees. In \naddition, most nuclear plants were already under co nstruction, or nearly finished by 1981, so \nthat a drastic phasing out would have been very cos tly. The most expensive part of the nuclear \nprogram had already been realized and hence would h ave caused considerable stranded \ninvestment, on which costs linked to the search and  the funding of alternative energy supply \non the market would have been added. The correspond ing funding would not have been \navailable for the nationalization policy strongly d esired by the coalition of the left.  \n \nAs long as the entry costs into the French politica l system were high enough to forbid any \nanti-nuclear party being pivotal, the Socialist Par ty had incentives to stick to nuclear energy. \nAfter the left coalition won the presidency and a l egislative majority in 1981, only symbolic \n 16 pay-offs for anti-nuclear activists were delivered,  as for example the criticisms against the \nundemocratic nuclear policymaking implemented by the  rightist government (e.g. the location \nof the nuclear plants) before 1981, the 6 month mor atorium, and the cancellation of the \nPlogoff nuclear plant. These symbolic pay-offs chal lenged neither the principle of using \nnuclear energy, nor the building of new plants afte r 1981. Indeed, even two years after the \nChernobyl accident, the Socialists presented to the  1988 national elections the most pro-\nnuclear platform ever: “Which country is the only on e that succeeded in developing nuclear \nenergy in order to overcome the scarcity of our nat ural resources? It is ours, because it \nsucceeded in organizing a 20-year plan, which no pr ivate company would have been able to \ndo”. Given the skepticism, which prevails in French public opinion, this situation generates a \nmisfit between the preferences expressed by citizens  and party representatives. In 1982, the \n“French and Science” barometer indicates that aroun d 70% of citizens opposed to nuclear \nenergy sympathized with pro-nuclear parties. This f igure remained high in the following \ndecades, reaching nearly 90% in 1989. The relevance  of this explanation of the continuity of \nthe French nuclear policy is underscored by the con trast with the patterns stemming from \nanother critical juncture. \n \n \nChanging coalition-related incentives with limited p olicy consequences: the lack of policy \nopportunities (1989 - 2012). \n \nIf the ecologist movement had run in the French nat ional elections since the presidential \ncontest of 1974 (gaining 1%), it became a relevant player only from the late 1980s. This \nsituation changed from 1989, with the Greens’ break through at the municipal elections in \nMarch and at the European elections in June. In 1992 , for the first time, ecologists were \nsuccessful in the 1992 regional elections, which al lowed them to be represented in a decision-\nmaking institution for the first time. With 14.3 % of votes, more than two hundred ecologists \nentered the French regional councils. The distribut ion of seats and political parties located the \ntwo ecologist parties as pivotal players in many re gions, as they formed regional coalitions \nwith either right or left parties, and provided ext ernal support for formal minority \ngovernments (Brouard 1999). The 1993 legislative and  the 1995 presidential elections \nconfirmed the ecologists’ electoral strength. Despi te the instability of their organization and \nof their leadership, the Green party became increas ingly relevant and strategic. The rise of this \nparty was associated to an emphasis on new issues, among which, nuclear energy was \nparticularly important. In the 1990s, the Greens we re the only party addressing the \nenvironmental issue, with concerns regarding nuclea r risks and decision procedures \njudged “undemocratic” and too centralized. Issue av oidance and consensus regarding nuclear \nenergy in electoral competition were suddenly broke n by the emergence of the Green Party. \nAs shown in Figure 5, the Green party devotes a hig her share of its programs to nuclear \nenergy. More importantly, the concern expressed by the Green Party regarding long-term \npollution and industrial risks implies strong anti- nuclear policy preferences. \n \nThe PS and, above all, the PC simultaneously saw th eir electoral support shrinking and felt \npressure from the Green Party electorally , given the attractiveness of the Greens in the lef tist \nconstituency; politically , with new issues entering the electoral agenda; an d strategically , with \nthe Greens becoming a pivotal player in potential l eft coalitions. This development changed \nthe incentives to politicize nuclear energy. In a n utshell, the PS faced the challenge of limiting \nelectoral losses, dealing with new issues, and rema ining in the capacity of leading a left \ncoalition, which would probably have to include the  Greens. PS representatives \nacknowledged the necessity of signaling their willi ngness to form a coalition with the Green \nParty and their openness to their policy proposals.  These considerations regarding an \n 17 anticipated coalition with the Greens probably expl ain why pro-nuclear arguments vanished \nfrom the PS manifesto in 1993 and why the PS substa ntially revised its discourse in the 1997 \nlegislative campaign, adopting a much more negative  tone towards nuclear energy: “We will \nchange the course of French energy policy by adopti ng a moratorium on the building of \nnuclear plants, by increasing the incentives to ene rgy saving and to the development of \nalternative energy sources. We will close the fast breeder reactor Superphénix.” \n \nNuclear policy was for the first time affected by a n effective Green pressure in 1997–1998, \nwhen Greens entered the plural left coalition (1997 -2002) with the PS and the PC. The \ngovernment decided on the closure of the experiment al plant running the fast-breeder reactor \nSuperphénix. Yet, this reversal was mainly symbolic  and did not hinder the connection of new \nnuclear plants to the electricity grid and a peak i n nuclear electricity production. The \npromised moratorium on nuclear plant construction w as never voted on, even if it was de \nfacto implemented. This is not necessarily linked to Gree ns being in government, as the \nnuclear development plan was already fully realized and as no nuclear plant reached its \nprojected end of life during this period. Neverthel ess as soon as the rightwing coalition came \nback to power in 2002, the nuclear program was imme diately re-launched with the decision to \nbuild a new plant in Flamanville, followed by a sec ond one in 2009, planned in Penly. If the \nGreens did not achieve a reduction of the weight of  nuclear energy, they probably precluded a \nfurther extension of the French nuclear program as long as they were in office. Given the \nhighly constraining legacy of past policy choices, downsizing the nuclear program would \nhave been more costly in 1997 than in 1981: the dis crepancy between political time and \npolicy time gave the Greens little opportunity to f urther challenge French nuclear policy. \n \nThe logic induced by the changing coalition-related  incentives has persistent effects. The \nnuclear issue became contentious during the last tw o waves of presidential and parliamentary \nelections. In 2007, presidential candidate Ségolène  Royal and the Socialist Party manifesto \nannounced for the first time a decrease in the propo rtion of nuclear energy through an \nincrease in the share of renewable energy by 20% of  total energy consumption by 2020 (and \n50% in a longer term). The conservative party candi date, Nicolas Sarkozy, reacted to this \nproposition by stressing the merits of nuclear ener gy in terms of CO 2 emissions and \ncomparative industrial advantage, so that this issue  was hotly discussed during the TV debates \ninvolving the opposing candidates, which took place  between the two rounds of the \npresidential election. The visibility of questions related to nuclear energy was even stronger in \nthe run up to the 2012 national elections which too k place in the aftermath of Fukushima, and \nin the context of the decisions of several countrie s to phase out the use of nuclear energy. The \nPS took a more critical position and promised to re duce the share of nuclear energy in \nelectricity production by 25% before 2025, to open a debate over energy policy, to set a \nmoratorium on the construction of new plants until the end of this debate, to close the aging \nFessenheim plant and to give up the construction of  a further EPR in Penly. Public \ncontroversies resulted from the decision of the con servative party UMP and of the executive \nto politicize their pro-nuclear stance and to frame  nuclear energy in terms of employment, \npurchase power and reliability. As a result, the is sue seems to be absorbed by the traditional \nleft-right cleavage, with parties on the left (exce pt the PC) being more opposed to nuclear \nenergy than parties on the right (Brouard et al. 20 13). According to our theoretical \nperspective, under these political conditions, demo cratic responsiveness is more likely – \nwithin the limits of the policy legacy. The 2012 pol itical alternation was associated with 3 \npolicy decisions: the oldest nuclear plant (Fessenh eim) will be shut down in 2016-2017 \ndespite the recent authorization of the extension of  its life span; the nuclear plant under \nconstruction (Flamanville) will be finished and conn ected to the grid; the newest project \n 18 (Penly) is canceled. Nevertheless any long term and  effective policy effect remains to be \nobserved.  \n \nCONCLUSION \n \nThis paper contributes to the study of the role of democratic responsiveness in policymaking. \nThis theoretical perspective also allows us to cast  fresh light on the determinants of French \nnuclear energy policy. Based on the analyses of ori ginal longitudinal data on public opinion, \nparliamentary activities, public policy development s and party politics over the post-1945 \nperiod, we question two current explanations for th e unique stability of pro-nuclear choices in \nFrance. First, our measure of public mood toward nuc lear energy shows that this stability does \nnot reflect a pro-nuclear climate of opinion: we ob serve a persistent gap between French \npublic opinion and policy choices. As we demonstrat e that nuclear energy has been on the \nagenda for both the media and parliament for more t han 50 years, this result suggests that, \neven regarding salient issues, dynamics of democrat ic responsiveness are less strong and \nautomatic than suggested in the opinion-policy lite rature. Second, arguments in terms of \ntechnocracy, interest groups, path dependence and “ constraints” of all kinds cannot fully \naccount for the observed lack of democratic respons iveness. We contend that this explanation \nhas to be complemented with respect to a neglected variable: party politics. \n \nThe continuity of French pro-nuclear policy does in deed appear to be rooted in the issue-\navoidance strategy of the main political parties, r einforced by the increasing inertia of past \ndecisions on nuclear energy policy. The historical lack of strategic incentives to encourage the \nmain parties to focus on this issue can be explaine d by considerations relating to policy, office \nand vote. On the one hand, parties on the right of the political spectrum were policy-oriented \nin their pro-nuclear stances, as was the PC. These pro-nuclear formations had no interest in \npoliticizing an issue over which they were not in t une with the majority of French voters. On \nthe other hand, the Socialist Party had to accommod ate its communist coalition partner and \nsought to focus on issues that were not contentious  within the PC. These constraints at the \nparty level have become combined with the imperativ e for individual legislators to be re-\nnominated by their party for the next election, whi ch created incentives to avoid questions of \nnuclear energy policy in the parliamentary arena and  to observe party discipline when voting \nover nuclear energy. The comparative analysis of tw o critical junctures of French nuclear \nhistory underlines the relevance of our explanation.  As long as the Greens remained a \nmarginal party, the Three Mile Island and the Chern obyl accidents did not shape party \ndiscourses of nuclear energy: for a long time, neit her major shocks, nor the resulting social \nmobilization, and shifts in public opinion, affecte d French nuclear policy. The pro-nuclear \nconsensus was broken only after the Green Party bec ame a potential coalition partner for the \nSocialist party: the PS manifesto has become less a nd less pro-nuclear since then, in order to \npreserve the pre-electoral coalition with the Green s. \n \nBeyond the case of nuclear energy, we hope that thi s article is convincing about the potential \nof studying politics and policies together, even in the case of a policy field marked by a high \ndegree of technical content, heavy path dependence,  powerful interest groups, and \nconsiderable economic and natural constraints. The influence of public opinion and mass \nprotest is neither a priori negligible, nor automat ic and autonomous, but relies on further \nmediating variables. Our results confirm observatio ns made by other scholars of the \nimportance of issue salience to understand precisel y when public opinion is translated into \npublic policy (Monroe 1998; Gilbert and Henry 2009;  Culpepper 2011) and suggest that \nsalience is not a sufficient condition. A further, crucial variable should be considered in \nmodels of responsiveness: the inter-party dynamics of contention across issues. Strategic \n 19 incentives to politicize nuclear energy appear to be  a necessary condition for responsiveness \nto occur in France. Nevertheless, more comparative work is required across policies and \npolities in order to understand the interplay betwe en salience, institutions and party politics in \nthe responsiveness process. For example, how the in stitutional setting might mitigate the \neffect of party politics is a promising area. A sys tematic assessment of the conditions under \nwhich public opinion may shape policies is currentl y one of the most challenging research \nagendas in public policy analysis. \n \n \nReferences \n \nArnold C. and Franklin M.N.

Our argument is that the literature  tends to \nneglect the mediating role that political parties m ay play between public opinion and public policy.  \n2 According to government statistics ( http://www.statistiques.developpement-\ndurable.gouv.fr/rubrique.php3?id_rubrique=550 ), electricity exports were superior to imports by 70 TWh in \n1995. This trade surplus tended to diminish in the 2000s – it fell to 60 TWh in 2005 and to 26 TWh in 2009 – but \nremained positive.  \n3 See the report published in 2012 by the national a udit office, available online: \nwww.ccomptes.fr/Publications/Publications/Les-couts -de-la-filiere-electro-nucleaire .  \n4 Four huge groups had dominated the sector for a lo ng period of time: Cogema (a CEA department dealing  with \nR&D and nuclear safety), EDF (the sole company engi neering nuclear plants), the Empain-Schneider group  \n(building the main components of the plants through  its subsidiaries Framatome and Creusot-Loire), and  the \nAlsthom-Atlantique branch of the CGE group. Since 2 001, the main group has been AREVA (which was a \nfusion of the CEA Industry department with Framatom e and Cogema).  \n5 The level of support varies considerably if respon dents are asked about their general position, on th e phasing-\nout option or on the non-replacement of aging power  plants. This type of framing effect explains that two polls \nrealized in the aftermath of the Fukushima accident  generated diametrically opposite conclusions. Whil e the \nSofres poll ordered by EDF, realized on March 15th and 16th, concluded that 42% of the sample were in favor of \na phasing-out, another poll performed by IFOP for t he Green party estimated this share by 70%.  \n6 The data stems from regular barometers (Eurobarome ter; IRSN; CREDOC; EDF), French election surveys \n(panel electoral français ; Trielec), as well as from surveys implemented by the institutes IFOP, IPSOS, Sofres \nand BVA. All these surveys are based either on rand om or quota samples and were implemented in face-to -face \nor telephone interviews. The N is in almost all cas es superior to 1000 – except, due to missing cases,  in some \nEurobarometer items, where the N still systematical ly remains above 900.  \n7 People refusing to position themselves, i.e. non-r espondents and respondents adopting a “neutral” pos ition, \nwere not included in the calculus of the ratio. By construction, the nuclear index is sensitive to the  change in \nmind from positive to negative feelings or vice-ver sa, but also from indifferent and ambivalent feelin gs to \npositive and negative feelings.  \n8 On the basis of a protest event analysis using med ia and other sources, Swen Hutter has recently prod uced an \nindicator of the anti-nuclear protest mobilization in eleven countries (Hutter, forthcoming). Over the  1975 to \n2011 period, France (along with the Netherlands) fe atures an intermediate level of mobilization, with fewer \n                                                                                                                                                                              \n28 participants than Germany, Austria and Switzerland but significantly more than countries such as Brita in, Italy, \nSpain, the US, Belgium and Sweden. However, in the second half of the 1970s, the French and the Swiss \nmovements appear to be the strongest.  \n9 Between 1977 and 2001, we relied on the annual Ind ex Le Monde  to study the nuclear issue coverage in Le \nMonde. This tool lists all articles published by the news paper by topic and includes several categories link ed to \nnuclear energy (“nuclear energy”, “nuclear accident ”, “nuclear security”), allowing to count how many articles \nwere devoted, each month, to this issue. As the ann ual Index Le Monde  was published only until 2001, we used \nthe thematic index of the online database Factiva t o complete our time series, by counting all article s indexed as \ncovering the topic of “nuclear energy”. In order to  control for possible differences between the elect ronic and \nindexed content of Le Monde , we used all the available years on Factiva (1995– 2008). The analysis of the seven \ncommon years proved that a source effect exists, bu t that this effect is weak and both sources are hig hly \ncorrelated.  \n10 A list of these laws is available upon request to the authors.  \n11 The 1972 law authorizing the creation of enterpris es exerting, on French soil, electrical activity of  European \ninterest, and the 1976 law on installations classif ied for environmental protection, are also quoted a s a reference \nin many nuclear energy decrees.  \n12 We used the same question asked in three waves of the survey ‘The French and Science’ fielded in 1982 , 1989 \nand 1994. We also used two complementary surveys: a  1980 SOFRES poll using the same question wording a nd \na 2005 IFOP survey. The level of nuclear support re presents the percentage of respondents taking posit ion in \nfavor of nuclear energy, i.e. positioning themselve s between 4 and 6 on a six-point scale going from ‘ strongly \nagainst nuclear plants’ to ‘strongly in favor of nu clear plants’.  \n13 The following description of campaign discourses o n nuclear energy has been established on the basis of the \npress coverage of campaigns, as well as on the part y programs, as collected by the Comparative Manifesto \nProject, which were kindly provided by the CMP archive, lo cated at the GESIS (Cologne). Where possible, \nthese manifestos were completed with previously mis sing ones, for instance several UDF and FN programs . A \nlist of these documents is available upon request.  \n14 For example, as early as 1958 the Gaullist Party p latform focused on the energy sector as a priority:  the need \nto go from research about ‘the resources of the ato m’ to industrial application was emphasized.  \n15 From 1958 to 1978, the Communist Party had explici tly repeated the need for ‘the development of a pow erful \nand peaceful nuclear industry’.  \n16 In 1978, the UDF party manifesto was in favor of ‘ the increase of our own energy resources, particula rly the \nnuclear ones (…)’ and ‘the implementation of the nu clear program during the next 5 years’. \n \n \nAuthors: \nSylvain Brouard ( s.brouard@sciencespobordeaux.fr )  \nCentre Émile Durkheim / Sciences Po Bordeaux \n11, Allée Ausone \nDomaine Universitaire \nF-33607 Pessac Cedex (France) \n \n(corresponding author) Isabelle Guinaudeau ( isabelle.guinaudeau@sciencespo-grenoble.fr )  \nPacte / Sciences Po Grenoble \nBP48 \nF-38040 Grenoble Cedex 9 (France)  \n",
