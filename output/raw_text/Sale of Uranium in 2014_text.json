  "text": "SECRETARIAL DETERMINATION\nFOR THE SALE OR TRANSFER OF URANIUM\nHaving considered the requirements of the United States Enrichment Corporation Privatization\nAct of 1996 (42 U.S.C. 2297h-2297h-10), the current status of the domestic uranium mining,\nconversion, and enrichment industries, and the Departmentâ€™s analysis regarding the potential\nimpacts of the sales or transfers of a total of 2,705 MTU natural uranium equivalent per calendar\nyear as follows:\n1) up to 2,055 MTU per year of natural uranium equivalent contained in natural uranium\nand natural uranium from off-specification non-uranium hexaflouride transferred to\nDOE contractors for cleanup services at the Paducah or Portsmouth Gaseous\nDiffusions Plants, in quarterly transfers of up to 600 MTU for the period 2014\nthrough 2021; and\n2) up to 650 MTU per year of natural uranium equivalent contained in low-enriched\nuranium (LEU) transferred to NNSA contractors for down-blending highly-enriched\nuranium to LEU for NNSA programs for the period 2014 and 2022;\n3) Provided that, in the event the NNSA transfers do not reach 650 MTU in any year,\nEM may transfer in excess of 600 MTU in the fourth quarter of that same calendar\nyear so long as the total amount transferred by the Department does not exceed 2,705\nMTU natural uranium equivalent in that year.\nI have determined that these Departmental sales or transfers will not have an adverse material\nimpact on the domestic uranium mining, conversion, or enrichment industries. I have taken into\naccount the sales of uranium under the Russian Highly Enriched Uranium Agreement and the\nSuspension Agreement.\nfo HAY 18 20\nEmest J. Moniz . Date\n\n",
