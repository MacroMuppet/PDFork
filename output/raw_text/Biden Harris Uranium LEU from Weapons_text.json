Today’s announcement\nreinforces the Biden-Harris Administration's commitment to ensuring consumers across the country have access to\naffordable, reliable electricity and good-paying clean energy jobs, while building resilient supply chains free from\nRussian influence.\n“These contracts generated from this action will help spur the safe and responsible build-out of uranium enrichment\ncapacity in the United States,” said Principal Deputy Assistant Secretary for Nuclear Energy Dr. Michael Goff. “We\nmust increase our capacity to produce enriched uranium domestically to support the energy security and resilience of\nthe Nation.”\nDOE selected these 6 companies that will be able to compete for future work to supply LEU, fostering strong\ncommercial sector investment:\n\n« American Centrifuge Operating, LLC\nhttps:/www.energy.gov/ne/articles/biden-harris-administration-announces-contracts-buy-us-sourced-low-enriched-uranium 42\n\n213/25, 4:42 AM Biden-Harris Administration Announces Contracts to Buy U.S.-Sourced Low Enriched Uranium | Department of Energy\n« General Matter, Inc.\n« Global Laser Enrichment, LLC\n* Louisiana Energy Services, LLC\n* Laser lsotope Separation Technologies, Inc.\n« Orano Federal Services, LLC\nDeveloping new domestic production capacity for LEU ensures an adequate fuel supply is available from trusted\nsources to maintain the current fleet of U.S. reactors and builds a strong base to supply future deployments of\nadvanced nuclear reactors both at home and abroad. Through these contracts, DOE will acquire LEU generated by new\ndomestic sources—either at entirely new facilities or from projects that expand existing capacity. All contracts will last\nfor up to 10 years and each awardee receives a minimum contract of $2 million.\nMore information on DOE's efforts to develop nuclear fuel supply chains for existing and future reactors can be found\nat Domestic Low Enriched Uranium Supply Chain | Department of Energy.\nMedia Contact Information\nPhone: 202-586-4940\nEmail: doenews@hq.doe.gov\n. *\nSubscribe for Updates mi\nQuick Links Resources Federal Government\nCommitted to Restoring Leadership & Offices Budget & Performance USA.gov\nAmerica’s Energy Dominance.
