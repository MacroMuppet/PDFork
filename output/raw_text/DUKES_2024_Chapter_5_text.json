  "text": "  \n \n1 \n Chapter 5: Electricity \nVanessa Martin  0776 757 3907  electricitystatistics@energysecurity.gov.uk  \n \nKey headlines  \nElectricity demand decreased in 2023 to 316.8 TWh, down by 1.1 per cent from 2022 , to levels last seen \nin the 1980s . This was likely  driven by a continuation of 2022’s high prices and similarly high annual average \ntemperatures which reduced demand for heating. \nHigh  energy  and other  prices and high average temperatures led to the lowest domestic consumption \nsince 1990 , with industrial and commercial consumption also down . Domestic consumption fell 3.0 per \ncent to 92.6 TWh while industrial consumption was down 0.9 per cent and commercial consumption was down \n2.9 per cent.  \nElectricity generation fell by a tenth in 2023 as record electricity imports, lower UK demand and lower \nexport s compared to 2022 reduced the UK generation  needed to meet demand. Electricity generation fell \nto 292 .7 TWh, 9.9 per cent lower than 2022. The UK returned to being a net electricity importer  as total \nimports rose to a record 33.3 TWh  and total exports fell back  to 9.5 TWh, giving net imports of 23.8 TWh.  \nRenewable generation in 2023 was similar to 2022, narrowly reaching a record 135.8 TWh , 0.3 per cent \nhigher than 2022 . Wind generation rose 2.2 per cent to a record 82.3 TWh and solar generation rose 4.1 per \ncent to a record 13.9 TWh. This was driven by increases in wind and solar generation capacity  which offset \nslightly less favourable weather conditions. Bioenergy generation decreased 4.9 per cent  to 34.1 TWh , as \noutages continued at key bioenergy sites. \nFossil fuel generation decreased by a fifth in 2023 to 107.3 TWh . Gas  remained the largest single fuel , \nproviding 101.7 TWh of  generation. Coal generation continued to fall, down to a record low.  \nThe share of generation coming from low carbon sources rose to a record 60.3 per cent in 2023 , as \nstable renewable generation combined with lower overall generation.  The lower total generation also helped \nthe renewable generation share to a record 46.4 per cent , exceeding  the share from fossil fuels  (36.7 per cent)  \nfor the third  time in four years.  \nTotal de- rated generation capacity decreased to 74.8 GW in 2023 , 2.6 per cent low er than in 2022 . \nCapacity for renewable technologies increased by 4.0 per cent to 25 .6 GW , fossil fuel capacity decreased 6.8 \nper cent to 40.5 GW with the closures of three of the UK’s four remaining coal -fired power stations , Drax, West \nBurton and Kilroot . \n  \n2 \n Electricity demand reached a record low in 2023 of 316.8 TWh, down by 1.1 per cent from 2022  as high \nenergy prices and other costs, as well as warmer than usual tempe ratures , continued into 2023. Electricity \ndemand has declined year -on-year since 2015, apart from a slight increase between 2020 and 2021 as \ndemand recovered from  the effects of the Covid- 19 pandemic. In line with the decrease in demand, final \nconsumption fell by 1.2 per cent compared to 202 2. ‘Final consumption’ refers to electricity consumption by \nend users, excluding electricity consumed in the process of generation and transmission or distribution losses.  \nChart 5. 1 Electricity consumption by sector, 2000 to 202 3 (DUKES Table 5.1 ) \n \nContinued high prices and higher average temperatures led to the lowest  domestic consumption  since \n1990, with industrial consumption also decreasing. In 2023 , domestic consumption fell 3.0 per cent \ncompared to 2022 to 92.6 TWh  while industrial consumption was down 0.9 per cent. The low domestic \nconsumption followed continued higher energy and other prices alongside near record high temperatures . \nCommercial consumption fell  by 2.9 per cent in 2023 , with the moderate increase in commercial activity \noutweighed by continued high prices . Higher average temperatures continued from 2022, which reduced the \ndemand for electricity for heating. \nTotal electricity demand is larger than electricity consumption. This is because total demand also accounts for \nelectricity consumed in the process of generation or to produce fuel for generation, as well as for electricity lost \nin transmission or distribution from where it is generated to where it is consumed. The full breakdown of \nelectricity demand is shown below.  \n  \n\n3 \n Chart 5. 2 Share of total electricity demand split by sector, 2023 ( DUKES Table 5.2 ) \nDomestic users accounted for the largest share of total electricity demand ( 29.2 per cent), though this \nis 0.6 percentage points below the 2022 share ( 29.8 per cent).  Industrial consumption made up 27.2 per \ncent, increasing by 0. 1 percentage points on the previous year’s  share, while commercial consumption \naccounted for 19.3 per cent, down by 0.4 percentage points.  \nElectricity supply decreased 1.0 per cent in 202 3 in line with  lower demand for electricity . Electricity \ngeneration fell by 9.9 per cent, as  record electricity imports reduced the need for UK generation.  \nElectricity generation measures what is generated while electricity supply measures what was supplied to \nconsumers , excluding the electricity used in the process of generation or consumed on site by the generator. \nTotal electricity supplied plus imports matches  with demand as electricity is supplied until demand is met . \nDemand for electricity is usually met by UK generation and supplemented with imports from Europe when \nprice differentials are favourable. This differed in 2022 as outages in the French nuclear fleet meant that large \namounts of electricity were exported via the France- UK interconnectors, leading to the UK being a net \nexporter. This led to increased UK generation and supply, despite lower demand in the UK. Total electricity supplied in 2022 was 319 .6 TWh, with net exports of 5.3  TWh.   \nChart 5. 3 Electricity generated by fuel, 2000 to 2023 ( DUKES Table 5.6 ) \n\n4 \n Electricity generation fell to 292.7 TWh in 2023 , down  9.9 per cent compared to 2022.  This was due to \nlower  UK demand, increased electricity imports and lower demand for exports to Europe . Major Power \nProducers (MPPs) generated 237 .8 TWh, down 12 per cent compared to 2022, while generation from \nautogenerators and other generators i ncreased slightly , up 0.4 per cent to 54.9 TWh. The share of  generation \nfrom MPPs decreased  by 1.9 percentage points  to 81.2 per cent . \nRenewable generation in 2023 was broadly similar to 2022 , increasing 0.3 per cent to narrowly reach a \nnew record high of 135. 8 TWh, driven by  record high output from wind and solar generators.  For wind, \ncapacity increases offset slightly lower wind speeds lead ing to wind generation increasing 2 .2 per cent on \n2022 levels, to 82 .3 TWh. Solar capacity also increased and despite reduced average sun hours , solar \ngeneration r ose 4.1 per cent to 13. 9 TWh. Both wind and solar generation have increased rapidly  in recent \nyears . Compared to ten years ago,  wind generation in 2023 was nearly three times 2013’s value and s olar \ngeneration nearly seven times 2013 levels. Rainfall below the 20- year average in key hydro areas saw a 2.2 \nper cent drop  in generation. Outages at key bioen ergy sites caused a reduction in generation of 4.9 per cent to \n34.1 TWh.  \nFossil fuel generation decreased 19 .8 per cent in 2023 to 107.3 TWh , a level last seen in the mid -1950s \nwhen electricity demand was a third of today’s requirement and over 95 per cent fuelled by coal and \noil-fired  generation.  In 2023, m ost fossil fuel generation continued to come from gas, which fell 19 per cent to \n101.7 TWh. Coal generation continued to decrease, down 36 percent to a record low 3.8 TWh. Three of the \nUK’s four coal-fired power plants ceased operation in 2023 , with commitments in place to close the last , \nRatcliffe -on-Soar,  by October 2024.  \nNuclear generation fell 14 per cent to 4 0.6 TWh  in 2023.  Whilst the UK’s operational nuclear capacity \nremained unchanged, all nuclear plants experienced outages throughout 2023. These included outages for \nrefuelling as well as planned and unplanned maintenance.  \n \nAs well as absolute generation, it is also useful to consider the overall shares of generation, which are less \naffected by changes in demand. This allows trends in different fuels to be examined, including the share of electricity generated from low carbon sources. \nChart 5. 4 Shares of electricity generation by fuel, 2015 to 2023 ( DUKES Table 5.6 ) \n \nRenewable sources accounted for 46.4 per cent of generation in 202 3, exceeding the annual share of \ngeneration from fossil fuels for the third  time in the published data series.  The renewable share rose by \n4.7 percentage points compared to 2022 levels. Wind generation accounted for more than  a quarter of \ngeneration in 202 3, up 3.3 percentage points to a record 28.1 per cent share, while the share for solar  rose to \n\n5 \n a record 4.7 per cent.  Bioenergy increased 0.6 percentage points to an 11.6 per cent share . Hydro remained \nat similar levels to 2022, at 1.9 per cent share . \nThe share of generation from fossil fuels fell 4.5 percentage points to record low of 36.7 per cent, as \nfavourable weather conditions for renewables and increased imports reduced the need for fossil fuel \ngeneration.  Gas accounted for the vast majority of the fossil fuel share, standing at 34.7 per cent of total \ngeneration and down 3.8 percentage points on 2022 levels. The share of generation from coal reached a new \nlow of 1. 3 per cent as coal generation continued to decline.  \nNuclear generation accounted for 13.9 per cent of generation in 2023 , down 0. 7 percentage points on \n2022 levels and the lowest level since 2008. This reflects lower operational capacity , as two nuclear plants \nclosed in 2022, as well as outages . Despite the decrease in the share from nuclear, the share of generation \ncoming from low carbon sources  (nuclear plus renewables)  rose to 60.3 per cent in 202 3, the highest value on \nthe published data series and 4.0 percentage points higher than in 2022.  \nThe total fuel used for electricity generation de creased by 12.4 per cent in 2023 to 47.4 million tonnes \nof oil equivalent (Mtoe). This  was driven by a 9.9 per cent  fall in UK generation due to increased electricity \nimports. The decrease in fuel used  was greater than the drop in overall electricity generated due to growth in \nnon-thermal renewables which do not incur conversion losses1. Fuel used for electricity has fallen 3 7 per cent \nin the last ten years . \nTrends in fuel used broadly mirror those in electricity generation, with decreases in the amount of fossil fuel \nand nuclear fuel use, a small drop in bioenergy and increases in assumed fuel used by wind and solar generators. Gas continues to dominate the UK generation mix, with 17 .7 Mtoe used in 2023, while coal use \ndecreased to 0.9 Mtoe, the lowest value on the published data series. \n  \n \n \n1 For wind, hydro and solar,  in line with international reporting standards , pr imary  production of energy is  defined as \nextraction of energy products in a useable form from natural sources. For wind this is the electricity generated by the wind \nturbine. Therefore,  for these technologies , the fuel used is assumed the same as the electricity generated, unlike thermal \ngeneration where conversion losses are incurred. Therefore, for example, if one unit of electricity produced from coal is \nswitched to wind, the fuel used will show a fall from around three units (as coal's thermal efficiency is around one- third) to \none unit.  \n6 \n The UK returned to being a net electricity importer in 2023, with net imports totalling a record 23.8 \nTWh . Total imports recovered to a record 33 .3 TWh, more than double 2022 levels. Meanwhile total exports \nhalved compared to 202 2, reaching 9.5 TWh , but were still the second highest  annual figure . In 2022, the UK \nhad been a net exporter for the first time in more than 40 years, with net exports totalling 5.3 TWh.  The \nprimary reason for this atypical situation was the widespread outages in the French nuclear fleet, increasing \nthe demand for exported electricity to France.  \nWith price differentials returning to more usual patterns  in 2023, t he UK  was a net importer from all \ninterconnected countries except the Republic of Ireland, which is connected to the UK through land \nconnections from Northern Ireland and an interconnector cable from Wales. The France -UK interconnectors \naccounted for 12.9 TWh of net imports, followed by Norway -UK with 8.5 TWh of net imports. The \ninterconnectors with both France and Norway supplied record imports in 2023. The Belgium -UK interconnector \naccounted for 3.0 TWh of net imports and the Netherlands -UK interconnector 2.7 TWh . More electricity was \nexported to the Republic of Ireland than was imported  from there to the UK, leading to net exports  from the \nUK. The Ireland- Wales  interconnector saw net exports of 1.7 TWh and the Northern Ireland -Ireland \ninterconnector cont ributed 1.6 TWh of net exports to the total. The Denmark -UK interconnector commenced \noperation in the last full week of December. \nChart 5. 5 Electricity imports and exports by country, 2020  to 202 3 (DUKES Table 5.13 ) \n \n  \n\n7 \n UK electricity is generated from a range of technologies and fuels are used at different times in response to \ndemand and changes in weather. Monitoring capacity along with load factors (the proportion of potential \ngeneration that is realised in the year) can highlight how the capacity is being used to monitor the security of \nelectricity supply.  \nIn this section, wind, small scale hydro and solar PV capacity is de -rated to account for intermittency , \nto enable direct comparison with conventional fuels which are less dependent on the weather. Total installed \ncapacity figures (not de -rated) are available in DUKES Table 5.12 . \nChart 5. 6 De-rated capacity of UK electricity generation assets by fuel, 2010 to 20 23 (DUKES \nTable 5.7) \n \nTotal de- rated generation capacity d ecreased to 74.8 GW in 2023 , down 2.6 per cent compared to \n2022.  This was due to closures of two large coal -fired plants, Drax and West Burton . The reduction was partly \noffset by increases in offshore wind, solar and bioenergy capacity, as well as the opening of gas -fired Keadby \n2. Capacity for renewable technologies increased by 4.0 per cent to 25 .6 GW while fossil fuel capacity \ndecreased 6.8 per cent to 40.5 GW. The peak demand in winter was slightly down , by 0.7 per cent,  compared \nto the equivalent figure in 2022 at 48. 3 GW. As Major Power Producer (MPP) capacity fell by 3.1 per cent in \n2022, the peak represented 77.4 per cent of MPP capacity, 1.9 percentage points higher than 2022.  \nDe-rated renewable capacity increased 4.0 per cent, driven by increases in offshore wind and solar \ncapacity. Wind capacity increased by 4.9  per cent to 13.0 GW with a 3.9 per cent increase for onshore wind \nand a 5.9  per cent increase for offshore wind, including 0.5 GW at Seagreen. De-rated solar capacity also saw \nan increase of 10.8 per cent to 2. 8 GW. \nMajor Power Producers’ power plants were less  intensively deployed than they were last year, with a \nload factor of 39.2 per cent  (DUK ES Ta ble 5.10 ). Load f actors indicate the proportion of the time the plant is \nproducing electricity and decreased by 4.4 percentage points compared to 2022 , in line with reduced \ngeneration by Major Power Producers  due to increased electricity imports. Load factors vary by technology, \nwith nuclear stations the highest at 72. 4 per cent and the lowest being pumped storage hydro at 9.8 per cent. \nFull load factors for renewable generation are given in DUKES Table 6.3 .  \n\n8 \n \nMap of Major Power Producers in the UK (operational May 202 4) \n \n \n \n  \n9 \n UK Distribution Network Operating Areas and GB Power Lines Map \nTrade connections are representations of the route, not the actual locations.  \nData sour ces: National Grid Transmission Network ( www.nationalgrid.com/uk ); D ESNZ Distribution Network Operator \nData; DESNZ Country Boundary Data.  \n \n\n \n \n \n Electricity  Flow Chart 20 23 (TWh ) \n \nNote s on flow chart   \n\n  \n11 \n  \n  \n \n     \n \n      \n \n     \n \n \n \n© Crown copyright 2024 This publication is licensed under the terms of the Open Government Licence v3.0 except where otherwise stated.
