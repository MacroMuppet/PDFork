In 3) IPFM site feed\nJanuary 2022, U.S. nuclear weapon stockpile was estimated to include 5,044 warheads. Of these, W IPFM on Twitter\nabout 3,700 weapons are in active stockpile and about 1,300 weapons are awaiting f IPFM on Facebook\ndismantlement. The active stockpile includes 1,770 deployed warheads, assigned to strategic\nand non-strategic delivery systems, and an estimated 1,938 warheads in reserve.\nCOUNTRIES\nThe current stock of fissile materials in the United States is estimated to include 87.6 tonnes of ———\nplutonium and 483 tonnes of unirradiated highly-enriched uranium. The United States has no Russia\nseparated plutonium produced by a civilian program. United States\n. : . . : : United Kingdom\nThe United States is not producing fissile materials for weapons. Production of HEU for\nweapons ended in 1964. Additional HEU was produced for naval-reactor fuel through 1992. All France\nU.S. production reactors were shut down in 1987. China\nPakistan\nHighly-enriched uranium India\nIsrael\nThe United States has a HEU stockpile estimated to be about 483 tons as of the beginning of North Korea\n2023. In 2016 it declared that as of 30 September 2013 its HEU inventory was 585.6 tons, of\n. wae . . . Non-nuclear weapon states\nwhich 499.4 tons was declared to be for \"national security or non-national security programs\nincluding nuclear weapons, naval propulsion, nuclear energy, and science.\" This material was Countries\nestimated to include about 360.9 MT of HEU in weapons and available for weapons, 121.1\ntonnes of HEU reserved for naval fuel and 17.3 MT of HEU reserved for research reactors. The\nremaining 86.2 tonnes of the 2013 declaration was composed of 41.6 tonnes ‘available for FACILITIES\npotential down-blend to low enriched uranium or, if not possible, disposal as low-level waste’, Research reactors\nand 44.6 tonnes in spent reactor fuel. Naval reactors\nAs of the end of 2022, the amount available for use had been reduced to about 465.1 tonnes, Reprocessing plants\nwhich is estimated to include 89.5 tonnes of HEU in naval reserve and 14.6 tonnes reserved for Enrichment facilities\nresearch reactors. It is estimated that at the end of 2022 the amount of material to be Facilities\ndownblended had been reduced to 18 tonnes.\nSeparated plutonium MATERIALS\nPlutonium\nAccording to the most recent official plutonium balance, in 2009 the United States measured Highly enriched uranium\ninventory was 95.4 tons. According to U.S. INFICRC/549 declarations, since 2009 the United Materials\nel\nStates disposed of additional 0.4 tons of plutonium in WIPP and lost 0.2 tons to radioactive\ndecay. It also added 0.4 tons of research reactor plutonium transferred from abroad. Taking\ninto account that the plutonium stock includes 7.8 tons of irradiated plutonium, the amount of ABOUT IPEM\nseparated plutonium is 87.6 tons. oo\nAbout IPFM\nhttps:/Missilematerials.org/countries/united_states.html 2\n\n213/25, 4:38 AM United States - International Panel on Fissile Materials\nOf the total amount of 87.6 tons of unirradiated plutonium, 79.7 tons are considered military Members\nstock. Even though the United States reports 49.4 tons of separated unirradited plutonium in Staff\nits INFCIRC/549 declaration, most of this material is in weapons or weapon components or Contact\nother weapon-origin material that retains classified attributes. Some of this material (4.6 MT)\nis in unirradiated MOX fuel. While all this material is covered by a pledge not to use it for\nmilitary purposes, only 3 MT of separated plutonium is safeguarded. These are 3 tons of\nplutonium at the Savannah River Site that are placed under IAEA safeguards.\nAPRIL 13,2024 ¥ f %\nHome —_IPFM Blog Publications Library = About IPFM © Copyright 2024.\nPowered by Movable Type Pro\nhttps:/Missilematerials.org/countries/united_states.html 22\n\n",
