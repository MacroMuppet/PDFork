U.S. U30g\nproduction remained near historic lows despite operations resuming at the White Mesa Millc7, the United States’ only operating conventional uranium mill.\nUsing different processes, five facilities in the United States produced U3Qg in 2022. Despite only reporting production in the last three months of 2022, White Mesa accounted for\n84% of the U3Og produced last year, The rest was produced at four in situ recovery: facilities. White Mesa operates on a campaign basis; it only produces U3Og as when mill\nfeed, contract requirements, or market conditions warrant. It can also process other minerals, including rare earths. In 2021, White Mesa focused on ramping up rare earth\ncarbonate production and didn’t produce any U30g.\nProducing U3zO0g—often called yellowcake for its powdered, yellow appearance—is one of the first steps in making fuel for nuclear reactors c*. After uranium ore is mined, it goes\nthrough a milling process where uranium is extracted from the ore, producing U3Og, which is then processed at conversione’ and enrichment: facilities. The enriched uranium is\nmade into fuel pellets that are assembled into fuel rods for nuclear reactors.\nIn the 1940s and 1950s, the United States introduced financial incentives’, procurement programs, and trade policies 2 to help spur domestic uranium production. Domestic U30,\nproduction significantly declined in the 1980s as production incentives and subsidies ended, trade barriers were removed, and uranium prices fell. Since then, most of the uranium\nmaterial supplied to U.S, nuclear plants has been imported.\nThe uranium material used in U.S. nuclear power reactors is largely imported because it’s more abundant and cheaper to produce in other countries. In 2022, 95% of the uranium\npurchased by U.S. nuclear power plant operators originated in other countries. Canada, which has large, high-quality uranium reserves, was the largest source of uranium\npurchased by U.S. nuclear power plants in 2022 at 27%. Kazakhstan was the second-largest source at 25%, followed by Russia at 12%.\nAlthough the United States banned imports of oil, natural gas, and coalc’ from Russia following Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022, uranium was not\nsanctioned.\nThe U.S. Department of Energy has announced its aim to increase domestic uranium productione to reduce reliance on uranium imports. In 2020, Congress established a\nstrategic uranium reserve, a stockpile of domestically produced uranium that serves as backup supply for U.S. nuclear power plants and incentivizes domestic uranium\nproduction. At the end of 2022, the U.S. Department of Energy awarded the first UzOg supply contractsc7 for the reserve, including one to White Mesa’s operator, Energy Fuels.\nPrincipal contributors: Slade Johnson, Elesia Fasching\nhttps:/Awww.eia.govitodayinenergy/detail._php?id=60160. 4H\n\n",
