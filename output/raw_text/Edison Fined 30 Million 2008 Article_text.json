The decision also substantially reduced the\njudge’s refund order, cutting Edison’s total price tag from the fraud to $146 million\nfrom $200 million.\nConsumer advocate Mark Toney applauded the decision anyway, calling it “a real\nvictory for consumers.”\n“The fact that a commission that is so utility-friendly would impose this kind of a fine\non a utility is a real indication of how outrageous their conduct was,” said Toney,\nexecutive director of the Utility Reform Network, a San Francisco group that had\npushed for a higher penalty.\nThe unanimous vote puts an end to a scandal that came to light in 2004, a year after\nEdison received its first whistle-blower letter describing how employees were gaming\ncustomer-satisfaction surveys to help the company and managers win bonuses and\nratepayer-funded incentives.\nEdison’s internal investigations confirmed those allegations and found that managers\nsubmitted falsified first aid and injury data to win bonuses for worker safety. At the\nEdison-run San Onofre Nuclear Generating Station, the probe found that managers\nsuppressed injury reporting by asking employees to treat themselves and by\npressuring doctors to alter records or use Steri-Strips in lieu of stitches.\n“The severity of SCE’s violations was considerable. . .. Management knew, or should\nhave known, that these violations were occurring,” said Commissioner Rachelle\nChong, author of Thursday’s decision. “It took two whistle-blower letters to finally get\nthe attention of senior management to successfully investigate these inappropriate\npractices,”\nThose and other considerations “justify a significant fine in this case,” Chong said.\nEdison, a subsidiary of Rosemead-based Edison International, said it “agrees with the\nCalifornia Public Utilities Commission that the reporting inaccuracies the utility\ndiscovered, investigated and self-reported to regulators represented a very serious\nbreach of SCE’s responsibility.”\nSpokesman Gil Alexander said Edison had no further comment. The company has 30\ndays to seek a rehearing, but it is limited to asserting legal error, PUC spokeswoman\nTerrie Prosper said.\nhttps:/Avww.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-2008-sep-19-fi-edison 19-story.html 43\n\n2/14/25, 4:52 PM Edison fined $30 millon for fraud - Los Angeles Times\nADVERTISEMENT\nEdison had argued that the penalties should be limited because it quickly and\nvoluntarily reported the problems, conducted extensive investigations and offered to\nreturn more money than it thought was warranted. Edison offered to pay a $2.5-\nmillion fine and refund more than $49 million.\nChong and others praised Edison’s cooperation in the case, adding that the fine\nwould have been substantially higher -- as much as $102 million -- if the utility had\nnot provided that assistance.\nThe fraud case grew out of a commission program to reward utilities with ratepayer-\nfunded incentives for good performance in customer service, employee safety and\nother areas -- and to penalize them for poor performance.\nEdison won the maximum rewards for customer satisfaction from 1997 through 2003\nbased on high scores on surveys conducted by an outside firm. Those results,\nhowever, were rigged by planners under intense pressure to get good scores despite\nbeing chronically understaffed amid a surging workload.\nTo help the company and managers win the bonuses anyway, employees were\nencouraged by managers and others to erase or change the phone numbers of\nunhappy customers to prevent customer satisfaction surveyors from reaching them.\nAt times, planners substituted the phone numbers of relatives or of customers who\ncould be counted on to give glowing assessments of the company’s work.\nUnder Thursday’s decision, Edison must pay the $30-million fine into the state’s\ngeneral fund within 30 days. In addition, the company must submit a plan within 30\ndays that describes whether the $81 million in refunds will be given in the form of bill\ncredits for the utility’s 4.8 million customers or be taken out of future rates.\nAlso Thursday, the PUC approved what it called a groundbreaking energy-efficiency\nstrategic plan covering 2009 through 2020. The plan lays out goals that would: by\n2020, make all new residential construction “zero net energy,” where electricity\nproduced on site or by nearby renewable sources meets the entire energy needs of the\nhome; by 2030, make all new commercial construction zero net energy; by 2020,\nmake all eligible low-income homes energy efficient; and make efficiency gains in\nheating, ventilation and air-conditioning systems.\nelizabeth.douglass@latimes.com\nMore to Read\nhttps:/wwwlatimes.com/archives/la-xprn-2008-sep-10-fi-edison19-story.htmt 213\n\n2114/28, 4:52 PM Edison fined $30 millon for fraud - Los Angeles Times.\nState officials approve Edison rate hike for 2017 wildfire oe\nsparked by its equipment eee tan\naps\nEdison wants to raise rates to pay for wildfires linked to its A Re Te\nequipment pes oa\nJan. 29, 2025 pare eer\nPreemptive power shutoffs that have gone on for days draw raw =\ncomplaints from Inland Empire residents, politicians Red EA pa Sea\nJan. 25, 2025 pes i So\nBeene\n—oooCooyyoyyyyyyyyylylylylyyyy==>=>=>=>=>>>>>>>>>>>=>=>==>==>=[{[{_{[{__=_={=[{[{__={==_=_—as—[S=_={=[=[_S{={[{_[_\"a==———====5\nCopyright © 2025, Los Angeles Times | Terms of Service | Privacy Policy | CA Notice of Collection | Do Not Sell or Share My Personal Information\nhttps:/fwew.latimes.com/archivesila-xpm-2008-sep~19-fi-edison19-story.htmt 38\n\n",
