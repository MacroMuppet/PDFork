Of the 1.55 tons, ap-\nproximately 96 kg of uranium-233 may be unaccounted for. There are also varying\nsite-specific estimates suggesting that material control and accountability of the US.\nuranium-233 inventory needs to be more stringent. About 428 kg of uranium-233 is\nstored at the Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL), in Tennessee at Building 3019, a\n69-year-old structure which DOE describes as the “oldest operating nuclear facility in\nthe World” and one that does not meet current safeguards and security requirements.\n\nCurrently, the U.S. Department of Energy’s (DOE) goal for disposition of the 428 kg\nis 2018, more than 20 years after significant environmental, safety, and security vul-\nnerabilities were first officially acknowledged.

The paper con-\ncludes with a discussion of the uranium-233 legacy and the shortcomings of\nDOE’s current waste disposition plans\nTHE URANIUM-233 INVENTORY\nFrom the 1940s until the mid to late 1950s, uranium-233 was produced in\nsmall quantities in the United States for weapons research and development\n(R&D). In 1955 the first uranium-233 nuclear device with a yield of 22 kilo-\ntons was detonated at the Nevada Atomic Proving Grounds.’ According to one\nU.S. nuclear weapons laboratory official, “uranium-233 has been shown to be\nhighly satisfactory as a weapons material. By 1954, however, DOE’s prede-\ncessor, the Atomic Energy Commission (AEC) had conducted a comprehensive\nstudy but did not pursue uranium-233 production for weapons use. A major\nfactor was the radiation hazard from uranium-232 which is co-produced when\nirradiating thorium. “The gamma radiation associated with the uranium-232\nchain” stated an expert at the AEC’s Hanford site “is the major complication\nin the fabrication and utilization of uranium-233.”5\n\nIn the early 1960s, there was renewed interest in using uranium-233 in\nnuclear weapons after “it was discovered that the plutonium components in\nthe strategic warheads in stockpile were susceptible to serious damage when\nsubjected to neutron irradiation induced fissions in space from nuclear-armed\ninterceptor missiles in ‘near-hit situations’ within a ten mile radius.” Because\nuranium-233 is more stable at high temperatures than plutonium, it raised\nthe possibility that uranium-233 warheads would be more robust.®\n\nThis prompted the AEC nuclear production sites to develop techniques\nto produce “clean” uranium-233, with less than 5 ppm of uranium-282 to re-\nduce radiation hazards. To achieve this goal, measures were proposed at the\nHanford site, in which: (1) thorium obtained from pure monazites ore low in the\nthorium-230 isotope would be irradiated; (2) the material would be irradiated\nin neutron flux relative free of neutrons above 6 MeV, requiring a specially\nmoderated reactor; and (3) irradiation of the thorium would be halted while\n\nManaging the U.S. Uranium-233 Stockpile 55\nit still held protactinium-233 (27-day half-life) that could be separated from\nuranium-232 before it decayed to uranium-233,\"\n\nBy 1966, interest in large-scale production of uranium-233 for weapons use\nhad waned but production for R&D continued. A review of the history of the\nDOE's Rocky Flats Plant, in Colorado, which manufactured weapons compo-\nnents, found that uranium-288 was being fabricated from 1965 until the early\n1980s.3 From 1955 to 1968, several nuclear weapons tests were conducted us-\ning wranium-233.\n\nUranium-233 was produced in more substantial amounts from 1965 to\n1970 with the expectation that it could fuel power reactors. Developing\nuranium-233 as a potential fuel required the construction and operation of\nthorium fuel cycle R&D facilities, research reactors, radiochemical separations\nfacilities, hot-cells, fuel fabrication facilities, and the storage of spent commer-\ncial reactor thorium fuel by DOE and its predecessor agencies.\n\nBetween 1954 and 1970 uranium-233 was produced in weapons material\nproduction reactors at the Savannah River Site (SRS) in South Carolina, the\nHanford site in Washington, and in several commercial nuclear power plants\n(Indian Point I, Dresden I, Peach Bottom I, and Fort St. Vrain). Approximately\ntwo tons of uranium-233 was produced, of which 1556 kg was separated from\n857 tons of thorium at reprocessing plants (Table 1), at an estimated total cost\nof $5.5 to $11 billion (2012 dollars) including associated cleanup costs.!° About\n655 kg of separated uranium-233 subsequently fueled DOE research reactors\nand/or was lost to waste.!! About 403 kg of wranium-233 was generated in\ncommercial nuclear power and government reactors, but not reprocessed.”\n\nAs of 1999, approximately 805 kg of separated uranium 233 was stored\nat DOE sites.” This leaves a discrepancy of approximately 96 kilograms or 6\npercent of the total amount recovered from reprocessing plants. By compari-\nson, the DOE’s official inventory difference for plutonium published in 1996 is\n2.1 percent.!4\nUranium 233 as Power Reactor Fuel\n\nIn the 1960s and early 1970s the AEC assumed that 1000 GWe of nu-\nclear capacity would be online inside the United States by the year 2000, with\na similar nuclear capacity outside. As a result, the AEC predicted that world\nuranium supplies would be rapidly exhausted. These assumptions drove a two-\ntrack R&D effort for a new generation of reactors that would he capable of pro-\nducing more fissile material than they consumed. As it turned out, the AEC’s\nprediction of the year-2000 global nuclear capacity was off by an order of mag-\nnitude,\n\nThe first track was the development of fast-neutron reactors. “Fast”\nfission releases more neutrons per fission than the thermal neutron fission in\n\n56 Alvarez\nTable 1: Summary of Thorium—Uranium-233 Processing in the United States\nLS\nThorium = Urainiumn-233 Uranium-232\nProcessed Recovered Content Flowsheet\nSite Date (year) <tons) kg) (ppm U) Employed\nOak Ridge 1954-1958 35 55 10-40 Interim 23\nNational Thorex\nLaboratory!\nSavannah 1964-1969 240 580 3.9-228 Interim 23\nRiver Plant?

Plutonium-fueled fast-reactors in particular held the\npromise of producing electricity and 30 percent more fuel than they consumed.\n\nThe second track was the development of thorium based slow-neutron re-\nactors. This led to the production of significant quantities of uranium-233 for\nreactor fuel. The attractiveness of the thorium fuel cycle was due to the abun-\ndant supply of thorium in nature and the potential of uranium-233 to increase\nthe efficiency of fissile material production in slow-neutron reactors relative to\nuranium-235 and plutonium. For example, although current light water reac-\ntors generate plutonium-239, only about 0.6 atoms are produced per fission of\nuranium-235 or plutonium-239 (a conversion ratio of ~0.6). For thorium the\nconversion ratio can be greater than one, holding the promise that such a re-\nactor can produce more fissile material than it destroys.\n\nR&D of several reactor types was launched with the goal of demonstrat-\ning that uranium-233 derived from thorium would be a safe and economical\nsource of electricity. Projects demonstrating the potential viability of slow-\nneutron breeder reactors using uranium-233 were established, most notably\nthe Elk River Reactor in Minnesota, the Molten Salt Reactor at ORNL, and\nthe Light Water Breeder Reactor at Shippingport, Pennsylvania. By 1977,\nhowever, pursuit of the thorium fuel cycle was effectively abandoned in favor\n\nManaging the U.S. Uranium-233 Stockpile 57\nof plutonium-fueled fast-reactors. All told the AEC and its successor the DOE\nspent billions of dollars on thorium fuel cycle R&D.\n\nAnother factor that may have influenced the decision to abandon the tho-\nrium fuel cycle is that thorium is more radioactive than uranium and requires\nadditional safeguards. The surface dose rate from a 55 gallon drum of thorium\noxide is approximately 60 mR/hr, about 13 times higher than a similar sized\ndrum of uranium,!® A worker spending time inside a thorium storage facility\ncould expect to encounter dose rates of 60-100 mEvhr, reaching the U.S. occu-\npational exposure limit of 5 rem in just over 6 days.\n\nAfter several failed attempts to establish a thorium fuel cycle, the com-\nmercial nuclear industry also walked away from thorium. The first commer-\ncial nuclear plant to utilize thorium was Indian Point Unit I, a pressurized\nwater reactor that began operation in 1962. However, the cost of recovering\nuranium-233 from this reactor was described as a “financial disaster.”!” Less\nthan one percent of the irradiated thorium was converted to uranium-2331%\nand the utility switched to uranium fuel. According to an official involved in\nthe AEC’s uranium-233 production program in 1968, “There is no anticipated\nuse for [the Indian Point] ... material so it will be stored semi-permanently ina\n5,000-gallon tank . ,.”!° Between 1979 and 1985, this material was solidified at\nORNL for safety reasons.2° Known as the Consolidated Edison Uranium Solid-\nification Project (CEUSP) material, it is approximately 86 per cent enriched.2!\nIt contains 796.3 kg of uranium-235 and 101.1 kg of uranium-233 in a total\nuranium content of 1042 kg.\n\nThe Peach Bottom I Unit, a prototype 40 megawatt high-temperature gas-\ncooled reactor used thorium fuel. It operated from 1967 to 1974. The reactor\nwas closed after experiencing a high rate of fuel element failures, causing sig-\nnificant down-time.”? Its spent fuel is currently stored at DOE’s Idaho National\nEngineering Laboratory (INEL).2\n\nThe Fort St. Vrain plant, operating from 1979 to 1989, was a high-\ntemperature-gas-cooled 330 megawatt reactor using thorium and uranium-235\nfuels. Hundreds of events involving equipment failure, gas leaks, fuel failures,\ncracked piping and graphite, and human error led to its closure.2* DOE is re-\nsponsible for its spent fuel which is stored in dry casks at the reactor site.”5\n\nIn June 2000, after lobbying by ORNL, the Secretary of Energy directed\nthe Office of Nuclear Energy to utilize the stockpile of excess uranium-233\nto increase the supply of medical isotopes. This was a multi-step process in\ndifferent locations requiring new facilities to extract thorium-229, an 8,000-\nyear half-life decay product of 160,000-year half-life uranium-233, which then\ndecays into actinium-225 (10-day half-life), and subsequently decays, through\nshort-lived intermediates, into bismuth-213 (46 minute halflife), a radioiso-\ntope of potential interest for medical therapy.”® In January 2001, the DOE de-\ntermined, however, that other than medical purposes, there was no program-\nmatic use for the uranium-283 stored at ORNL.?” In 2005, the U.S. Congress\n\n58 Alvarez\nterminated medical isotope production from the ORNL inventory and trans-\nferred the responsibility for its disposition to the Office of Environmental\nManagement (EM).”* That year, Congress also directed the U.S. Defense De-\npartment to dispose of 3,222 tons of thorium in the US. strategic material\nstockpile?\nSAFEGUARDS AND SECURITY\nSeparated uranium-233 is classified by the US. government as a Category I\nstrategic special nuclear material, i.e., material that “in specified forms and\nquantities, can be used to construct an improvised nuclear device capable of\nproducing a nuclear explosion.”** The United States and the International\nAtomic Energy Agency (IAEA) require safeguards for uranium-233 in quan-\ntities greater than 2 Kg.*! A Category I quantity of highly enriched uranium\n(HEU) is 5 kg. According to DOK, stringent physical security is required for\nuranium-233 stocks, in order to prevent “an unauthorized opportunity to ini-\ntiate or credibly threaten to initiate a nuclear dispersal or detonation ... for\nonsite assembly of an improvised nuclear device.”2”\n\nInterest waned for weapons use of uranium-233 due to it radiological haz-\nards, and the related costs of safeguarding the materials and protecting worker\nsafety. Of particular concern is exposure to uranium-232, which is co-produced\nand is 60 million times more radioactive than uranium-238. This is due to the\nshort half-life of U-232 and the high-energy gamma radiation emitted in the\ndecay scheme of uranium-232 daughter products, most notably thallium-208,\nwhich emits a 2.6 MeV gamma ray when it decays. This gamma radiation is dif-\nficult to shield. With a half-life of 72 years, the decay of uranium-232 increases\nexternal penetrating (gamma) radiation levels, which peak after 10 years\n(Figure 1).\n\nThe CEUSP material in Building 3019 was packaged over 25 years ago and\ncontains the highest concentration of fissile material (uranium-233/235) in the\nfacility—approximately 86 percent of the total uranium content.\n\nThe uranium-232 contaminant level, however, is not considered an ade-\nquate barrier to prevent a terrorist from making an improvised nuclear device.\nAccording to researchers at ORNL, “... ifa diverter was motivated by foreign\nnationalistic purposes, personnel exposure would be of no concerns since expo-\nsure even that these levels would not result in immediate death.” Uranium-\n233 currently stored at DOE sites typically contains from 6 to 162 parts per\nmillion of uranium-232, making it vulnerable to seizure by terrorists.*4 This\nis underscored by the DOER’s experience with handling wranium-232 contami-\nnant levels to make weapons components that were comparable to those being\nstored in Building 3019 at ORNL. For instance, during the 1960s and 1970s the\nDOE’s Rocky Flats Plant processed uranium-233 in uranyl nitrate and then\n\nManaging the U.S. Uranium-233 Siockpile 59\n\ngE, 405-: of ‘\n# ‘ S\nSoe\nBS t : ivesiev) ,\n@ 6 P82 wn 1220 RG a 2087) :2' 208 fp *N E\n3 hye 72yedi) E888) _=Sminy (Stebley fs\nb. y Buna itor |\na4 : (Tig 460,000yeara) (Stabe)\nE ol z te\n\n20.01 1.0. 100 40,600; 1,000,000\n\n‘Time (years):\nFigure 1: Gamma exposure rate for uranium-233 (ORNL/ TM-13653).\n\nfabricated uranium-233 metal components in kilogram quantities. According\nto a DOE report about handling uranium-233 at Rocky Flats:\n\nThe material also contained approximately 50 parts per million (ppm) con-\ntaminant.... A 50 ppm U-232 content equates to approximately 13 R/hr at 1 foot\nand with extrapolation, a 5 to 10 ppm content would emit approximately 5 R/hr\n[at 1 foot].3\n\nUnder this circumstance, it would take about one to two weeks of exposure,\nworking 12 hours-a-day, before a person would accumulate a potentially lethal\ndose.\n\nManaging the Uranium-233 Legacy\n\nThe lack of an accurate uranium-233 inventory has raised concerns. In\n1996, the U.S. DOE’s Inspector General (IG) issued an audit report that\nconcluded: “management at three sites [ORNL, Rocky Flats and the Idaho\nNational Laboratory] had not performed all required physical inventories, and.\none site did not perform measurements, due to safety concerns and opera-\ntional interruptions ... the longer complete physical inventories are delayed,\nthe greater the risk that unauthorized movement of special nuclear materials\ncould occur and go undetected.”*°\n\n60 Alvarez\n\nIn the years following the IG’s audit, DOE has reported varying estimates\nof the inventory at Oak Ridge and Idaho. For instance, published sources for\nuranium-238 stored in Building 3019 at ORNL range from 359 kg*” to 450 kg,5*\nan uncertainty of 91 kg. At DOE’s Idaho National Laboratory, inventory data of\nun-irradiated uranium-233 range from 352 kg®? to 411.36 ke*°, an uncertainty\nof 59.36 kg.\n\nIt is possible that more uranium-233 was lost to waste than publically re-\nported or is in diluted forms. Also the quantity at the Los Alamos National Lab-\noratory (LANL) in 1997 and the amount of uranium-233 used in weapons tests\nremains classified. According to the DOE, prior to 1970, when all uranium-233\nwas produced, material measurement technologies “were less accurate than\ntoday.”\n\nThere are 1,100 containers with uranium-233 stored in Building 3019.\nIt is also eligible for listing in the National Register of Historic Places.’ DOE\nfinds that this facility has “deteriorated beyond cost-effective repair. Signifi-\ncant annual costs would be incurred to satisfy current DOE storage standards,\nand to provide continued protection against potential nuclear criticality acci-\ndents or theft of the material.”\n\nSurface dose rates from the Building 3019 canisters range between 1 to\n300 R per hour,*# About 500 canisters are holding what is considered “high\npurity” material (~197 kg) that contains less than 50 ppm uranium-232.%\nBuilding 3019, which holds approximately 1,000 kilograms of uranium-233\nand uranium-235 does not meet current Category I security requirements. For\nexample, a batch of material that came from the Indian Point I reactor is co-\nmingled with nearly eight times more uranium-235 (796 kg) in HEU, another\nCategory I fissile material.*° Nor does it meet physical security requirements\nof the IAEA, which includes intrusion surveillance and motion detection.47\n\nIn 1976, after the DOE abandoned development of the thorium nuclear\nfuel cycle, efforts were made to stabilize some of the excess uranium-233 at\nORNL. Other than that, the US stockpile of excess uranium-233 was subject to\ndecades of neglect. In December 1996, the DOE's Office of Environment, Safety\nand Health conducted a vulnerability assessment of the storage of HEU at its\nsites. It found that inventories of separated uranium-233 at several sites were\nbeing stored in conditions that increased environmental, safety, and health\nrisks, According to the assessment:\n\nSome of the significant ES&H vulnerabilities involve uranium-233.... Four-\nteen vulnerabilities involving uranium-233 were identified. Four of these are\namong the most significant found in the assessment. Uranium-233 has been\nstored in metal containers, outside on pads, buried in drums in earthen mounds,\nor stored for decades without inspection.\n\nOf particular concern were the inventories at ORNL Building 3019, con-\nstructed in 1943, and holding 1,100 “cans” of uranium-233 (Figure 2).

In the early 1990s it was designated as DOE’s “na-\ntional repository for uranium-233” and contains material from SRS, ORNL,\nRocky Flats, Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory, and LANL in the form\nof oxides and metals.\n\nThree years earlier in 1993, a DOE review of Building 3019 found the\nsafety documentation to be “adequate.”“? The 1996 DOE vulnerability assess-\nment found that despite the facility’s nuclear safety paper-work, an environ-\nmental release from the containers “could be expected to occur within the next\nfive years in that some of the packages are approaching 30 years of age and\nhave not been regularly inspected.” 5°\n\nConcurrently, the DOE’s Defense Nuclear Facilities Safety Board (DNFSB)\nissued a critical report about the safety of the DOE’s uranium-233 inventory\nhighlighting the problems in Building 3019.\" As a result, in 1997 the Board\nissued a recommendation that urged the DOE to establish an agency-wide\nproject te correct storage vulnerabilities. Building 3019 at ONRL had among\nthe most significant vulnerabilities.\n\nThe risks at Building 3019 include natural events (earthquakes, tornados)\nfires, explosions and nuclear criticalities. Consequences from possible fires,\nexplosions, and other container failures holding uranium-233/235 recovered\nfrom Indian Point I reactor fuel (CEUSP material) are estimated to result in\n\n62 Alvarez\n\npotential offsite doses of 45 rems at a distance of nearly 6 miles,>* 450 times\n\nthe annual public exposure limit at DOE sites.*4 It took eleven years before the\n\nDNFSB closed its recommendation.® Yet the conditions of the building have\n\ndeteriorated, while contractor management and costs continue to escalate.5®\n\nA major reason the project is considered low priority is that DOE self-\nregulates and considers the effort to process and dispose of this material an\n“unfunded mandate” not linked to established program activities including\nenvironmental compliance agreements. Although the DNFSB can issue rec-\nommendations it does not have regulatory authority to establish deadlines or\nissue fines and penalties.\n\nIn November 2005, after fits and starts, EM assumed control of the project\nto downblend and dispose of the uranium-233. Nearly five years later, DOE’s\nIG reported that, “the Department’s uranium-233 disposition project had en-\ncountered a number of design delays, may exceed original cost estimates, and\nwill likely not meet completion milestones.” Since EM took over this project, it\nwas directed by four DOE managers in less than two years and the estimated\ntotal cost of the project increased from $384 million to $473 million.5”\n\nIn 2009, in an effort to reduce costs, DOE developed a plan for uranium-233\ndisposition °° in which:\n\ne CEUSP material (403 canisters and 73 percent of the fissile inven-\ntory in Building 3019) would be directly disposed in a landfill at the\nNevada National Security Site (NNSS).?\n\n« The DOE’s National Nuclear Security Agency would assume responsibility\nfor approximately 245 kg of uranium-283 oxide contained in Zero Power\nReactor fuel plates left over from the Molten Salt Reactor Experiment and\ntransfer it to the high-security Device Assembly Facility (DAF) at NNSS.\n\ne The remaining uranium-233 with uranium-238 oxides would be down-\nblended using existing hot cells at ORNL or with aqueous downblend-\ning followed by co-processing with radioactive waste sludges stored at the\nORNL site.\n\nIn January 2012, DOE announced it had shipped six canisters contain-\ning the Zero Power Reactor plates to the DAF at the NSSS for use in experi-\nments.® Shipment of the remaining 122 plates containing uranium-233 were\ncompleted by the end of June 2012.°! The goal for final removal and disposition\nof the balance of material in Building 3019 is projected for 2018.57\n\nDOE appears set on the direct disposal option for the CEUSP material in\na land fill, even though it would significantly violate its own safeguard and\nsecurity requirements® and NNSS Waste Acceptance Criteria (WAC)® (Fig-\nures 2 and 3). DOE argues that the CEUSP material would be placed in slit\ntrenches, up to 40 feet deep and then covered with low-level radioactive waste\n\nManaging the U.S. Uranium-233 Siockpile 63\n“1860. —_e [\n3000: a :\n500.\na ZaA|S;\nNNSS WAC” > ,\nfor U255 CEUSP,U-235;\nContent.“\n(per Canister),\nFigure 3: Disposal of CEUSP material exceeds DOE's Waste Acceptance Criterla for landfill\ndisposal of fissile materials,\nto serve as an additional barrier to prevent intrusion.®° However, uranium-\n233 and uranium-235 have half-lives of 160,000 years and 7044 million years\nrespectively. The National Research Council concluded in 2001 that “DOE’s\npreferred solutions—reliance on engineered barrier and institutional controls\nare inherently failure prone.”®§ The bigger issue may be that weapons-usable\nuranium-235, which serves as a diluent for the uranium-233, is going into a\nland disposal site without security.6” DOE is currently reviewing the potential\nfor an intruder obtaining the CEUSP material after it is disposed.\n\nThe contents in the CEUSP canisters are Category I material and meet\nthe criteria for “high-grade material.” For high-grade material, DOE requires\nsafeguards for quantities of uranium-233 greater than 2 kg and quantities of\nuranium-235 greater than 20 kg. In order to dispose of this material, the DOE\nwill have to grant an unprecedented termination of safeguard requirements.\n\nThe uranium-233 inventory of 323 kg at INEL was diluted in 31 tons of\nunirradiated thorium (1 percent dilution) and shipped to the NNSS beginning\nin 2010, where it was disposed as low-level radioactive wastes.”\n\nAccording to the NNSS WAC, uranium-235 disposal is limited to no more\nthan 350 grams per package. The CEUSP material in Building 3018 at has\nan average of 2,000 grams of uranium-235 and about 250 grams of uranium-\n233 per package. The NNSS WAC is silent about uranium-233 but uranium-\n233 has a critical mass much less than uranium-235. The DOE has not re-\nvealed how it will reconcile this. Meanwhile, over the past fifteen years DOE\nhas spent approximately $84 million on the surveillance of the uranium-233\npackages at ORNL.” These costs are expected to inerease as Building 3019\ndeteriorates. Since the CEUSP material is highly radioactive and was repro-\ncessed from spent fuel, it could arguably be considered high-level radioactive\nwaste (requiring geologic disposal), as defined in the Nuclear Waste Policy\nAct of 1982,” Other than the fissile material in ORNLs Building 3019, DOE\nhas pursued a policy of ultimate geologic disposal for excess weapons-usable\nfissile materials by blending down HEU and developing mixed oxide fuel or\n\n64 Alvarez\n\ndirect disposal of diluted plutonium in the Waste Isolation Pilot Project (WIPP)\na geologic disposal site in New Mexico. In 1998 the DOE approved termina-\ntion of safeguards for residues bearing plutonium for disposal at the WIPP.\nTermination was granted under the condition that the residues would he\ndownblended to “below 10 weight percent plutonium and placing the blended\nresidues in the pipe overpack containers prior to removing the residues from\nthe protected area.”\n\nDOE plans to complete shipment of the CEUSP material for land-fill dis-\nposal by August 2014.” If a variance terminating safeguards for the CEUSP\nmaterial is implemented, its fissile concentration would be more than eight\ntimes greater than allowed for the Rocky Flats material. Moreover the radi-\nation barrier created by contamination from uranium-232 will diminish by\n50 percent in less than 50 years, allowing for much easier access to the ma-\nterial for use in weapons.\n\nCONCLUSION\n\nThe storage of the U.S. stockpile of uranium-233 is a safeguard, security, and\nsafety risk and the production of the stockpile has left a disposal burden. The\nkey concerns are: uranium-233 inventory problems (with possibly 123 kg un-\naccounted for in the DOE complex); inadequate protection of weapons-grade\nmaterial; environmental, safety and health risks; the liability for management\nand disposal of spent thorium fuel from several commercial reactors; and dis-\nposal of uranium-233, including in landfill. Put simply, to save a few bucks the\nUnited States has decided no guns, gates, or guards for a lot of bombs worth of\nfissile material.”\n\nNuclear material control and accountancy of uranium-233 is a key element\nin assuring the adequate safeguard and security of this fissile material. The\nDOE should provide a more accurate inventory. Disposal of large quantities\nof concentrated uranium-233 waste in a land fill would significantly violate\nthe DOE’s safeguard and security requirements and NNNS Site WAC. In or-\nder to dispose of this material the DOE will have to grant an unprecedented\ntermination of safeguard requirements, which would be unwise since it would\nset a bad precedent for safeguarding and disposal of other wastes containing\nsignificant amounts of fissile materials. A policy that allows for the permanent\nshallow land disposal of 897.3 kilograms of concentrated nuclear explosive ma-\nterial places the United States in an impossible position to criticize the nuclear\nmaterials security of other countries.\n\nNOTES AND REFERENCES\n\n1.

U.S. Department of Energy, Defense Nuclear Facility Safety Board, Letter to The\nHonorable Samuel W. Bodman, Secretary of Energy, from A.J. Eggenberger, Chairman,\nApril 29, 2008.\n56. It has been argued that Building 3019 remains robust because of overly conser-\nvative engineering during World War II, when it was constructed and used as a jus-\ntification for it as a viable storage location for the uranium-233 stockpile. When DOE\nperformed its HEU vulnerability assessment in 1996 the facility was in a state of se-\nrious deterioration and disrepair by 1996. The author helped oversee this assessment.\nWhile shielding may have been thicker than the current design basis, this does not com-\npensate for the deterioration of the electrical distribution, material packaging, roofing,\npiping, and ventilation systems resulting from decades of deferred maintenance, 3019\nwas selected as the storage site not because of its robust construction but because it\nwas the main R&D hub for thorium, particularly the thermal-neutron reactor breeder\nprogram.\n57.
