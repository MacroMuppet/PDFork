Such updates have been published in what are commonly known as the “Red  Books”.  \nThis 29\nth edition features a comprehensive assessment of uranium supply and demand and \nprojections through the year 2040. The basis of this assessment is a comparison of uranium resource estimates (according to categories of geological certainty and production cost) and mine \nproduction capability with anticipated uranium requirements arising from projected installed \nnuclear capacity. Current data o n resources, exploration, production and uranium stocks are also \npresented, along with historical summaries of exploration and production, and plans for future \nmine development. Individual country reports offer detailed information on recent developments \nin uranium exploration and production, on environmental activities, regulatory requirements and \non relevant national uranium policies.  \nThis publication has been prepared on the basis of data obtained through questionnaires sent \nby the NEA to OECD member cou ntries and by the IAEA to other countries. It contains official data \nprovided by 36 countries and 18 national reports prepared by the secretariats of the NEA and the \nIAEA. This report is published under the responsibility of the OECD Secretary -General.  \nAcknowledgements  \nThis joint report was prepared by the NEA and IAEA Secretariats. The contributions from across \nthe two agencies were led by Mark Mihalasky at the IAEA, and Franco Michel -Sendis and Luminita \nGrancea at the NEA. The NEA and the IAEA gratefully acknowledge the attentive support provided by members of the Joint NEA/IAEA Uranium Group, as well as the co -operation of those \norganisations and individuals listed in Appendix 1 that replied to the Red Book 2021 questionnaire. \nIn compiling and preparing C hapters 1 and 3, the IAEA Secretariat highlights the collective efforts \nof Jean René Blaise (Consultant, France), Alexander Boytsov (TENEX, Russian Federation), \nLuis López (National Atomic Energy Commission, Argentina), James Marlatt (GeoTotal Group Ltd., \nCanada), Ji ří Mužák (DIAMO State Enterprise, Czech Republic), and Robert Vance (Consultant, \nCanada).

It \ncontains 54 country reports on uranium exploration, resources, production and reactor -related \nrequirements, 36 of which were prepared from officially reported government data and \nnarratives, and 18 that were prepared by the secretariats of the Nuclear Energy Agency (NEA) \nand International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA). The report includes projections for nuclear \ngenerating capacit y and reactor -related uranium requirements through 2040, as well as a \ndiscussion of long -term uranium supply and demand issues.  \nThe data reporting period for this edition of the so -called “Red Book” covers 1 January 2019 \nto 1 January 2021, although some r elevant information for 2021 and 2022 is also included in the \ndiscussions.  \nResources  \nOverall, g lobal uranium resources decreased modestly in the reporting period, in contrast to the slight \nincreases registered in previous recent editions of the “Red Book”. Total identified recoverable resources \ndecreased by nearly 2% from 2019, most notably in lower  cost recoverable resources. The most significant \ndecreases occurred in reasonably assured resources (<USD 40/kgU, - 39%) and inferred resources \n(<USD  40/kgU, -5%). The decreases were primarily the result of mining depletion and cost category  \nre-assignment s of resources in Kazakhstan and Canada. Also contributing to decreases in these and other \nuranium producing countries were changes in cut -off grades, updated recoverability information, currency \ninflation effects and re -evaluations of previously identifie d uranium resources. This resulted in the decline of \noverall recoverable uranium, downgrades from reasonably assured resources to inferred resources and re -\nassignment of resources to higher or sub -economic cost categories.  \nGlobally, Australia continues to lead with 28% of the world’s identified recoverable resources \n(reasonably assured + inferred resources) in the category <USD 130/kgU (equivalent to \nUSD  50/lb  U3O8). Almost 80% of Australia’s national total endowment is related to a single site, \nthe Olympi c Dam deposit. In terms of lower cost identified recoverable resources (<USD 80/kgU \nand <USD 40/kgU, equivalent to USD 30/lb  U3O8 and USD  15/lb  U3O8), Kazakhstan leads with 65% \nand 37% of the world total, respectively.  \nAustralia reported increases in reas onably assured recoverable resources due to updated \nresource estimates at Olympic Dam, but decreases in inferred recoverable resources, while Kazakhstan reported overall decreases in reasonably assured resources as a result of mining depletion and transfer  of high -cost resources to the sub -economic category. Noteworthy \nchanges in resources also occurred in other countries, such as Canada, Central African Republic, Mongolia, Namibia and Niger. Canada experienced a significant decrease in lowest cost category  \nreasonably assured recoverable resources (<USD 40/kgU) due to the combined effects of inflation, changes in cut -off grades and mining depletion. In other countries, the re -estimation of \nresources resulted in adjustments in resource values, such as shiftin g of resources from lower \nto higher cost categories and from inferred to reasonably assured resources.  \nGlobal identified recoverable resources of uranium , expressed in tonnes of uranium  metal (tU) , \nin the <USD  130/kgU category as of 1 January 2021 amounted  to 6 078 500 tU, a decrease of just \nover 1% compared to 2019. In the highest cost category (<USD  260/kgU, equivalent to \nUSD 100/lb  U\n3O8), total identified resources amounted to 7  917 500 tU, a decrease of nearly 2% \ncompared to the total reported for the p revious edition.  \nEXECUTIVE SUMMARY  \n10 URANIUM 2022: RESOURCES, PRODUCTION AND DEMAND, NEA No. 7634, © OECD 2023  Reasonably assured resources decreased most notably in the lowest cost category \n(<USD  40/kgU), by nearly 39% compared to the amounts reported in 2019. Small decreases also \noccurred in the <USD 80/kgU and <USD 260/kgU cost categories (2.6% and 0.7%, respectively), with \na slight increase of 0.6% in the <USD  130/kgU category.  \nInferred resources in the <USD 260/kgU cost category decreased overall by 3.5% from \n3 346 400 tU in 2019 to 3 229 200 tU in 2021, mainly due to the re- evaluation of reso urces and \nconversion of inferred to reasonably assured resources as a result of exploration activities. \nAustralia and Kazakhstan reported the most significant decreases, while Mongolia and Niger reported some increase in inferred resources.  \nAlthough all re sources in this publication are reported as recoverable, a summary has also \nbeen prepared for in situ  identified resources worldwide. The recovery factor from in situ to \nrecoverable resources is 74% overall, but increases to 83% when only resources in the low cost <USD 40/kgU category are considered. Compared with the previous edition, the total identified \nin situ resources increased slightly from 10 584 500 tU to 10  671 800 tU.  Reporting in situ  \nresources provides a more optimistic view of the available re source base and gives some \nindication of how the resource base could increase with improvements in mining and \nprocessing methods, which would lead to better recovery.  \nAdditions to the conventional resource base in the future could come from undiscovered \nresources (prognosticated resources and speculative resources), which as of 1  January 2021 \namounted to 7 365 500 tU, a 2% increase from the 7 220  300 tU reported in the previous edition. \nUnconventional resources are another source of potential future supply , and currently amount \nto nearly 39 million tU. It is important to note that in some cases, including several major \nproducing countries with large identified resource inventories, estimates of undiscovered resources and unconventional resources are either not reported or have not been updated for several years.  \nThe uranium resource figures presented in this volume are a snapshot of the situation as of \n1 January 2021, as reported mainly from official government sources. Readers should keep in \nmind that resou rce figures are dynamic and related to commodity prices.  \nExploration and mining development  \nContinuing a downward trend over several years, worldwide domestic exploration and mine development \nexpenditures decreased to approximately USD 250 million in 2020 from nearly USD  500 million in 2018 \nand over USD 2 billion in 2014 (note that expenditures m ade by junior exploration companies in some \nsignificant producing countries was unavailable). Preliminary data for 2021 expenditures suggest a minor increase to nearly USD 280 million. Non -domestic figures, a subset of global exploration and development \nexpenditures, declined significantly from nearly USD 420 million in 2016 to under USD 40 million in 2020, \nwith a minor increase to just over USD 70 million expected in 2021 (preliminary data). Total expenditures continue to decrease in response to a depressi on in the uranium market that has lasted since mid- 2011.  \nFrom 2014, total domestic expenditures dropped from over USD 2 billion to USD  876.5 million \nin 2015, USD 681.9 million in 2016, USD 482.9 million in 2018 and USD 251.3 million in 2020. In 2020, \nglobal expenditures on exploration and mine development were down 88% from 2014. However, \nglobal expenditures increased by 10% in 2021 from 2020 (preliminary data). Expenditures decreased in many countries, mainly because of persistently depressed uranium pric es, which \nslowed or delayed several exploration and mine development projects. Another reason is the \nsignificant spending on the construction of the Husab mine in Namibia which was completed in \n2017 after a three year project . \nTotal exploration and mine de velopment expenditures from 2018 through 2020 in the \nreporting countries amounted to USD 1.25 billion, with Canada, China, India, Russia and Kazakhstan leading the way. Expenditures in Canada alone exceeded the total spending of the remaining top five coun tries and amounted to 44% of the total.  \n  \nEXECUTIVE SUMMARY  \nURANIUM 2022: RESOURCES, PRODUCTION AND DEMAND, NEA No. 7634, © OECD 2023  11 From 2018 to 2020, the total estimated overall length of global exploration and development \ndrilling decreased by almost 50%, from 2  633 km to 1 363 km. Kazakhstan accounted over 58% of \nthe total exploration and de velopment drilling length reported in 2020, with India, Türkiye, Russia, \nNamibia and Ukraine accounting for most of the remainder. Part of this significant overall \ndecrease may be explained by the absence of drilling data f rom Canada and China for 2020.  \nProduction  \nGlobal uranium mine production decreased by nearly 12% from 2018 to 2020. Major producing countries, \nincluding Canada and Kazakhstan, limited total production in recent years in response to a depressed \nuranium market. Uranium production cuts deepened suddenly with the onset of the COVID -19 pandemic \nin early 2020. As of 1 January 2021, the annual production capacity of idled mines amounted to over 29 400 tU. These operations, which have all the necessary licenses, permits and agreements for operatio n \nand have produced commercially in the past, could potentially be brought back into production relatively rapidly given appropriate market conditions.  \nIn 2020, 16 countries produced uranium for a global total of 47  432 tU. Kazakhstan’s \ncontinuous growth in production reached a peak of 24  689 tU in 2016, after which it started to \ndecline in 2017 as production cuts were instituted to reduce supply to an oversupplied market. \nKazakhstan nonetheless remained by far the world’s largest producer, even as producti on was \neased back from 21 705 tU in 2018 to 19 477 tU in 2020. Kazakhstan’s 2020 production alone \ntotalled more than the combined production in that year from Australia, Namibia, Canada, and \nUzbekistan, respectively the second, third, fourth and fifth larg est producers of uranium in 2020. \nThese five countries accounted for 81% of global uranium output that year.  \nIn situ leaching (ISL) remained the dominant production technology throughout the reporting \nperiod, accounting for over 58% of total global uraniu m production in 2020 and approximately 63% \nin 2021.  \nOverall, world uranium production decreased by 12% from 53 501 tU in 2018 to 47 342 tU in \n2020 as producers instituted production cuts, followed by a slight increase to 47 472 tU in 2021. \nThese planned re ductions were greatest in Canada and Kazakhstan. In Canada, for example, \nuranium production was reduced by 45% from 6 996 tU in 2018 to 3 878 tU in 2020. Mining at Rabbit \nLake was suspended in mid -2016, while mining at the McArthur River and milling at Key Lake \nwere suspended at the end of January 2018, all due to unfavourable market conditions. Production \nalso declined dramatically in the United States. These actions are in addition to a list of 14 idled mines (defined as mines with associated identified u ranium resources and mining/processing \nfacilities that have all the necessary licenses, permits and agreements for operation and have \nproduced commercially in the past). As of 1 January 2021, the annual production capacity of idled \nmines amounted to over 2 9 400 tU. It should be noted, however, that idled mines could be brought \nback into production relatively rapidly with appropriate market signals.  \nPlanned uranium production cuts were further deepened with the onset of the COVID -19 \npandemic in early 2020. In Canada, in March 2020, Cameco announced that it had suspended \nproduction at the Cigar Lake mine and Orano announced that it had suspended work at the \nMcClean Lake mill in response to the COVID -19 pandemic. In Kazakhstan, in early April 2020, \nJSC Nationa l Atomic Company Kazatomprom announced that it was reducing operational \nactivities at all uranium mines for three months due to the COVID -19 pandemic. The pandemic \nalso caused restrictions at other mining operations, such as in Australia, Namibia and South  \nAfrica. In August 2020, some of these restrictions were eased and several producers gradually \nresumed production. However, with these unplanned reductions, some producers did not reach \ntheir 2020 production targets.  \n  \nEXECUTIVE SUMMARY  \n12 URANIUM 2022: RESOURCES, PRODUCTION AND DEMAND, NEA No. 7634, © OECD 2023  Environmental and social aspects of u ranium exploration and production  \nWith uranium production projected to expand to meet global demand over the medium -term, efforts are \nbeing made to develop safe mining practices and to continue to minimise environmental impacts. The \ncountry reports provide some updates about the environmental and social aspects of uranium mining, \nincluding site remediation and decommissioning projects, which highlight the progress that the uranium \nindustry has made on environmental stewardship.  \nAlthough the focus of this p ublication remains uranium resources, production and demand, \nthe environmental and social aspects of the uranium production cycle are gaining in importance and, as in the last few editions, updates on activities in this area have been included in the \ncount ry reports. With a need for increased uranium production to meet demand, the continued \ndevelopment of transparent, safe and well -regulated operations that minimise environmental \nimpacts is crucial, particularly for those countries hosting uranium production for the first time.  \nFor this edition, 26 countries provided information on activities related to the environmental \naspects of the uranium production cycle, including ongoing work related to closed facilities and \npolicy/regulatory -related issues.  \nAdditional information on the environmental aspects of uranium production may be found \nin Managing Environmental and Health Impacts of Uranium Mining (NEA, 2014\n1), which outlines the \nsignificant improvements made in these areas since the early strategic period of uranium \nmining. The IAEA Bulletin, Uranium: From Exploration to Remediation  (IAEA, 20182) includes some \ninformation on this topic. More recently, the NEA published a comprehensive overview of the \nexperiences in the uranium mining industry of working with Indigenous people and local \ncommunities to maximise overall benefits for all stakeholders in Maximising Uranium Mining’s \nSocial and Economic Benefits: A Guide for Stakeholders  (NEA, 20233). \nUranium demand  \nWorld nuclear capacity is expected to rise f or the foreseeable future as global energy demand is projected \nto increase and the need for a clean energy transition grows. Reactor -related uranium requirements vary \nconsiderably from region to region, reflecting projected nuclear capacity increases and possible inventory \nbuilding. Annual uranium requirements are projected to be largest in the East Asia region by 2040. \nRecognising the security of supply, reliability and predictability that nuclear power offers and promoting \nincentives for all types of low -carbon technologies are key conditions for greater growth in nuclear capacity, \nand consequently, in ur anium demand.   \nAs of 1 January 2021, a total of 442  commercial nuclear reactors were connected to the grid \nglobally, with a net generating capacity of 393  GWe requiring about 60 100  tU annually (about \n150 tU per GWe of electrical generating capacity for an already -operating reactor). Taking into \naccount changes in policies announced in several countries and revised nuclear programmes \nas of 1 January 2021, w orld nuclear capacity by 2040 is projected to remain at the current level \nof 394  GW in the low demand case but increase to 677  GW in the high demand case (an increase \nof around 70%, with respect to 2020 capacity). Accordingly, world annual reactor -related \nuranium requirements (excluding the use of mixed oxide fuels, which is marginal) are projected to rise to between 63 000 tU/y and 108 200 tU/y by 2040.  \n  \n                                                      \n1.

East Asia is \nprojected t o experience the largest increase of generating capacity in absolute terms, which, by \nthe year 2040, could result in increases of between 35 GW and 152 GW over 2020 capacity, \ncorresponding to 130% and 240% increases in the low and high cases, respectively.  While \nrepresenting a significant regional capacity increase, it is important to note that  countries of \nthis region (e.g.  China) have in recent years demonstrated the ability to build multiple reactors \nwith predictable costs and schedules.  \nOther regions p rojected to experience significant nuclear capacity growth by 2040 include \nthe Middle East, Central and Southern Asia. For these regions collectively, the low and high \ncases project an additional growth of between 27 GW and 51 GW with respect to 2020 capac ity.  \nIn Europe, nuclear capacity in non -EU member countries is projected to increase in the high \ncase scenario to 93 GW by 2040. On the basis of 2021 data, in the European Union, nuclear \ncapacity in 2040 is projected to decrease by 25% in the low case scenario and increase only by \n16% in the high case with respect to 2020 capacity.  \nModest growth in terms of absolute capacity increase is projected in Africa, Central and \nSouth America and South -eastern Asia.  \nFor North America, the projections see nuclear generating capacity decreasing by 2040 in \nthe low case ( -42%) and roughly flat  in the high case (+3%), with respect to 2020 capacity. These \nprojections depend largely on future electricity demand, lifetime extensions of existing reactors, \ngovernment policies wit h respect to greenhouse gas emissions and investment in new  nuclear \npower  capacity.  \nAs in the case of nuclear capacity, uranium requirements vary considerably from region to \nregion, reflecting projected capacity increases and possible inventory building. By 2040, annual uranium requirements are projected to be largest in the East Asia reg ion, where an increase in \ninstalled nuclear generating capacity drives significant growth in uranium needs.  \nKey factors influencing future nuclear energy capacity include projected electricity demand, \nthe economic competitiveness of nuclear power plants, associated financing arrangements for \nsuch capital -intensive projects, proposed waste management strategies and public acceptance of \nnuclear energy and national energy security strategies. The extent to which nuclear energy is seen \nto be beneficial in clim ate change mitigation and in securing greater energy independence in light \nof recent geopolitical events will be key to unlocking even greater projected growth in nuclear capacity and, consequently, in uranium demand.  \nThe importance of energy security was  highlighted by the COVID -19 pandemic in 2020 and \n2021 and even more so in 2022 by the war in Ukraine and the ensuing energy security crisis in \nEurope. Realising the full contribution of nuclear power to climate change mitigation and to energy \nsecurity req uires recognising the reliability and predictability that nuclear power offers and \nproviding appropriate incentives for all types of low -carbon technologies, in particular new builds \nof both conventional large reactors and small modular reactors. In the ne ar term, extensions to \nthe operating timeframes of existing nuclear power plants are also required. Already in 2021 and 2022, many governments (including France, Japan and Korea) changed their policies in favour of developing nuclear energy sources, both c onventional and advanced new reactors.  It can be \nanticipated that these policy shifts will impact the projections in future editions of the Red Book.  \nSupply and demand relationship \nThe currently defined resource base is more than adequate to meet even high  case uranium demand through \n2040, but doing so will depend upon timely investments to turn resources into production. At the end of the \nreporting period, meeting high case demand requirements to 2040 would consume about 80% of the total \n2020 identified re coverable resource base at a cost of <USD 30/lb U 3O8 (USD 80/kgU). In light of more recent \nmarket prices sustained through the end of 2022, meeting high case growth requirements to 2040 would consume about 26% of identified recoverable resources available at a cost of <USD  50/lb U\n3O8 (USD 130/kgU).  \nEXECUTIVE SUMMARY  \n14 URANIUM 2022: RESOURCES, PRODUCTION AND DEMAND, NEA No. 7634, © OECD 2023  As of 1 January 2021, world uranium production covered nearly 79% of world reactor \nrequirements, down from about 86% in 2019, with the remainder supplied by secondary sources. \nSuch secondary supply includes exce ss government and commercial inventories, spent fuel \nreprocessing, underfeeding and uranium produced by the re -enrichment of depleted uranium \ntails, as well as low -enriched uranium produced by blending down highly enriched uranium.  \nDuring the past decade, the decline in uranium market prices after  the 2011 Fukushima \nDaiichi accident and the uncertainty about nuclear power development in some countries \nreduced uranium requirements, further depressed prices and slowed the pace of mine \nproduction and developme nt. More recently, the increase in uranium spot prices (at the end of \n2022 to around USD 50/lb U 3O8 or USD 130/kgU), can be explained by the additional curtailments \nto primary production brought on by the COVID -19 pandemic in 2020 and 2021 and the \nuncertai nties related to the shifting geopolitical situation in 2022. It is worth noting, however, \nthat the reduction in uranium mining and ore processing activities due to the pandemic did not \ndisrupt the performance of nuclear power reactors, as utilities and fu el cycle producers hold \nsignificant inventories.  \nMeeting high case growth requirements to 2040 would consume about 26% of identified \nrecoverable resources available at a cost of <USD 130/kgU and about 20% of these at a cost of \n<USD  260/kgU. However, when considering lower cost resources, in light of 2020 and 2021 \nmarket prices, at a cost of less than USD 80/kgU, in the high demand case meeting projected requirements to 2040 would consume about 80% of identified recoverable resources.  \nFor the foreseeable fu ture, projected primary uranium  production capabilities , including \nexisting, committed, planned and prospective production centres, would satisfy projected low -\ncase requirements through 2040, and partially satisfy high -case requirements, if new mining \ndeve lopments proceed as planned.  \nFor this to happen, however, significant investment and technical expertise will be required \nto bring these resources to the market. Producers will have to overcome a number of significant, and at times unpredictable, issues in bringing new production facilities on stream, including \ngeopolitical and local factors, technical challenges and complex legal and regulatory frameworks. \nStrong market conditions will be critical to achieve the required industry investment.  \nAlthough low  market prices have led to significant reductions in uranium production and a \ndelay in some mine development projects in recent years, other projects have advanced through \nfurther stages of development. An improvement of uranium market conditions should also see \nsome of the delayed projects or idled mines reactivated in order to ensure supply to a growing global nuclear fleet. The current global network of uranium mine facilities is relatively sparse, \ncreating the potential for supply vulnerabilities. Howev er, utilities have been building significant \ninventory over the last few years at reduced prices, which should help to protect them from such events in the near term.  \nAlthough information on secondary sources is incomplete, the availability of these source s is \ngenerally expected to decline somewhat in the 2020s. Existing information, however, indicates \nthat there remains a significant amount of previously mined uranium, some of which could \npossibly be brought to the market in the coming years. With the enrichment capacity temporarily \nin excess of requirements, enrichment providers are well- positioned to reduce tails assays below \ncontractual requirements and thereby create additional uranium supply. In the longer term, \nalternative fuel cycles, if successfully  developed and implemented and, in particular, closing the \nfuel cycle, could have a very significant impact on the uranium market. It is too early to say how cost-effective and widely implemented these proposed alternative fuel cycles could be.  \nConclusions  \nSufficient uranium resources exist to support continued use of nuclear power and significant \ngrowth in nuclear capacity for electricity generation and other uses (e.g. heat, water, hydrogen) \nin the near to long term. Identified recoverable resources, which include reasonably assured and \ninferred resources combined, at a cost category of <USD 260/kgU (equivalent to USD  100/lb  U3O8), \nEXECUTIVE SUMMARY  \nURANIUM 2022: RESOURCES, PRODUCTION AND DEMAND, NEA No. 7634, © OECD 2023  15 are sufficient for more than 130 years, considering the uranium requirements of the year 2020. \nAt the end of the reporting period for this edition of the “Red Book”, when early 2021 uranium \nmarket prices were about USD 30/lb U 3O8 (USD 78/kg U), only 25% of the recoverable resource \nbase outlined in this edit ion of the “Red Book” could be economically brought into production, \nsince resources with estimated mining costs greater than 80 USD/kgU cannot be profit ably mined \nat such prices. Hence, given those market and economic conditions, identified recoverable \nresources at a cost category of <USD 80/kgU (equivalent to USD 30/lb  U3O8, the average price of \nuranium in early 2021) would be sufficient for only about 30 years of global reactor -related \nuranium requirements, considering 202 0 uranium requirement figures.  At average market prices \nof about USD 50/lb U 3O8 (USD  130/kg U), beginning in mid -2021 and sustained through the \nbeginning of 2023, approximately 75% of the recoverable resource base could be economically \nbrought into production, representing about 100 ye ars of uranium requirements. Favourable \nprices would  need to be sustained  – and significant timely investment and technical expertise \nwill be required  – to turn these resources into refined uranium ready for nuclear fuel production.  \nGlobal uranium demand is expected to continue to increase in the next several decades to \nmeet large population needs, particularly in emerging economies . Since nuclear energy produces \ncompetitively priced, low -carbon baseload electricity and enhances the security of energy supp ly, \nit is projected to remain an important component in the mix of low carbon  energy supply.   \nThe abundance of low -cost natural gas in North America and the risk -averse investment \nclimate have reduced the competitiveness of nuclear power plants in some lib eralised electricity \nmarkets. Government and market policies that recognise the benefits of low -carbon electricity \nproduction and the security of energy supplied by nuclear power plants could help alleviate \nthese competitive pressures.  \nIn 2021 and 2022, th e perception of nuclear energy as a strategic resource for energy \nindependence has started to change in many countries, as reflected by recent government nuclear energy policy changes. Noting that this was also due to the dramatic European energy \ncrisis of  2022 brought by the shifting geopolitical situation, the  2024 edition of the “Red Book” \nwill aim to provide a fuller picture of the implications of these developments on uranium demand and supply.  \nAfter a period of reductions in uranium production, slowed  investment and comparatively \nlow prices, it remains to be seen whether the quickly evolving market and policy environment will provide incentives for the uranium market to expand substantially in the coming decades .  \n \n URANIUM SUPPLY  \nURANIUM 2022: RESOURCES, PRODUCTION AND DEMAND, NEA No. 7634, © OECD 2023  17 Chapter 1. Uranium supply  \nThis chapter summarises the status of worldwide uranium resources, exploration and \nproduction. The data reporting  period for this edition of the Red Book covers 1  January  2019 to \n1 January 2021 (i.e.  the calendar years 2019 and 2020). However, some important information for \n2021 and 2022 has also been included when needed.  \nUranium resources  \nUranium resources are clas sified by a scheme (based on geological certainty and costs of production) \ndeveloped to combine resource estimates from a number of different countries into harmonised global \nfigures. Identified resources  (which include reasonably assured resources , or RAR,  and inferred \nresources , or IR) refer to uranium deposits delineated by sufficient direct measurement to conduct pre-\nfeasibility and sometimes feasibility studies. For reasonably assured resources , high confidence in \nestimates of grade and tonnage are gen erally compatible with mining decision -making standards. \nInferred resources  are not defined with such a high degree of confidence and generally require further \ndirect measurement prior to making a decision to mine. Undiscovered resources  (which include \npro gnosticated  resources , or PR, and speculative resources , or SR) refer to resources that are expected \nto exist based on geological knowledge of previously discovered deposits and regional geological \nmapping. Prognosticated resources  refer to those expected to exist in known uranium provinces, \ngenerally supported by some direct evidence. Speculative resources  refer to those expected to exist in \ngeological provinces that may host uranium deposits. Both prognosticated  and speculative resources  \nrequire significant amounts of exploration before their existence can be confirmed and grades and \ntonnages can be defined. Unconventional resources are defined as very low -grade resources or those \nfrom which uranium is only recoverable as a minor by -produ ct or co -product. For a more detailed \ndescription, see Appendix 3.  \nIdentified conventional resources  \nThe global distribution of identified conventional resources, recoverable at a cost of less than \nUSD 130/kgU is shown  in Figure 1.1. Identified resources consist of reasonably assured resources  \n(RAR) and inferred resources (IR) recoverable at a cost of less than USD  260/kgU (USD 100/lb U 3O8; \nsee Appendix 3). Unless otherwise noted, resource figures in this report refer e xclusively to \nrecoverable resources ; that is, the potential amount of uranium recovered after losses from \nmining and processing are deducted. In situ resources  are also presented at times in this report, \nreferring to the estimated amount of uranium in the ground, and are clearly indicated as such \n(see Appendix 3).  \nRelative changes in different resource and cost categories of global identified resources \nbetween this edition and the 2020 edition of the Red  Book are summarised in Table  1.1 (note \nthat resources  of a given cost category also include resources from lower cost categories, in \nother words, the resource amounts are cumulative from lowest to highest cost category; see \nAppendix 3 about how to read and interpret cost category resource figures).  \n  \nURANIUM SUPPLY  \n18 URANIUM 2022: RESOURCES, PRODUCTION AND DEMAND, NEA No. 7634, © OECD 2023  Figure 1.1.

Together, these 15 countries are endowed with 95% of the global resource base  as specified \nabove (the remaining 5% are distributed among another 24 countries). The widespread distribution of uranium resource s is an important geographic aspect of nuclear energy in light of security of \nenergy supply.  \n\n URANIUM SUPPLY  \nURANIUM 2022: RESOURCES, PRODUCTION AND DEMAND, NEA No. 7634, © OECD 2023  19 Table 1.1.

(a) Changes might not equal differences between 2019 and 2021 because of independent rounding.  (b) Resources in  the \ncost category of <USD 40/kgU and <USD 80/kgU should be regarded with some caution since some countries do not report low -cost \nresource estimates, mainly for  confidentiality concerns, whereas othe r countries that have never, or not recently, hosted ura nium mining \nmay be underestimating mining costs.  \nContrary to recent editions , the overall picture from 1  January 2019 to 1 January 2021 is one \nof decreasing global identified conventional uranium resources  with the decrease in recoverable \nresources greates t (-28%; >304 000 tU) in the lowest cost category (<USD 40/kgU). Decreases in \nidentified conventional resources occurred in all higher cost categories as well but were much \nless pronounced (<2%). Highest cost (<USD 260/kgU) identified recoverable resources  totalled \nover 7.9 million tU  a decline of 1.9% from 2019. Low -cost (<USD 40/kgU) RAR declined most \ndramatically ( -39%; 287 000 tU) and higher cost RAR followed a similar pattern to total identified \nresources , with declines in each cost category amounting to <3%. IR declined less dramatically \noverall ( -5%) except for the <USD 80kgU cost category  which inc reased modestly by 2.1% \n(16 000 tU). \nThe overall decrease in the lowest cost category (<USD  40/kgU) of identified conventional \nresources is principally the result of the removal of over 250 000 tU from the lowest cost category \nin Canada (the country no longer reports in this category) , along with mining depletion in Canada , \nKazakhstan and Uzbekistan . As of 1  January 2021,  only Argentina  (2 400 tU), Brazil  (138 100 tU), \nChina  (73 200 tU), Kazakhstan  (502 000 tU), Spain  (8 100 tU) and Uzbekistan  (52 100 tU) reported \nrecoverable uranium re sources in the lowest cost category (<USD 40/kgU). Much less dramatic \ndeclines (- 2% or less) of identified resources in the higher cost (<USD 80/kgU , <USD  130/kgU and \n<USD  260/kgU) , were principally the result of mining depletion in Russia  and Ukraine , the \nremoval  of over 100  000 tU of high -cost resources in Kazakhstan  (Kosachinoye field open -pit and \nunderground resources) , downgrading of Bakouma resources in the  Central African Republic , the \nmovement of lower cost (<USD 80/kgU) resources in  Mongolia  to higher cost categories and \nreductions due to the reassessment of recoverability factors in China  and Türkiye . This was \nbalanced by increases in Guyana , Hungary, India , Malawi , Mauritania, Mongolia , Namibia , Niger  \nand, to a lesser extent Paraguay , as a result of a combination of new discoveries and ongoing \nexploration activities , supplemented by the movement of resources into higher cost categories \nin Canada  and the United  States .  \nURANIUM SUPPLY  \n20 URANIUM 2022: RESOURCES, PRODUCTI ON AND DEMAND, NEA No. 7634, © OECD 2023  Current estimates of identified resources, RAR and IR , on a country- by-country basis , are \npresented in Tables 1.2, 1.3 and 1.4 and graphically summarise d in Figures 1.2 and 1.3.

As of 1  January 2021 , low-cost RAR and IR \ncomprised <10% of total RAR and IR , declining by 6% and 0.2% respectively from 2019.  \nAustralia  reported increased RAR and decreased IR in the higher cost categories \n(<USD  130/kgU and 260/kgU) due to Olympic Dam resource figure updates and reassessment of \nrecoverability information for some deposits. Canada reported a significant decline in low -cost \n(<USD 40/kgU) RAR owing to the combined effects of increased mining costs and cut -off grade \nchange that reflects a uranium price <USD 80/kgU. The Central African Republic  reported \nreduced high -cost (<USD 260/kgU) resources , downgraded from RAR to IR , resu lting from the \nreassessment of resources at the Bakouma deposit. In Hungary , additional high -cost \n(<USD  260/kgU) Mecsek Mountain resources identified through private company exploration \nefforts were incorporated into national resource totals , leading to an  increase in IR. In India , \nongoing exploration efforts led to a 13% increase in high -cost (<USD 260/kgU) RAR , compared to \n2019. Kazakhstan  reported decreased RAR and IR (with the exception of IR <USD  80/kgU category) \nresulting from ongoing mining depletion  and the transfer of high -cost open -pit and \nunderground Kosachinoye field resources to the subeconomic category , balanced by increases \nin IR at sites No. 6 and No. 7 of the Budennovskoye field. Updated resource evaluations by the \nnew owner of the Kayeleker a uranium project in Malawi  led to increases in higher cost \n(<USD  130/kgU and 260/kgU) RAR. Ongoing exploration at the Tirus deposit in Mauritania led to \nincreases in higher cost (<USD 130/kgU and 260/kgU) RAR and IR. In Mongolia , ongoing \nexploration led t o the identification of higher cost (<USD 130/kgU and 260/kgU) RAR and IR and \nreassessment of mining costs led to a shift of resources into higher cost categories. Ongoing \nexploration in Namibia  boosted RAR and IR resource totals in all categories (with th e exception \nof IR <USD 130/kgU) , including the addition of lower cost (<USD 80/kgU) RAR and IR resulting \nfrom the discovery of the first deposit (Wings) in the country potentially amenable to in situ \nleaching (ISL) mining. Decreases in RAR and IR occurred across all cost categories in China  and \nTürkiye  owing to recovery factor reductions in both countries resulting from Secretariat \nassessment of local geologic conditions.  \nAustralia  still dominates the world’s uranium resources with 28% of the total identified  \nresources at <USD 130/kgU and 25% of identified resources in the highest cost category \n(<USD  260/kgU). However , 68% of Australia ’s uranium resources (and 17% of global identified \nresources) are attributed to the world -class polymetallic Fe -oxide breccia  complex , the Olympic \nDam deposit , where uranium is mined as a co -product. Kazakhstan  remains a distant second \nwith approximately 13% available at <USD  130/kgU and 11% in the <USD  260/kgU cost category.  \nCanada’s share has been reduced slightly since the la st reporting period to about 10% in the \n<USD 130/kgU category and 11% in the <USD 260/kgU category. All remaining countries have less than a 10% share in these higher cost categories. There are 15 countries that represent approximately 95% of the total ide ntified resources in the <USD  130/kgU cost category (see \nFigure 1.1).  \nWith respect to the lower cost categories,  Australia  does not report any resources at these \ncosts and thus  Kazakhstan leads with 64% of lowest cost resources (<USD 40/kgU), followed by \nBrazil  (18%) , China  (9%), Uzbekistan  (7%), Spain (1%) and Argentina (<1%) , the only six countries \nreporting resources in this cost category for this edition. In the <USD  80/kgU cost category , \nKazakhstan holds a 37% share , followed by Canada (15%) , Brazil  and South Africa  (12%) , China (7%), \nUzbekistan  (3%) and Spain  (1%), with Argentina, Mongolia , Niger  each holding <1% shares in this \ncost category. Readers are cautioned concerning these lower cost resource estimates \n(<USD  40/kgU , <USD  80/kgU) , since Austral ia does not report resources in these cost categories, \nthe United States  does not report IR , and some countries that have never (or have not recently) \nhosted uranium mining may be underestimating mining costs.  \nStarting in the 2016 edition , a summary has be en prepared of worldwide in situ identified \nconventional resources (see Tables 1.2b , 1.3b and 1.4b). Table 1.2c is a summary comparison of in \nsitu identified resources and recoverable identified resources by cost category. Overall, there is a \n17% to 26% in crease in the resource figures when they are reported as in situ. This corresponds to \naverage recoveries ranging from approximately 74% to 83%. Total identified in situ resources \nincreased marginally (<1%) from 10  584 500 tU reported in the last edition to 10 671 800 tU for this \nURANIUM SUPPLY  \n34 URANIUM 2022: RESOURCES, PRODUCTI ON AND DEMAND, NEA No. 7634, © OECD 2023  edition as only three countries provided both in situ and recoverable figures, and conversions \nproduced by the application of generic  recovery factors (see Appendix  3) as NEA/IAEA estimates \nwere , in the cases of China  and Türkiye , adjusted by the IAEA Secretariat to be more \ncommensurate with the geological settings of the uranium deposits and planned mining \ntechnologies in these countries.  \nReporting in situ resources provides a more optimistic view of the available resource base \nand provides an indication of how the resource base could be increased with improvements in mining and processing methods that would lead to better recovery. Nonethe less, recoverable \nresources still provide the best and more realistic estimate of uranium supply.  \nDistribution of resources by production method  \nFor this edition of the Red Book , countries once again were asked to report identified resources \nby cost catego ries and by the expected production method: open -pit or underground mining , in \nsitu leaching (ISL , sometimes referred to as in situ recovery , or ISR) , heap leaching or in -place \nleaching , co-product/by -product , or unspecified.  \nIn the cost category <USD  40/kgU, although underground and open- pit mining remain \nimportant production methods for RAR (Table  1.6) in Brazil  (where resources for open -pit mining \nhave been developed in recent years) , ISL (acid) has surpassed the combined total of underground \nand open -pit mining , as well as ISL alkaline and co -product/by -product production , in this , the \nlowest cost category of high confidence resources. Low -cost resources amenable to production by \nISL, mainly in Kazakhstan, and to a lesser extent China and Uzbekistan , make the most significant \ncontributions. Resources suited for co- product/by -product production and underground mining \nin Brazil  make up the remainder , followed by alkaline ISL (China). The total of low -cost resources \nis likely underestimated ow ing to the difficulty in assigning mining costs accurately in the co-\nproduct/by -product category , notably in Australia .  \nTable 1.6.

ISL makes an important \ncontribution in all cost categories , with Kazakhstan  being the dominant player for ISL acid and \nChina  and the United  States  for ISL alkaline.  \nThe pattern of resource distribution by production method for IR (Table  1.7) is similar to that \nfor RAR. In the lowest cost categories (<USD  40/kgU and <USD  80/kgU) , resources amenable to ISL \nproduction dominate , principally in Kaz akhstan. In the <USD  130/kgU category , ISL acid continues \nto lead , dominated by Kazakhstan and Uzbekistan , but is followed closely by co- product/by -\nproduct ( Australia , Brazil  and South  Africa ), open -pit (mainly Botswana , Jordan , Namibia  and \nNiger ) and unde rground mining (mainly Australia , Canada , China, Russia  and Ukraine ). In the \nhighest cost category (<USD  260/kgU) , underground mining (mainly Canada  and Russia ) leads with \nco-product/by -product (mainly Australia , Brazil , Greenland  and South  Africa ), open pit (mainly \nAustralia  and Namibia ) and ISL (mainly Kazakhstan, followed by Australia , the Czech  Republic  \nand Uzbekistan ) making significant contributions. Since the United  States  does not report IR , the \nISL alkaline category is under -represented in Ta ble 1.7.  \nTable 1.7.

It should be noted that not all countries reported their \nresources according to processing method.  \nThe overall distribution has changed somewhat since the last reporting period , owing to the \nreclassification of Canadian resources from the lowest cost category (<USD 40/kgU), considerably \nreducing the share of low -cost resources amenable to underground mining. In all but the lowest \ncost category for RA R, where ISL amenable resources dominate (Table  1.8), conventional \nprocessing from underground mining is the major contributor , particularly in the higher cost \ncategories (<USD 130/kgU and <USD 260/kgU) , owing principally to Australia ’s Olympic Dam \ndeposit . In the higher cost categories , conventional processing from open pit and ISL make \nincreasing contributions, but even when combined do not surpass the underground resources. \nHeap leaching from open- pit and underground mining become increasingly important in the \nhigher cost categories (<USD 130/kgU and <USD 260/kgU) , particularly in Botswana , Namibia  and \nNiger .  \nURANIUM SUPPLY  \n36 URANIUM 2022: RESOURCES, PRODUCTI ON AND DEMAND, NEA No. 7634, © OECD 2023  Table 1.8.

(c) China has conducted a systematic nat ionwide uranium \nresource prediction and evaluation with prognosticat ed resources estimated to be around 2 million tU. Since a cost range is not assigned to these \nresources, they are not included in this table.  \n URANIUM SUPPLY  \nURANIUM 2022: RESOURCES, PRODUCTION AND DEMAND, NEA No. 7634, © OECD 2023  41 The US  Geological Survey in the United States , for example , is now re -estimating undiscovered \nresources using a combination of mineral prospectivity mapping and the “3 -Part” form of \nquantitative mineral resource assessment (Singer et al. , 2010). Two assessments have been \ncompleted , estimating about 84  500 tU recoverable in the Texas Coastal Plain and 15  000 tU in situ \nin the Southern High Plains region (Mihalasky et al. , 2015; Hall et al. , 2017). However , this recent \nwork is yet to be classified into either PR or SR categories and , as a result , is not reported in Table \n1.13. As of 2022, only about 10% of the undiscov ered uranium resources in the United  States  have \nbeen recently reassessed. There is interest in completing more assessments and plans have been \nmade , but the assessments have not yet been conducted.  \nChina , as well , reports significant resource potentia l not included in Table 1.13. A  systematic \nnationwide uranium resource prediction and evaluation estimated that PR amounted to \n2 million tU. Since a cost range is not assigned to these resources , they are not include d in \nTable  1.13.  \nTotal PR in the highest co st category (<USD 260/kgU) amounted to 1.662 million  tU, a 3.5% \nincrease compared to 2019. In the lower cost categories (i.e.  <USD  80/kgU and <USD  130/kgU) , \nthe PR totals increased by <1% and 3.7% respectively , compared to the last reporting period. \nIncrea ses were reported for Argentina  and Egypt  in the <USD 80/kgU and <USD 130/kgU cost \ncategories , Hungary  and India  in the <USD 260/kgU cost category and Kazakhstan  in all three \ncost categories (<USD 80/kgU , <USD  130/kgU and <USD  260/kgU). Decreases were repo rted for \nPeru  in the <USD  130/kgU and <USD  260/kgU cost categories and Russia  in the highest cost \ncategory (<USD 260/kgU). No changes have been reported for the remaining countries since the \nlast reporting period.  \nSpeculative resources in the <USD  130/kgU and <USD  260/kgU cost categories increased by \n1.1% and 1.3% respectively , compared to 2019, due to increases reported by Peru  and Kazakhstan, \noffset by decreased SR in the highest cost category (<USD  260/kgU) recorded by Russia . The \nunassigned cost categor y increased overall by 1.7% , owing to increases reported by India, \nKazakhstan and Namibia , offset by reductions in Russia . The total SR in the <USD  130/kgU cost \ncategory increased by 1.1% since the last report , with increases reported by Kazakhstan and Peru. \nNo other countries reported changes in this cost category.  \nHigh -cost (<USD 260/kgU) PR and total SR amount to a combined total of 7  365 530 tU, an \nincrease of 2% from the 7 218 540 tU reported in 2019.  \nOther resources and materials  \nConventional resources  are defined as resources from which uranium is recoverable as a \nprimary product , a co-product or an important by -product , while unconventional resources  are \nresources from which uranium is only recoverable as a minor by -product , such as uranium \nassociated with phosphate rocks , non-ferrous ores , carbonatite , black shale and lignite (see \nAppendix 3 for definitions).  \nIn essence , conventional resources are the types of resources that have historically been \nmined , whereas unconventional resources have  only been mined occasionally , although there \nare exceptions. Moreover , the distinction between conventional and unconventional resources \nis not consistently defined: some countries consider unconventional resources to be a part of their conventional resou rce endowment: 1) if uranium grades are relatively high; 2) if uranium \nwas the principal exploration target; or 3) if conventional resources are not available in the \nquantities needed to meet domestic requirements.  \nHistorically , phosphate deposits (Barthel , 2005) are the only unconventional resources from \nwhich a significant amount of uranium has been produced. Processing of Moroccan  phosphate \nrock in  Belgium  produced 690 tU between 1975 and 1999, and about 17 150 tU were recovered in \nthe United  States from Florida phosphate rocks between 1954 and 1962. As much as 40 000 tU were \nalso recovered from processing marine organic deposits (essentially concentrations of ancient fish bones in Kazakhstan). In the former German Democratic Republic , low grade ( <0.006%  U) Silurian \nblack shales in the Ronneburg ore field were a source of significant quantities of uranium (nearly \n100 000 tU) between 1950 and 1990 (IAEA , 2020). However , except for Belgian  production from \nURANIUM SUPPLY  \n42 URANIUM 2022: RESOURCES, PRODUCTI ON AND DEMAND, NEA No. 7634, © OECD 2023  phosphates , production from such low -grade  unconventional resources was undertaken \nprincipally to meet strategic demand when uranium prices were high and , in some cases, \nproduction costs were not considered important.  \nMost of the unconventional uranium resources reported to date are associated with uranium \nin black shales and phosphate rocks , but other potential sources exist (e.g.  seawater , discussed \nbelow). Estimates of uranium resources associated with marine and organic phosphorite deposits \npoint to the existence of almost 9 million tU in four co untries alone: Jordan , Mexico , Morocco  and \nthe United  States .  Estimates of global uranium resources associated with phosphate rocks range \nconsiderably, from 6 million to 9 million tU (cited in IAEA reports, 1965 -1993 Red Books, and \nHaneklaus [2021] ), to as high as 22 million to 24 million tU (cited in Red Book 200 5, and derived \nfrom the IAEA UDEPO database; see below).  These estimates use various assumptions, \nmethodologies, cut -off grades  and other considerations, such as some addressing reserves and \nother  resources. A more comprehensive discussion about the unc ertainty of phosphate resources \nis presented in Gabriel et al. (2013) and Haneklaus (2021).  \nThe variation in these estimates shows that these figures should be considered  as part of a \ngeneral mineral inventory rather than conforming to standard categories used in reporting resources. The development of more rigorous estimates of uranium in phosphate rocks will be required if uranium market prices justify the economic extra ction of uranium during the \nexploitation of these deposits.  \nUnconventional resources are not usually classified to the same degree of certainty as \nconventional resources (i.e.  they are not identified resources) , although there are notable \nexceptions. The m ajority are not currently being mined but at least some have been mined in \nthe past , as noted above , and could be mined in the future in the right circumstances. Until \ndemand and prices increase , however , most unconventional resources are not economically \nfeasible sources of uranium in current market conditions.  \nUnconventional resources and the UDEPO database  \nThe IAEA maintains a database of global uranium deposits , “UDEPO”. It is primarily a geological \n(mineral deposit) database , with little emphasis give n to the economic aspects or implications of \nuranium ore bodies. It has several specific purposes, the primary one being to provide insights \ninto uranium mineralisation. It is also used for the evaluation of regional- scale resource potential \nas well as related modelling and assessment methods.  \nUDEPO consists of uranium -bearing occurrences for which a resource estimate is (or was) \navailable. They are classified into 15 main types and 50 subtypes according to the IAEA uranium deposit -type classification syst em (see IAEA , 2018b) , several of which are considered to be largely \nsubeconomic at the present time (these are dominated by low -grade unconventional deposit types, \nsuch as black shale deposits). For a given deposit , the maximum resource publicly reported i s \nrecorded. It is commonly an estimate calculated using the lowest cut -off grade , without any \nmining and processing constraints , and/or including all low -reliability mineralisation inferred. In \nrare cases , remaining resources or production estimates are given where they are the only known \namounts available , but in general the resources given are the largest known initial resources. In \naddition , in some instances, a deposit in UDEPO may represent an ore body, or one of two or more \nmines exploiting a single larger ore body , or a mining district consisting of multiple ore bodies and \nmines that has not been disaggregated.  \nFor the sake of completeness, UDEPO also contains many historic resources that do not \ncomply with modern resource estimating procedures, or that utilise a variety of estimation \ntechniques. Moreover , particularly in the case of unconventional resources , where formal \nresource estimates are rare , Secretariat estimates are given using minimal data. Secretariat \nestimates are also given for deposits that have not yet undergone formal ore delineation analyses , \nand may never be developed for economic reasons , such as low tonnages or low grades. These \ndeposits, however , are important for predicting (modelling) the location and amount of \nundiscovered ura nium resources at regional scales, and hence included in UDEPO.  \n URANIUM SUPPLY  \nURANIUM 2022: RESOURCES, PRODUCTION AND DEMAND, NEA No. 7634, © OECD 2023  43 It is important to note that the Red Book and UDEPO define “unconventional resources” \nsomewhat differently. For the Red Book , unconventional resources are “resources from which \nuranium is only  recoverable as a minor by- product , such as uranium associated with phosphate \nrocks , non- ferrous ores , porphyry copper , carbonatite , black shale and coal -lignite”. For UDEPO , \nwhich is first and foremost a geological database , there is no economic connotation , thus \nunconventional resources are those of low to very low grade that are not or cannot be mined just \nfor uranium. For example , with respect to deposit types, the Red Book considers resources \nassociated with phosphate , lignite coal, black shale , polyme tallic Fe -oxide breccia complex (with \nthe exception of the Olympic Dam uranium by- product deposit in Australia ), and a subtype of \nintrusive deposits (i.e.  plutonic) to be unconventional. UDEPO considers resources associated with \nphosphate to be unconventio nal, and resources associated with lignite coal and black shale to be \nmostly unconventional , but with some notable exceptions to also be conventional (e.g.  some “high \ngrade” black shale deposits in Uzbekistan  are considered conventional for UDEPO). Other \ndiscrepancies also exist. So, there is no simple one -to-one correspondence between \nunconventional resources reported in the Red Book and unconventional resources recorded in the \nUDEPO database.  \nTherefore , uranium resources recorded in UDEPO represent optimi stic, maximum resource \namounts that have been identified and entered into the database to date (there are certainly more \ndeposits yet to be discovered). UDEPO should be used at an order -of-magnitude , aggregated , and \nglobal or continental scale. As such , deposit uranium resources and ore grades (where available) \nare provided only as ranges (e.g.  1-300 tU , 300-1 000 tU). Caution should be used when using \nUDEPO estimates , or making comparisons with uranium resources reported in the Red Book. \nFurther , on an individual basis, it is not recommended to use a deposit or small groups of deposits \nfor economic representations or comparisons.  \nGiven these caveats above , and using the UDEPO definition of “unconventional” , the latest \nversion of UDEPO (scheduled for rel ease in 2023) , which has over 5  200 deposits , reports about \n61 million  tU of unconventional resources in approximately 360 deposits (that have resource \namounts recorded) located in 55 countries. Conversely , using the Red Book definition of \n“unconventional” , UDEPO reports about 57 million tU in approximately 210 deposits (that have \nresource amounts recorded) in 53 countries. That represents a difference of 4 million tU , or 6.5%. \nAs indicated above , these estimates of unconventional resources derived from UDE PO should \nbe viewed with caution. A more reliable guide for unconventional resource totals of current \neconomic interest can be found in recent editions of the Red Book.  \nThis edition of the Red Book includes information for countries that: 1) have been prep aring \nto mine or are mining unconventional uranium resources , and maintain well -defined deposits as \npart of their conventional mineral resource inventory; 2) have well -defined unconventional \nuranium resources , and have firm plans for mining; 3) have nuclear power aspirations but have \nnot yet defined sufficient domestic conventional uranium resources, and are actively exploring \nunconventional resources; 4) have well -defined unconventional uranium resources that may be \namenable to mining; and 5) have unconventional uranium resource targets in their early exploration programmes.  \nCountries preparing to mine or currently mining unconventional uranium resources , and \nmaintaining well -defined deposits as part of their conventional mineral resource inventory:  \n• Austral ia – Although considered an important by- product of copper and gold mining at \nOlympic Dam , uranium has been produced for several years in what is here considered an \nunconventional uranium resource. However , the multi -metal Olympic Dam deposit is \nexceptiona l in size and uranium is routinely produced along with the primary targets of the \nmining operation , and is thus considered conventional by Australia.  \n• India  – Carbonate deposits form the largest part of India’s well explored uranium resources, \naccounting for over 57% of recoverable RAR (more than 122 000 tU , cost range unassigned) and \nare considered conventional resources by India. Strata bound carbonates have provided feed \nfor the Tummalapalle mill since 2017 , but because India does not publish information on \nURANIUM SUPPLY  \n44 URANIUM 2022: RESOURCES, PRODUCTI ON AND DEMAND, NEA No. 7634, © OECD 2023  uranium production and details of the deposits being mined , neither the grade of the deposits \nnor the total production from the mill are known.   \n• Kazakhstan  – Although estimates are not made of Kazakhstan’s unconventional uranium \nresources and other materials , the uranium contained in well explored phosphates and \nlignite coal deposits is considered a part , albeit small (<13% and <2% of the higher cost (<130 \nand <260  USD/kgU) recoverable RAR and IR) , of the country’s uranium resource base. \nBalausa LLP is developing by open pit the Bala -Sauskandykskoye deposit where uranium is \nproduced as a by -product of vanadium. A very small amount of ur anium -bearing ore , \ncontaining about 4 005 kgU , was mined and stockpiled during 2019 -2020.  \n• Russia  – Although only a small part of the country’s resource endowment (<4% and <3% of \nthe higher cost [<130 and <260 USD/kgU] RAR and IR) , phosphates are considere d \nconventional resources in Russia because uranium is the main commodity of interest.  \n• South Africa  – A significant unconventional resource base in paleo- quartz- pebble \nconglomerates and derived tailings and coal -hosted deposits has been reported in recent R ed \nBooks, all of which could be sources of by -product uranium. Uranium is hosted primarily by \ncoal (with minor amounts in the mudstones) in the Springbok Flats. In the 2016 edition of the \nRed Book , 70 775 tU in lignite and coal deposits were reported as in ferred in situ conventional \nresources. This is a good example of a reclassification of resources from unconventional to \nconventional. This reclassification is subjective since there are some parts of the definition of \nthese resource classes that are open t o different interpretations. In  addition , uranium \nproduction and resources from tailings is reported as conventional and in association with \nthe paleo -quartz- pebble conglomerate deposit type.  \nAs reported in the 2011 edition of the Red Book , a field of man ganiferous phosphate nodules \nwas identified off the west and south -west coast of South Africa on the continental shelf. The \nnodules contain low grades of uranium and are currently considered uneconomic with \nrespect to both phosphate and uranium extraction.  Renewed interest in phosphate -hosted \nuranium deposits, however , may generate future investigation. These unconventional \nresources have been previously estimated to contain up to 180  000 tU.  \n• Uzbekistan  – Several black shale type uranium deposits  were identified during the 1960s in \nthe Auminzatau Mountains district. Although resources of individual deposits are relatively small and low grade (0.02 to 0.13% U; averaging 0.05% U) , uranium resources in well explored \nblack shales amount to <4% and 40%  respectively of the higher cost (<130 and <260 USD/kgU) \nRAR and IR uranium resource endowment. Black shale deposits in Uzbekistan are estimated to contain almost 33 000 tU of recoverable IR uranium resources.  \nIn August 2009, GoscomGeology (Uzbekistan’s State Geology and Mineral Resources \nCommittee) and the China Guangdong Nuclear Uranium Corp. (CGN -URC) , set up a 50% -50% \nuranium exploration joint venture to focus on uranium extraction from black shale deposits \nin the Boztau area of the Central Kyzylkum D esert in the Navoi region , where approximately \n5 500 tU resources have been reported. From 2011 to 2013, CGN -URC was to develop \ntechnology for producing uranium and vanadium from these deposits , but no activities \nhave been reported since that time. Given r ecent low uranium prices , development of \nUzbekistan’s black shale deposits has been indefinitely delayed.  \nCountries with well -defined unconventional uranium resources and firm plans for mining:  \n• Brazil  – The Santa Quitéria phosphate/uranium project , an INB -Brazilian fertiliser producer \npartnership agreement , remains under development. The deposit is estimated to contain over \n50 000 tU in situ RAR available at an incremental cost of <USD  40/kgU , just under 40% of the \ncountry’s well explored uranium endowment . Santa Quitéria’s phosphates are also higher \ngrade (0.08% U) than most phosphate deposits. At full production , the Santa Quitéria Project \ncould produce close to 1 950 tU/yr.  \n \n URANIUM SUPPLY  \nURANIUM 2022: RESOURCES, PRODUCTION AND DEMAND, NEA No. 7634, © OECD 2023  45 The licensing of the Santa Quitéria phosphate/uranium project is split into a non -nuclear part , \ninvolving milling and phosphate production , and a nuclear part , involving uranium \nconcentrate production. In 2012 , the project operators applied for a construction licence that \nwas denied in 2018. INB and its partner subsequently developed a new model for the project \nand a revised licence application was filed in 2020 , with a decision expected in 2022. The \noperation is now scheduled to begin in 2024.  \n• Denmark (Greenland)  – The Ilimaussaq igneous complex of South Greenland hosts the REE -\nU-Zn-F Kvanefjeld deposit. It is a high -tonnage , low-grade uranium -enriched layered \nintrusive deposit , with concentrations of around 300  ppm U (0.03% U). Uranium was planned \nto be mined (see below) as a by -product from a proposed open -pit mine , accounting for ab out \n5% of total revenue from the mining. Kvanefjeld is the only uranium deposit or occurrence in \nGreenland with reasonably assured uranium resources. The supply cost for uranium was \nexpected to be very low , as most of the costs were to be borne by the prod uction of REE , the \nprimary mining target (Kvanefjeld is considered to be one of the largest REE deposits in the world). A uranium specific supply cost of approximately USD  13/kgU (USD 5/lb U\n3O8) has been \nreported , which is incremental to the cost of the RE E production.  \nThe total identified in situ reasonably assured conventional mineral resource inventory for \nKvanefjeld is 102 820 tU. Additional in situ inferred mineral resources of 125  143 tU are \nrelated to the Kvanefjeld deposit. The recoverable uranium r esources  using the established \nand pilot plant tested flowsheet are approximately 50%.  \nDevelopment of mining has taken several years , in part related to issues associated with \nuranium mining in a jurisdiction that has never produced uranium , complicated by  a \nprevious ban on uranium mining and the need for both Greenland and Denmark to agree to all legislative and regulatory requirements for uranium mining and export. This has been \nfurther complicated by an April 2021 election in Greenland that led to a chan ge in \ngovernment that passed a new law prohibiting exploration and exploitation of uranium as \nof December 2021. Passage of this new law led the project developer , Greenland Minerals \nLtd., to request arbitration proceedings with the governments of Greenland  and Denmark \nconcerning the impact of new legislation on its exploration licence for the Kvanefjeld REE \nzinc and uranium project under development in southern Greenland.  \n• Finland  – A 2020 resource update from project operator Terrafame Oy estimated that in situ \nunconventional resources of uranium in the Talvivaara black schist -hosted Ni -Zn-Cu-Co \ndeposit total approximately 19 400  tU at an average grade of 0.0017%  U in the measured and \nindicated resources of 1 142  Mt, and about 25 500 tU at an average grade o f 0.0017%  U in the \ntotal mineral resources (measured , indicated and inferred) of 1 500 Mt.  \nBetween 2010 and 2015, Talvivaara Sotkamo Oy prepared for uranium recovery as a by-\nproduct from the Talvivaara deposit in Sotkamo , eastern Finland. The Talvivaara N i-Zn-Cu-\nCo deposit is hosted by metamorphosed black shales in the Kainuu Schist Belt. It is a low -\ngrade , large -tonnage deposit averaging 0.26  wt% Ni , 0.53 wt% Zn , 0.14 wt% Cu , 0.02 wt% Co \nand 0.0017 wt% U.  \nIn 2012, the Finnish government granted a uranium extraction licence to Talvivaara \nSotkamo Oy in accordance with the nuclear energy legislation. In 2013 , however , the \nSupreme Administrative Court returned the licence to the Finnish government for \nreassessment due to several changes in the operations after the licensing decision , \nincluding a corporate reorganisation. Talvivaara Sotkamo Oy then filed for bankruptcy in \n2014. The state -owned company Terrafame Oy acquired the operations and assets of \nTalvivaara Sotkamo Oy from its bankruptcy estate in 2015 , and as of 1  January 2021, was \ncarrying on the mining operations in Sotkamo.  \nIn 2017, Terrafame Oy applied to the Finnish government for a licence to recover uranium as \na by -product at Terrafame’s mine in Sotkamo , in accordance with the nuclear energy \nlegislation. In February 2020 , the Finnish government granted a uranium extraction licence to \nTerrafame. However , this licence was appealed to the Supreme Administrative Court. In June \n2021, the Supreme Administrative Court confirmed the uranium extraction licen ce that had \nbeen previously granted by the government. The mine site in Sotkamo currently includes an \nURANIUM SUPPLY  \n46 URANIUM 2022: RESOURCES, PRODUCTI ON AND DEMAND, NEA No. 7634, © OECD 2023  almost fully completed uranium solvent extraction plant from the time of Terrafame’s \npredecessor , Talvivaara Sotkamo Oy. Terrafame expects to start uraniu m production in \nSotkamo in 2024, principally to remove uranium impurities from the Ni -Co sulphide \nconcentrate before refining , once the economic feasibility of uranium recovery has been \nestablished and the investment decision has been finalised , along with  final plant design , \nproject implementation , deployment and start -up of the uranium solvent extraction plant.  \nCountries with nuclear power aspirations that have not yet defined sufficient conventional \nuranium resources , and are actively exploring unconvent ional resources:  \n• Jordan  – In 1982, a feasibility study for uranium extraction from phosphoric acid was \ncompleted by a German engineering company on behalf of the Jordan Fertiliser Industry \nCompany , leading to the subsequent purchase by the Jordan Phosphate  Mines Company. \nOne of the extraction processes evaluated was originally found to be economically feasible , \nbut as uranium prices dropped in the 1990s , the process became uneconomic, and \nconstruction of an extraction plant was deferred.  \nAfter SNC -Lavalin performed a technological and economic feasibility study for the recovery \nof uranium from the phosphoric acid produced at the Aqaba Fertilizer Complex , the \neconomics of the project improved and JUMCO conducted research to develop optimised \nextraction param eters , with promising results. Jordan’s phosphate deposits are estimated \nto contain some 100 000 tU in situ but , due to limited exploration , are not yet considered \nclassified resources.  \n• Malawi  – In the Kanyika Niobium Project held by Globe Metals , uranium is an important by -\nproduct in the complex niobium and tantalum ore in a pegmatite quartz vein, hosted in \nProterozoic felsic schists. Niobium and tantalum products would be produced with uranium as by -product. As of December 2012, total resources amount to 68.3  Mt of ore at an average \ngrade of 0.28%  Nb\n2O5, 0.0135%  Ta2O5 and 0.0067%  U (4  550 tU). Globe Metals & Mining \nsubmitted an environmental impact assessment (EIA) for the Kanyika Niobium Project for public review in May 2012. In January 2019 , Globe Metals  announced that it had finalised \nthe feasibility study , including revision of the mineral resource estimates , mining , \nmetallurgical studies , processing , engineering design and infrastructural support. It \nobtained updated capital and operating cost estimate s and updated its financial model. \nHowever , Globe Metals is not yet in a position to finalise the financial model and the key \noutcomes of the project , due to the current uncertainty associated with the status of the \nmining law in Malawi, and to the status of negotiations between Globe Metals and the \ngovernment on the Development Agreement.  \n• Saudi Arabia  – An exploration programme was initiated  in 2017 to develop domestic mineral \nresources in line with Saudi Arabia’s Vision 2030 goal to have a mining sector that contributes \nto the national economy and to develop sufficient domestic uranium resources to fuel its \nplanned nuclear power programme. A s a result of this exploration programme , uranium \ndeposits and prospects have been reported as in situ inferred unconventional resources, \nincluding uranium resources associated with Nb , Zr, REE, Ta + Th , in peralkaline granite and \npegmatite in the Ghurayya h and Jabal Sayid areas , and uranium associated with phosphate \nhorizons. Total in situ unconventional uranium resources amount to 77  731 tU , including \n63 171 tU associated with the intrusive plutonic deposit type and 14  560 tU associated with \nthe phosphori te type.  \nPhosphorite deposits in the Sirhan -Turayf shelf in northern Saudi Arabia form part of the \nlarge North African Middle East Tethyan phosphate province , which stretches from Morocco \nto Iraq. The Thaniyat phosphorite member at the base of Jalamid Form ation of late Cretaceous \n(Campanian) to Paleocene age , was deposited in a shallow marine shelf to intertidal zone. The \nuraniferous phosphorite layer extends continuously within a target area of about 70 km\n2 and \nhas an average thickness of 1.8  m, with an average density of 2.0 g/cm3. The IR in situ resource \nis estimated to total 14 551 tU and the current resource is severely uneconomic.  \n URANIUM SUPPLY  \nURANIUM 2022: RESOURCES, PRODUCTION AND DEMAND, NEA No. 7634, © OECD 2023  47 Countries with well -defined unconventional uranium resources that may be amenable to mining:  \n• Central African Republic  – While the Bakouma uranium deposit is associated with \nphosphates and the country does not report unconventional resources , it is classified as a \nconventional deposit because of relatively high uranium grades (0.15 -0.30% U). In its 2020 \nAnnual Report , Orano (the current owner of the project) reported the results of a new \nresource evaluation that estimates IR in  situ resources  of 36  475 tU available at \n<USD  260/kgU at an average grade of 0.20 % U. The start -up of the Bakouma pilot project  was \ninitially planned for 2010 , with open -pit mining initially producing 1  200 tU/yr and \n2 000 tU/yr at full capacity. The uranium mining project was , however , suspended at the \nend of 2011 for one to two years due to low uranium prices and the need for further research \non the metallurgy.  \n• Chile – The production of copper oxide minerals has quadrupled in Chile over the last decade \nand the copper industry, particularly large -scale mining , has strategic (sub -economic) \nuranium potential in the large volumes of copper oxide leaching solutions that could be \nrecovered. These resources are assigned an in  situ potential of 1  000 tU. However , no \nbackground studies have been performed to confirm these estimates , eithe r as mining \nresources or in terms of the volumes of solutions treated annually.   \nOver the last decade , private firms , both domestic and foreign , have explored 12  “exotic \ncopper” deposits in Chile , essentially paleochannels filled with gravel, mineralised with \ncopper silicates, oxides and sulphates primarily as a result of the natural leaching of porphyry \ncopper deposits. These mineralised bodies contain variable uranium contents ranging between 7 to 116 ppm (0.007 to 0.016%  U). The leaching solutions in th e plants that treat these \ncopper oxide minerals contain up to 10  ppm U that is technically recoverable using ion -\nexchange resins at a likely production cost of over USD  80/kgU. A pilot -level trial, conducted \nbetween 1976 and 1979, obtained about 0.5  tU fro m copper -rich solutions containing 10 to \n15 ppm  U (0.001 to 0.0015%  U). \nBeyond this trial , there has been no experience in recovering uranium from phosphorites in \nChile. The only deposit currently being worked is Bahía Inglesa in Region III (Atacama) , whic h \nproduces a solid phosphate concentrate used directly as fertiliser. In 2001 , Compañía Minera \nde Fosfatos Naturales Ltda. (Bifox Ltda.) began producing phosphoric acid from this deposit , \nopening the potential of recovering uranium from the acid.  \nIdentifie d unconventional recoverable RAR amount to 1  169 tU (<USD 260/kgU) , including \n415 tU in phosphates , while undiscovered unconventional resources are estimated to total \n5 458 tU.  \nCountries with unconventional uranium resource targets in their early exploration programmes:  \n• Ecuador  – Early exploration activities included the examination of  the Puyango sedimentary \ndeposit (V , Zn, U, Cu, Pb), where tabular -shaped uranium mineralisation is hosted by the \nEarly Cretaceous Puyango Unit , which consists of black limestone , bituminous limestone and \ncalcareous sandstone. This deposit may be considered a potential source of U , where this \nmetal may be recovered as minor co - or by -product to other metals. However , no \nassessment of uranium resources and processing techn ologies has been carried out. Further \nsouth in the Alamor -Lancones basin , the Maastrichtian Cazaderos Formation consisting of \nmedium grained sandstones , black shales and siltstones could also host uranium \noccurrences.  \n• Egypt – Phosphate deposits represent o ne of the more promising unconventional uranium \nresources , with estimates suggesting that they amount to about 700 million tonnes , with \nuranium content ranging between 50 ppm and 200 ppm (0.005 -0.02% U). However , no \nreliable estimate of the uranium resourc es in Egyptian phosphate ores has been made since \n2008, when it was reported in the 2009 Red Book that up to 42 000 tU may be contained in \nEgyptian phosphates.  \nURANIUM SUPPLY  \n48 URANIUM 2022: RESOURCES, PRODUCTI ON AND DEMAND, NEA No. 7634, © OECD 2023  Black sands are considered the second most important unconventional source of uranium \nin Egypt.  Radioactive monazite comprises one of the black sand ore minerals and is \nestimated to contain about 6 million tonnes of heavy minerals. In one area , the monazite \ncontains up to 0.5% U and 6% Th , as well as rare earth elements (REE).  \nFrom 1999 to 2003, Egypt worked on the development of a semi -pilot plant for the extraction \nof uranium from phosphoric acid , but unexpected technical problems delayed uranium \nproduction. The project was suspended due to challenges related to the low uranium content \nof the phos phoric acid and difficulties in the extraction cycle. The semi- pilot plant for the \npurification of phosphoric acid has since been converted to produce phosphoric acid for agricultural , food and other domestic purposes, and the country has returned to the \ndevelopment of conventional sources of uranium.  \n• Indonesia  – The uranium resource potential in the Bangka and Belitung areas is comprised of \nplacer deposits of monazite within a tin deposit. Monazite , a uranium/thorium phosphate \nmineral , was deposited in the  alluvium and has mostly accumulated as a tailings by -product \nmaterial of tin mining. The total resource from deposits in Bangka and Belitung islands amounts to 25 236 tU. In Singkep , the uranium potential is in lateritic soil, with a resource of \n1 100 tU. In Semelangan (West Kalimantan) , uranium is present in bauxite lateritic deposits, \nwith resources of 624 tU. In Katingan (Central Kalimantan) , monazite is present as a by -\nproduct material of zircon mining , with resources of 485 tU. Total unconventional monazite \nresources are therefore estimated to amount to 27 445 tU , with about 100  000 tU contained in \nIndonesian phosphate deposits. However , no effort has yet been made to develop uranium \nextraction technologies from these unconventional deposits.  \n• Mexico  – The San Juan de la Costa phosphorite deposit is estimated to contain significant \nuranium resources , but no systematic evaluation of the contained uranium or the optimal \nprocessing method to extract the uranium has been conducted.  \n• Nepal  – Early exploration efforts led to the determination that the most important phosphate \noccurrence in Nepal is the Baitadi Carbonate Formation in the Lesser Himalaya of Far East \nNepal. The phosphate -rich horizon of middle Proterozoic age (1 200 to 1 000 Ma), confined to \nthe stromatolitic Massive Cherty Dolomite member among seven lithological members, \nextends laterally over more than 25  km with thickness varying from a few metres to 18  m. \nThe P\n2O5 content varies from 10 to 32 wt%. Neither the average phosphate nor uranium \ncontent of the occurrence has been determined , prohibiting the evaluation of the economic \npotential of the Baitadi Formation.  \nCoal occurrences in Nepal are found in four stratigraphic horizons: Quaternary lignite of the Kathmandu valley, Siwalik coal of the S ub Himalayas/Churia Range , Eocene coal of the \nWestern and mid -Western Nepal , and Gondwana coal. Although the uranium content of \nthese horizons is unknown, the lignite horizon in the Kathmandu valley may have \nsignificant uranium contents owing to the presen ce of uranium showings in the gneissic \nmuscovite -tourmaline granites and pegmatites north of Kathmandu city. Only the \nQuaternary lignite of the Kathmandu valley and the Eocene coal has been mined for domestic needs. The resources from the Quaternary lignit e and the Eocene are quite limited \nand even if they were relatively rich in U , its recovery will not be of economic interest. \nHowever , due to the presence of U -rich orthogneisses surrounding the Kathmandu \ndepression , it is likely that these lignites are si gnificantly enriched in U.  \nBlack shales also occur in various parts of Nepal, but they are generally metamorphosed and \ndeformed , and their uranium content is not known. The probability of having significant \nuranium resources in this type of lithology is limited given the present state of knowledge.  \n• Peru  – Unconventional resources in Peru account for a minimum of 41  600 tU in situ , which \ninclude phosphates (16 000 tU) , granites with high uranium content (20 000 tU) and \nhydrothermal deposits (5 600 tU).   \n \n URANIUM SUPPLY  \nURANIUM 2022: RESOURCES, PRODUCTION AND DEMAND, NEA No. 7634, © OECD 2023  49 In 2010 , the Vale company (formerly Vale do Rio Doce) of Brazil started exploitation of the \nBayóvar phosphate deposit through its local subsidiary , Miski Mayo SRL. Before the start of \nthe operation the company planned for the possibility of uranium recovery during \nphosphate production , but these plans have not yet been implemented.  \n• Sri Lanka  – Sri Lanka reported in the Red Book 2020 that a current focus of its early work on \nnational fissile material development was to identify radioactive mineralisation in t he \ncountry with an emphasis on the extraction of uranium from unconventional sources. \nThrough IAEA technical co -operation projects , a substantial amount of technical assistance \nwas provided to Sri Lanka for the discovery of economic uranium and thorium mineralisation , but no resource determinations have been reported.  \nVarying concentrations of heavy mineral sands (ilmenite , rutile , garnet , zircon , monazite) \noccur in the beach sands of the country. However , only certain locations have \nconcentrations that are  deemed sufficient for potential economic exploitation. From 2016 \nto 2019, four new areas of anomalous radioactivity were identified in the coastal stretch \nfrom Talaimannar to Galle. Fieldwork from Talaimannar to Kudiramalai was completed in 2017 and conti nued to Puttalam to the end of 2019. Follow -up work is anticipated. Monazite -\nrich beach sand placer deposits are known to occur along the coastal stretch covering the \nAluthgama -Beruwala -Induruwa southwest sector and the Kudiramalai northwest sector of \nthe island. Notable amounts of thorianite -rich sands are reported in beach sands in the \nBeruwala -Induruwa areas. Monazite and thorianite sands are reported to occur in lesser \nconcentrations within the Pulmuddai , Thirukkovil and Galle mineral sand occurrences. \nUrano -thorianite deposits also occur in river placers (southwest). Monazite concentrations \nof 0.3 -1% are known to occur in approximately 75 million tonnes of inland REE deposits \n(northwest). Monazite -bearing beach mineral samples collected from the east co ast \nPulmoddai Deposit were processed to separate monazite and analyse for trace elements by \nAEB laboratories. The analysis revealed values up to 23% Ce in monazite. Geophysical \nsurveys for near offshore minerals in southwest Sri Lanka identified an estimat ed volume \nof sediments of 170 million tonnes in 11 potential basins to a depth of 2 metres. Monazite \nconcentrations of up to 1.1% were estimated based on gamma -ray spectrometry analysis.  \n• Viet Nam  – Uranium exploration activities associated with rare earth element ores (Dong \nPao bastnaesites , Namxe bastnaesite , YenPhu xenotime and beach sand monazite , etc.) are \nbeing conducted , but resource determinations stemming from these efforts have yet to be \nreported. Research focused on the recovery of thorium and ura nium from rare earth \nconcentrates has been undertaken , and a continuous counter -current extraction process \nfor the simultaneous recovery of thorium and uranium from the Yen Phu rare earth concentrate leach solutions was developed by the Institute for Techn ology of Radioactive \nand Rare Elements. Results show that the extraction method is suitable for the recovery of thorium and uranium from rare earth concentrate with thorium and uranium purities of greater than 99%.   \nIn summary , unconventional uranium deposits remain an important part of the global \nuranium endowment and in some countries mining is already underway or planned. However , \nfor many of the unconventional deposits discussed above , sufficient exploration has not yet \nbeen conducted to develop hi gh confidence resource estimates and costs of production remain \ntoo high for commercial production in today’s market. Moreover , licensing for mining some of \nthese deposits has proven challenging , particularly in jurisdictions that have not recently or \nhave  never mined uranium, since licensing involves both radiological (nuclear) and non -\nradiological components. Development of mines that extract uranium as a co-  or by -product \nalso depends on the primary mining target(s) , markets , and the fortunes of the comp anies \nconducting the mining , which may have little experience with uranium. However , if uranium \ndemand and prices rise to near historic highs , or if demand for REE , lithium and other \nco-occurring targets of interest rise even further , unconventional uraniu m resources could once \nagain contribute more significant quantities of uranium to the global market.  \nURANIUM SUPPLY  \n50 URANIUM 2022: RESOURCES, PRODUCTI ON AND DEMAND, NEA No. 7634, © OECD 2023  Seawater  \nThe world’s oceans have long been regarded as a possible source of uranium because of the \nlarge amount of contained uranium (over 4  billion  tU) an d its inexhaustible nature. However , \nbecause seawater contains such low concentrations of uranium (3 -4 parts per billion) , \ndeveloping a cost -effective method of extraction remains a challenge.  \nResearch on uranium recovery from seawater was carried out ini tially from the 1950s to the \n1980s in  Germany , Italy, the United  Kingdom  and the United  States . From 1981 to 1988, the \nAgency for Natural Resources and Energy , the Ministry of International Trade and Industry, and \nthe Metal Mining Agency of Japan  teamed up  to operate an experimental marine uranium \nadsorption plant based on TiO 2 adsorbents.   \nA renewal of interest in the last 15 years led to a special issue of the Journal of Industrial \nand Engineering Chemical Research devoted to the recovery of uranium from seawater (ACS , \n2016). One of the leading methods considered for extracting uranium from seawater at that time \ninvolved infusing fibres made of polyethylene , a common plastic , with amidoxime , a chemical \ngroup pioneered by Japanese researchers in the 1980s that attracts uranium dioxide and binds it to the fibre (Kuo et al. , 2016; Abney et al. , 2017). Researchers at the Pacific Northwest National \nLaboratory and LCW Supercritical Technologies subsequently produced five grams of yellowcake using this method (PN NL, 2018). This and other developments are estimated to have \nreduced the cost of uranium extraction from seawater by a factor of three to four based on laboratory experience (CNA , 2016; PNNL, 2016).  \nResearchers at Stanford University subsequently develope d an electrochemical method to \ncapture uranium from seawater, demonstrating a nine -fold increase in uranium capacity, a four -\nfold faster rate of uranium accumulation , and favourable reusability compared to the best \nadsorbent materials developed for the sam e purpose (Abate , 2017; Liu et al. , 2017). The application \nof carbon nanotube technology to extract uranium from seawater was also investigated , owing to \nthe high surface area of the material for adsorption and its rapid ion transport capability (Ahmad et al., 2020; Zhao et al. , 2019). However , finding a simple method to prepare the new carbon \nstructure proved challenging.  \nTo overcome bio- fouling on wet sorbent surfaces, a guanidine and amidoxime polypropylene \nnon- woven fabric was developed that showed improved selectivity and anti -fouling performance , \nthereby accelerating the rate of uranium sorption (Zhang et al. , 2018). Poly phenylacetylene \nconductive chains incorporated into the porous adsorbent channels as a pathway for ion transportation by electrically driven motility achieved a record uptake capacity of uranium in a 90-day test using natural seawater (Wang et al. , 2020) , although low uranium seawater \nconcentrations and interfering ions reduced overall efficiency. “Pre -enriching” uranium content \nin se awater was experimentally achieved through development of a glycerine cross -linked \ngraphene oxide -based membrane that effectively captured co -existing ions (K\n+, Na+, Ca2+ and Mg2+) \nwhile rejecting approximately 100% of the uranium (Chu et al. , 2022).  \nA reu sable bioinspired film with extremely small pores that adsorbs uranyl ions rapidly \nthrough hierarchical (increasingly smaller) porous channels increased adsorption capacity up to 20 times (Zhang , 2021). Importantly , the film can be cleaned with HCl for reu se (Sparkes , 2021). \nCalcium carbonate mesospheres synthesised by nanoemulsion to produce interconnected mesospheres of high surface area showed high rates of uranium adsorption that was easily recovered after adsorption by dissolution of the mesospheres in  acid (Dongsheng et al. , 2022). \nInspired by the high uranium content in natural marine carapaces , tests using the crystalline \ncalcium carbonate in ground crab carapace achieved high uranium extraction capacities (Feng et. al., 2022).  \nThese and other techniques have been recently investigated in what has become an active \narea of research , particularly in China . While each resulted in an improvement in both the \ncapture and recovery of uranium from seawater, it is important to note that these are laboratory \ntests only. Development of an industrial scale method of extracting uranium from seawater , \neven with the bench scale improvements recently demonstrated , will need to overcome several \nchallenges , including the vast amounts of seawater that would need to be processed , ecological \n URANIUM SUPPLY  \nURANIUM 2022: RESOURCES, PRODUCTION AND DEMAND, NEA No. 7634, © OECD 2023  51 concerns potentially arising from such a process , and production costs that remain significantly \nabove market prices. However , should an economical method be developed , it would be the \nultimate low -impact method of producing uranium , bolstering the low -carbon standing of \nnuclear power and dispensing with any concerns of uranium shorta ges, should nuclear power \nexperience rapid growth.   \nUranium exploration  \nNon-domestic  \nOnly four countries (China, France , Japan  and Russia ) have reported non -domestic exploration \nand development expenditures since 2008, and this was reduced to three countries in this edition \nas China did not report (Table  1.14). Non -domestic expenditures are a subset of domestic \n(i.e. within country) expenditures as the totals reported on a country -by-country basis are a total \nof expenditures from both domestic and foreign sources within each country. The recent trend in \nnon- domestic exploration and development expenditures is depicted in Figure 1.4. During this \nreporting per iod, non- domestic expenditures declined from USD  142.9 million in 2017 to \nUSD 75.7 million in 2018 , USD 56.8 million in 2019 and USD  39.2 million in 2020. They are expected \nto increase to USD  70.7 million in 2021 (preliminary data). In this edition , non- domestic \nexploration and development expenditures reported by France  and Japan declined from 2019 to \n2021, likely due to poor market conditions, whereas expenditures by Russia increased \nconsiderably in 2020 and 2021 as exploration and mine development activi ties continued in \nNamibia , Kazakhstan and Tanzania, raising non -domestic expenditures by Russia  to levels not \nseen since 2012.  \nTable 1.14.

Trends in exploration and development expenditures  \n \n* 2021 values are estimates.  \nSeveral countries do not report non -domestic expenditures or have not reported these \nexpenditures recently , and thus the data are incomplete. Private companies in Canada and \nAustralia  are known to make non- domestic investments and are likely leading investors in foreign \nuranium exploration and development activities, but no information has been reported by these \ngovernments for the past several years.  \nDomestic  \nTwenty -one countries reported domestic exploration and mine development expenditures for this \nedition (Table 1.15). The totals reported are on a country -by-country basis and represent the total \nexpenditures from both domestic and foreign sources within each country. The recent tre nd in \ndomestic exploration and development expenditures is depicted in Figure 1.4. As in the previous \nreport , the overall picture is one of declining expenditures since 2015 with total expenditures \ndropping by 71% from over USD  876.5 million in 2015 to USD  251.3 million in 2020. However , \nexpenditures were expected to increase slightly to USD  277.4 million in 2021 , despite China, one \nof the leading countries in exploration and development expenditures in recent years, not \nreporting expenses in 2020 or 2021. From 2015 to 2020, decreased expenditures in many countries \nwere related to persistently low uranium prices that slowed exploration and mine development projects.  \nOf the 19 countries reporting exploration and mine development expenditures in the period \n2019 through 2021 (seven of these reporting only two years or less), the total over this three -year \nperiod amounts to just over USD 1 billion.  Canada (USD 505.5 million , or 50.0% of the total) led the \nway, followed by India (USD 179.2 million , 17.7%) , China (USD 154 million or 15.2%; with only 2019 \nexpenditures reported) , Kazakhstan (USD 42 million , 4.2%) , Namibia  (USD  36.2 million , 3.6%) , \nRussia  (USD 32.4 million , 3.2%) , Türkiye  (USD 21.5 million , 2.1%; with 2021 expenditures not \nreported) , Australia  (USD 18.6 million , 1.8%) , Saudi  Arabia  (USD  12.8 million , 1.3%; reporting \nuranium exploration expenditures for the first time), and Jordan  (USD  8.8 million , 0.9%). \nExpenditures in  Canada alone exceeded the total spending of the eight countries ranked second \nto ninth ( India, China, Kazakhstan, Namibia , Russia , Türkiye , Australia  and Saudi  Arabia ), \ndemonstrating once again that Canada (mainly the Athabasca Basin) remains the prime \ndestination for uranium exploration.   0 5001 0001 5002 0002 500\n2004 2005 2006 2007 2008 2009 2010 2011 2012 2013 2014 2015 2016 2017 2018 2019 2020 2021*USD (millions, current)\nYearDomestic\nNon-domestic\n URANIUM SUPPLY  \nURANIUM 2022: RESOURCES, PRODUCTION AND DEMAND, NEA No. 7634, © OECD 2023  53 Table 1.15.

Generally increasing expenditures over this same period were reported by the Czech  \nRepublic  (USD 197 000 to USD 289 000) , Egypt  (USD 90 000 to USD 254 000) and Namibia  \n(USD  6 million to USD 19.2 million). Exploration and mine development expenditures were \nrelatively steady from 2019 to 2021 in Australia  (~ USD 6.2 million), Canada (~USD 170 million), \nIndia (~USD 60 million), Jordan  (~USD 2.9 million), Russia  (~USD 11 million), Spain  (~USD  500 000) \nand Ukraine  (~USD 2.5 million). Finland  reported exploration expenditures for 2014; however , from \n2015 onwards , there is no data for Finland  as it is not possible to separate uranium exploration \nexpenditures from the total reported for gold exploration , in which uranium is a potential co - or \nby-product. Due to very low values and confidentiality concerns , no expenditures were reported \nfor the United  States  from 2018 to 2021; expenditures ha ve been in dramatic decline since 2012 \nwhen exploration and mine development expenditures amounted to USD 166 million , compared \nto USD 44.3 million in 2017 , a decrease of 73%.  \nGlobal exploration and mine development expenditures were expected to increase in 2021 to \nUSD 277.4 million , a 10% increase compared to 2020, although the increase is likely greater since \n2021 expenditures were not reported for key countries such as China,  Niger , Türkiye  and Zambia . \nIncreases in expenditure from 2020 to 2021 are, however , expected in important uranium \nproducing countries, such as Australia , Canada, India, Namibia  and Ukraine . For the 2019 to 2021 \nperiod , of the countries that reported exploration and development expenditures separately , \nCanada and Kazakhstan report ed greater exploration than mine development expenditures \n(except for Kazakhstan in 2021) , whereas Ukraine reported greater mine development than \nexploration expenditures.  \nFor the first time in this edition of the Red Book , a table summarising recent glob al drilling \nactivities is included (although not comprehensive nor complete). Fifteen countries reported \ndrilling activities, although nine reported only partially (i.e.  some years or entities involved in \nexploration and/or mine development activities were  not reported). Data from four countries are \nincluded from the previous edition of the Red Book to round out data for 2018 and 2019 in order \nto give a more complete picture (Table 1.16). For the countries reporting data , total drilling declined \nby 42% from  2018 (2 633 128 m) to 2021 (1 100 934 m), although the number of countries providing \ndata declined from 15 to 10 over these same years. For the countries reporting exploration and development drilling meterage separately , development drilling accounted for 19% of total drilling \nin 2018, 15% in 2019, 28% in 2020 and 47% in 2021, although the number of countries reporting \ndevelopment drilling declined from 5 in 2018 to 3 in 2021. Note that the separate totals for \nexploration and development do not always add  up to the total metres drilled as the United  States  \ndoes not report this information separately and drilling data for India and Russia  were not \nseparated into exploration and development. Also noteworthy is that drilling data for Canada  \nwere not available  in 2020 and 2021 and that the United  States  has not provided data since 2017 , \nowing to very low values and confidentiality concerns. Despite these gaps, the reported global \ndrilling effort has not only declined since the last reporting period , but it has also been in decline \nsince 2012, when 17 countries reported drilling that totalled 5  368 268 m in the 2016 edition of the \nRed Book.  \nIn terms of exploration drilling distance from 2018 to 2021 , most countries reported irregular \ntrends as COVID -19 work restrictions disrupted drilling plans and several countries did not report \ndrilling distance in each year. Of the countries that reported drilling for each year , Namibia  and \nEgypt  were the only countries reporting upward trends in exploration drilling , although drilling in \nNamibia  was significantly greater than that reported for Egypt . Kazakhstan and Ukraine  reported \ndeclining drilling distance while India reported relatively steady drilling length in each year. In \ncontrast , Argentina and Russia  reported va riable drilling distance.  \nOf the countries reporting exploration and development drillin g data for all four years \n(2018- 2021) , Kazakhstan accounted for between 27% -65% of global drilling distance , India between \n10%-25%, Namibia  1%-8%, Ukraine  1%-8%, Argen tina and Egypt  <1% (note that 2018 data from the \nprevious edition of this publication were included for Namibia  and Ukraine ). Percentages for these \ncountries were generally highest in 2020 and 2021 since Canada and China did not report \nexploration drilling  distance in these years.

Kazakhstan  dominated development drilling  \nlength in all four years, from 44% in 2018 to 70% in 2019, 95% and 96% in 2020 and 2021, \nrespectively. Namibia  and Ukraine  accounted for between 2% and 5% of total global \ndevelopment drilling in each year, with the exception of Ukraine  reporting 41% of to tal \ndevelopment drilling in 2018, while Egypt ’s development drilling amounted to <1% in each year \nbetween 2018 and 2021.  \nTrenching data, reported only by Argentina  (2018 and 2021 only), Egypt , Iran (2018 and 2019 \nonly),  Jordan  (2018 only) and Saudi Arabia  (2018 and 2019 only), totalled over 10 500 m \n(1 851 trenches) in 2018, 2 229 m (65 trenches) in 2019 and 330  m (14 trenches) in 2020 ( Egypt  \nonly), with 600  m (40 trenches) expected in 2021 ( Argentina  and Egypt  only). In 2018, Iran  and \nJordan  accounted for over 90% of the global total trenching length. In 2019, Iran  accounted for \n67% of the global total.

This dominance continues despite the United States  not reporting \nexploration and mine develo pment expenditures since 2017 and Mexico  not reporting since 2019.  \nCanada, despite the global trend of declining exploration and development expenditures , \nhas maintained higher than average expenditures and in 2020 accounted for 56% of the world \ntotal  for countries reporting this data. Total Canadian uranium exploration and development \nexpenditures in 2019 amounted to USD 210.7 million , a 6% increase from 2018. This ended a \nseries of expenditure declines since 2013 (USD  845.1 million) but was short -lived , as \nexpenditures slid to USD 140.9 million in 2020 , with USD 153.9 million expected in 2021. \nUranium development expenditures declined from CAD 253 million in 2016 to CAD 114 million \nin 2019 and CAD 105 million in 2020, comprising about 60% to 46% of total e xpenditures in these \nyears , respectively. This decrease and the 45% decrease in exploration expenditures (from \nCAD  170 million in 2018 to CAD 88 million in 2020) is primarily due to work -related COVID -19 \npandemic restrictions and low uranium prices.  \n \nBox 1.1. SABRE mining method  \nSABRE (Surface Access Borehole Resource Extraction)  is an innovative and scalable mining method that \ncan allow for the exploitation of relatively small high -grade orebodies that are either too small or too \ndeep to be mined economic ally by open -pit and (or) underground mining methods. It is a surface- based, \nnon -human -entry method that uses a single high -pressure water jet placed at the bottom of a drill hole \nto excavate a mining cavity . An access hole is drilled to an orebody and a h igh-pressure fluid injection \ntool is then lowered down the hole on a specialised mining string to disaggregate the ore material and \nform a subsurface cavity. The ore material is optionally ground to a desired size by a drill bit and is air-\nlifted as a slur ry through production tubing to the surface for further processing. The injection and \ngrinding tools are optimally part of an integrated bottom -hole assembly at the lowermost end of a drill \nstring. The bottom -hole assembly also includes surveying equipment  to measure the cavity dimensions \nat intervals during excavation, thus allowing fluid injection adjustments to achieve a desired cavity \ngeometry and dimension. Adjacent cavities can be excavated as long as the previous one has been \nbackfilled.  \nBeginning as  a mining equipment invention initiative in 2004, SABRE was developed by Orano Canada \nInc. in joint -venture partnership with Denison Mines Corp . as a technique for selectively recovering high -\nvalue ore from shallow deposits in the Athabasca Basin. In 2021,  a five -year field -testing program me was \ncompleted at the McClean Lake property in Saskatchewan, Canada.  Four mining cavities were \nsuccessfully excavated to produce approximately 1  500 tonnes of high -value ore ranging in grade from \n4% to 11% U 3O8 (3.4% to 9.3% U). SABRE was able to achieve key test programme operating objectives, \nsuch as targets for cavity diameter, rates of recovery, and mine production rates, with no safety, \nenvironmental, or radiological incidents.  \nDue to its less intrusive nature and po tentially smaller surface footprint , SABRE can  significantly reduce  \nthe environmental  impact  of this mining method, when compared to conventional mining methods . \nReduced water usage and power consumption can also contribute to potential reductions in \ngreenhouse gas emissions . Additionally, as a non -entry mining method, it has significant safety and \nradiological benefits.  \n  \nURANIUM SUPPLY  \n58 URANIUM 2022: RESOURCES, PRODUCTI ON AND DEMAND, NEA No. 7634, © OECD 2023  Despite poor market conditions, Canada’s high grade uranium deposits remain the prime \ntarget for uranium exploration. Recently discovered lar ge high grade uranium deposits include \nPhoenix/Gryphon and Heldeth Túé (Denison Mines Inc.), Triple R (Fission Uranium Corp.), Arrow \n(Next -Gen Energy Corp.) and Fox Lake (Cameco Corp.). While work -related COVID -19 pandemic \nrestrictions have limited activit y at many of these projects, Denison continues technological \ntesting and is conducting an environmental assessment of a proposal to mine the Phoenix \ndeposit by ISR, the first proposed use of this method for unconformity -type uranium deposits. \nDenison’s Hel deth Túé project is also slated to be mined by ISR.  \nIn the United States , the total expenditures for land , exploration , drilling , production and \nreclamation decreased to USD 108.8 million in 2018, down 11% from USD  122.6 million in 2017 and \nnotably lower t han the 2016 total of USD 169.9 million. The trend of decreased expenditures that \nbegan in 2013 continued to the point that since 2018 most information is being withheld by the United States Energy Information Administration to avoid disclosure of individu al company data \ndue to the limited number of companies reporting. Publicly available information , however , even \nif not officially reported , indicates that investment in the exploration sector has continued to \ndecrease significantly during this period. The overall decrease in reported expenditures (except exploration expenditures in 2017) was primarily the result of a depressed uranium market and a global oversupply of uranium during a lengthy period.  \nIn Mexico , after several years of modest expenditures , total exploration and development \nexpenditures increased from USD 0.66 million in 2016 to USD  1.2 million in 2018 , as the \ngovernment invested in the re -evaluation of resource declarations for 53 previously discovered \nuranium deposits , drilling 5  164 m in 47  holes through 2017 and 2018. Results showed that \nprevious work did not meet international standards of evaluation and the main exploration \neffort was to be focused on Santiago Papasquiaro , where anomalies and evidence of surface and \nunderground uranium mi nerals have been defined. No exploration and development \nexpenditures were officially reported by Mexico for 2019, but according to publicly available \ninformation from the Mexican Geological Survey , 2019 expenditures were approximately \nUSD  871 000. Subsequ ently , exploration activities slowed down , no drilling campaigns were \ncarried out , and no exploration and mine development expenditures were reported for 2020 and \n2021.  \nCentral and South America \nUranium exploration and mine development expenditures in the Central and South American \nregion accounted for <2% of reported global expenditures from 2018 to 2021 , with ongoing \nactivities in a number of countries despite sharply reduced expenditures in Brazil , the only \ncountry that had produced uranium in this region in recent years.  \nIn Argentina, the continued investment in uranium exploration aligns with the 2006 \ngovernment policy of reactivating the national nuclear energy programme. Reported domestic exploration expenditures by government i n 2018 amounted to  26.9 million  Argentine pesos (ARS), \nincreasing to ARS  31.8 million in 2019 , then declining to ARS  27.4 million in 2020 , with \nARS 63 million expected in 2021 (expenditures in local currency are considered a more reliable \nguide due to the extreme Argentinea n currency fluctuations in recent years). Expenditures by \nprivate explorati on companies amounted to ARS  39 million , ARS 32.3 million and ARS  48.8 million \nin 2018, 2019 and 2020 respectively , but are expected to increase significantly to ARS  287 million \nin 2021. However , because there is no requirement for private industry to report exploration \nexpenditures , the amounts reported may not reflect all expenditures in the sector.  \nFrom 2017 to 2019, exploration activities carried out by the government slowed dow n and no \ndrilling was carried out. Activities were focused on field work for geological and radiometric reviews , geophysical surveys , sampling for geochemical analysis and environmental studies. \nGovernment exploration activities in Argentina were expected to intensify in the second half of \n2021, including a 1  200 m drilling programme in the Neuquén basin , but this was postponed until \n2022.  \n URANIUM SUPPLY  \nURANIUM 2022: RESOURCES, PRODUCTION AND DEMAND, NEA No. 7634, © OECD 2023  59 Of those uranium deposits managed by the CNEA (the National Atomic Energy Commission), \nthe most relevant in the assessment/exploration stage is Cerro Solo in Chubut Province. Work \nto define the hydrometallurgical extraction line of uranium and molybdenum minerals and \nlaboratory -scale sample testing was completed , but further up -scale testing was postponed. \nSince 2018, only  environmental monitoring has been carried out at the site since hydrological, \npalaeontological, socio -economic , air quality , flora and fauna, pedological and archaeological \nstudies have been completed. Radiometric/radiological and natural acidic drainage surveys are \nbeing developed in compliance with provincial regulations.  \nSophia Energy S.A. , UrAmerica Ltd , Blue Sky Uranium Corp. , U3O8 Corp. and Consolidated \nUranium Inc. reported exploration -related activities during the 2017- 2021 period. Sophia Energy \nS.A. continued exploration of its mining properties at the Laguna Sirven deposit in Santa Cruz \nProvince , including completion of a 600 km2 radiometric airborne survey of the entire project. In \nDecember 2019, Sophia Energy S.A. received approval from the prov incial government to \nperform an intensive two -year advanced exploration programme focused on resource \nassessment , but the COVID -19 pandemic caused exploration activities to be put on hold since \nearly 2021.  \nIn 2019 , Blue Sky Uranium Corp. announced the firs t preliminary economic assessment (PEA) \nfor the Ivana deposit (Amarillo Grande project), as well as an updated inferred in situ resource \nestimate , including 8  730 tU at 0.031%  U and 2 920 tV at 0.011% V. Exploration in 2019 continued \nto focus on expanding the mineralisation proximal to the Ivana deposit. A drilling programme was launched in Q1 2020 , immediately halted due to the COVID -19 pandemic , and then resumed \nin Q1 2021.  \nIn June 2021 , International Consolidated Uranium Inc. announced that it had chosen to \nexercise its option to purchase the Laguna Salada project (Chubut province) from U3O8 Corp. In \nDecember 2021, this acquisition was completed an d, although the Laguna Salada project has \nbeen in care and maintenance since 2014 , it is expected that exploration activities will be \nresumed in the short term.  \nExploration drilling by private companies totalled 2 373  m (236 holes) in 2018, 654 m (88 holes) \nin 2019, 385 m (8 holes) in 2020 , before increasing to 4 115 m (80 holes) in 2021. Exploration \ntrenching was also reported in 2018 (60 m in 39 trenches) and 2021 (100 m in 20 trenches).  \nIn Brazil , no exploration and mine development expenditures wer e reported from 2018 to \n2021. In late 2020 , a reassessment of resources in several deposits in the provinces of Lagoa Real \nand the Santa Quitéria deposit was initiated , with results expected in 2022. E fforts have been \ndevoted to making the transition from open pit to underground mining of the Cachoeira deposit , \ndeveloping open -pit mining of the Engenho deposit and expanding the Lagoa Real production \ncentre.  \nChile did not report exploration and development expenditures for this edition and , given \nthe lack o f updates on projects in northern Chile’s iron -oxide copper -gold belt , with potential \nfor copper , gold , silver and uranium , activity has likely continued at a reduced pace since 2016.  \nIn Ecuador , between 2019 and 2021, the Geological and Energy Research Institute (IIGE) of \nEcuador , assisted by the IAEA through the Undersecretariat of Nuclear Control , Investigations and \nApplication´s liaison , updated and reviewed historical information on uranium exploration in the \ncountry , with the objective of taking up r esearch carried out years ago by the National Polytechnic \nSchool and the Ecuadorian Atomic Energy Commission (CEEA). Despite these surveys and background research, the Mining Regulatory and Control Agency (ARCOM) has not reported any \nprivate or state concessions in its mining portfolio related to uranium exploration in recent years.  \nIn 2020, the Private Technical University of Loja (UTPL) carried out a geochemical survey in \nthe Chirimoyo and Guineo micro- basins in the Puyango area, finding anomalies of V , U and Zn \nrelated to black limestones, bituminous limestones and calcareous shales of marine origin. This \nstudy confirmed the radiometric anomalies previously identified by the National Polytechnic \nSchool and the CEEA in the 1970s and 1980 s. \nURANIUM SUPPLY  \n60 URANIUM 2022: RESOURCES, PRODUCTION AND DEMAND, NEA No. 7634, © OECD 2023Since U3O8 Corp. le ft Guyana  in 2012, there has been no signifi cant exploration , but the \nGuyana Geology and Mines Commission  (GGMC)  conti nues to conduct annual geochemical \nproject s to map the country's mineral potential. In recent years , GGMC data from Permission \nfor Geological and Geographical Survey (PGGS) Areas for both li ght and heavy rare earth \nelements has shown that uranium concentrations are higher than other elements , rang ing from \nmore than 2.7 to 296 ppm (0.0003% U to 0.03% U). GGMC was expecting to continue  carrying out \ngeochemi cal survey projects in Guyana’s interior , beginning in Septe mber 2021.  \nThe government of Paraguay did not respo nd to  the Red Book questi onnai re for this editio n, \nalthough exploration was carried out by Uranium Energy Corporation (UEC) from 2019 to 2021 \nin the Co ronel Oviedo area. Several radon emmanometry surveys and dril ling explo ratio n \ntotall ing appro ximately 1  000 m we re conducted , with total ope ratin g expenditures amounting \nto US D 750 000. UEC has reported an explorati on target at Coronel Oviedo rang ing from 8 900 to \n21 500 tU at grades betwe en 0.034 and 0.044 % U and that the uranium- bearing unit has aquifer \ncharacteristics suitable for ISL. \nFor Peru , no exploration and devel opment expenditures were reported in this editio n, and the \nindustry is not requi red to report expenditures to the government. In 2021, American Lithium Corp . \nacquired Pla teau Energy Metals and its projects in the Macusani district a nd announced drilling \nplans (12  000 m; 70 holes) for the Macusani project to expand existing uranium resources and \nidentify new deposits. The permitting process has  been initiated , including development of an \nenvironmental impact assess ment and community access agreements. Dril ling is expected to \nstart once an exploration permi t is granted.  \nEuropean U nion \nUranium -related expl oration and mine develo pment activities in the European Union \naccounted for <0.5% of total reported global expenditures from 201 8 through 2021 , as the main \nactivities conti nued to be focused on remediation of closed uranium mines. Mine development \nactivities continued in  Denmark (Greenland),  Hungary and Spain, but new legislation \njeopardises pr ojects in Denmark (Greenland),  and in July of 2021, Spain’s  nucl ear regulator \nblocked Berkeley En ergia’s planned uranium mine over s afety concerns.  \nIn the Czech  Republic , exploration and development expenditures dropped from \nUSD  514 000 in 2016 to USD 17 000 in 2017 and USD 9 000 in 2018 , before increasing to \nUSD  197 000 in 2019, USD 284 000 in 20 20 and USD 289 000 in 20 21. After closure of the Rozná \nmine in 2017 , exploration activities have been focused on the conservatio n and processing of \nprevio usly collected explorati on data from Czech uranium deposits. Advanced processing of the \nexpl oratio n data and building of an exploration database will continue in the comi ng years. In \n2019 and 2020, activities included analysis and evaluation o f rock samples, geological \ndocumentation , developing a feasibility study and final reports, as well as archiving da ta. No \ndrilling data has been reported in the Czech Republic since 2016.  \nDenmark (Greenland)  reported total expendi tures of between USD 1.5 mill ion and 3  milli on \nfor all commodities fro m 2016 to 2019 , but the portion spent on uranium is not possible to separate. \nNo expenditure fig ures for 2020 and 2021 were reported , and no drilli ng data was reported for the \nentire five -year period. Since 2007, Greenland Minerals Limited (GML; prior to 2018 , Greenland \nMinerals and Energy Ltd) has conducted ra re earth element (U -Zn) exploration activities in the \nKvanefjeld area, South Green land , including  drilling of 57  710 m of core. A  mining/exploitation \nlicence application was submitted in July 2019 , including updated environmental and social \nimpact assessments together with a navigational s afety investigation study. Howeve r, an April \n2021 election in Greenland led to a change in governmen t that passed a new law prohibiting \nexploration and explo itation of uranium as of December 2021. Pas sage of this new law pro mpted \nGML to request arbi tration proceedings with the governments of Greenland a nd Denmark \nconcerning the impact o f this new legislation on its exploration licence for the Kvanefjel d REE , \nzinc and uranium project under development in southern Greenland.  \nIn Finland , no exploration expenditures o r drilling d ata e xclusively f or uranium h ave been \nreported s ince 2014. Howeve r, uranium m ay be in cluded in som e active g old exploration p ermits. \n URANIUM SUPPLY  \nURANIUM 2022: RESOURCES, PRODUCTION AND DEMAND, NEA No. 7634, © OECD 2023  61 In France , although no domestic uranium exploration and mine development activities have \nbeen carried out since 1999, majority government -owned Orano ( formerly Areva) and its \nsubsidiaries remain active abroad. As of 2020 , Orano S.A. has been working outside France , \nfocusing on discovery of exploitable resources in Canada, Gabon , Kazakhstan, Mongolia , Namibia  \nand Niger . In Canada, Kazakhstan and Niger , Orano is also involved in uranium mining operations. \nIn addition, as a non- operator , Orano holds shares in several mining operations and research \nprojects in different countries. In 2020 , Orano started exploration in Uzbekistan. Total non -\ndomestic exploration expenditures remained relatively steady from 2017 to 2018 at about \nUSD 30 million per year , before declining by 17% to around USD  25 million in 2019 and 2020.  \nThe government of Hungary did not report any exploration or mine development \nexpendi tures for this edition. The non -governmental mine development project , which started in \n2007 with a focus on the Mecsek deposit and surroundings, is still in the environmental licensing \nphase. The Environmental Impact Study submitted at the end of 2017 is expected to be modified \nregarding the planned production rate , following some legal actions and discussions with the \nenvironmental authority. If a licence is obtained , a mining property could be established and likely \nmerged with the existing, historic min ing properties in the area.  \nFor Poland , no exploration and development expenditure data were reported , although  \nthere are some prospective indications of uranium and currently some small prospects \namenable for the discovery of uranium that could potentially be economically exploited.  \nIn Portugal  there has been no exploration or exploitation of uranium since 2001 , although \nthere are unexploited uranium deposits located in the southern part of the country. However , \nno future production centres are planned , and rehabilitation and remediation (environment and \nsafety) are the only activities being undertaken.  \nIn the Slovak Republic , exploration in Kuriskova associated with the Košice uranium deposit , \ninitiated in 2011 by Ludovika Energy Ltd (a subsidiary of Euro pean Uranium Resources) , came to \nan end in 2015 when exploration licences were not renewed by the government. Several protests \nand lawsuits over the allocation of exploration areas followed , as well as political discussions to \nban uranium mining and explor ation in the country, and no new uranium exploration licences \nhave been issued in the Slovak  Republic since.  \nIn Slovenia , expenditures on uranium exploration ended in 1990, and there are no recent or \nongoing uranium exploration activities in the country. I n 1992, the final closure and subsequent \ndecommissioning of the Žirovski Vrh mine and mill complex began with the production facility being dismantled. After finishing the remediation , the remaining disposal sites and the mine \nwater effluents were put under long -term environmental surveillance. A hydrometallurgical \ntailings disposal site and a waste rock disposal site associated with this facility , are undergoing \nenvironmental remediation, with the disposal site for hydrometallurgical tailings in its final stage , \nand with the critical factor being the stability of the site. All remediation work was finished on the \nmine waste pile site , and in 2015 , long -term environmental surveillance began.  \nSpain  reported around USD 1 million in 2017 and 2018 in exploration  and mine development \nexpenditures by industry , declining to USD 893 000 in 2019 and USD  285 000 in 2020, with an \nincrease to USD 417 000 expected in 2021. No industry exploration drilling was reported from 2018 \nto 2020, but 3  350 m (13 holes) of exploration drilling was expected in 2021. This reflects a shift by \nBerkeley Minera España S.L.U. from exploration to licensing of its proposal to mine uranium by \nopen pit in Salamanca province. However , Spain’s Climate Change Law of May 2021 , which aims \nto ensure the nation’s compliance with the objectives of the Paris Agreement and the associated \nenergy transition. It includes a section regarding uranium mining and milling facilities in Spain. No new permits to exploit radioactive mineral deposits will be admitted after the law comes into \nforce . In July 2021 , the Spanish Nuclear Safety Council issued a negative report on the construction \nlicence application for Berkeley’s proposed processing plant.  The report is mandatory , and when \nnegative or regarding the conditions imposed, it is binding for action to be taken by the Ministry \nfor the Ecological Transition and the Demographic Challenge  (MITECO ), who are  in charge of \ngranting construction license s. Consequently, MITECO  rejected Berkeley Energia ’s authorisation \nto build a uranium processing plant at the company ’s Salamanca project in western Spain.  \nURANIUM SUPPLY  \n62 URANIUM 2022: RESOURCES, PRODUCTI ON AND DEMAND, NEA No. 7634, © OECD 2023  On 16  May 2018, the Parliament of Sweden  passed an amendment to the Environmental Code \nbanning uranium exploration and mining in the country. Prior to this , most exploration activity \nwas related to the potential of alum (black) shale , where uranium could be recovered as a by-\nproduct along with other co- products such as molybdenum , vanadium , nickel , zinc and petroleum \nproducts. The Australian company Aura Energy Ltd , having worked for several years developing \nthe Häggån Project for uranium and  vanadium mining , lodged a claim against the Swedish \ngovernment in November 2019 for compensation of financial losses resulting from the 2018 ban \non uranium exploration and mining. Although no input was received from Sweden for this edition \nof the Red Book , it has been reported (Casey , 2022) that Aura Energy is appealing to the Swedish \ngovernment to develop the Häggån Project to address security of supply for energy and battery \nmetals , following Vattenfall’s decision to suspend orders of uranium and nuclear  fuel from Russia  \nuntil further notice owing to the current geopolitical situation (Vattenfall, 2022) . \nIn previous reports, countries such as Poland  and the Slovak Republic  were either interested \nin or issuing permits to explore for and develop domestic ur anium deposits for mining. Neither \nPoland nor the Slovak Republic , or any other country in the European Union, reported uranium \nexploration and mine development expenses for this edition , except for those outlined above. In \nFebruary 2018, it was reported t hat the Supreme Court of the Slovak Republic supported the \nEnvironment Ministry in not extending an exploration licence for uranium held by Ludovika \nEnergy.  \nEurope (non -EU) \nUranium exploration and mine development expenditures in non -EU countries in Europe  \naccounted for 2.5% to 10% of total reported global expenditures in 2018 through 2021, led by \nexploration and mine development activities in Russia  and Ukraine , supplemented by ongoing \nexploration in Türkiye . \nIn Russia , exploration of identified deposits i s carried out by the subsidiary uranium mining \nenterprises of JSC Atomredmetzoloto (ARMZ), which is a part of the Russian State Atomic Energy \nCorporation Rosatom. The main exploration activities in 2019 and 2020 were concentrated on \nthe Dobrovolnoye deposit (Dalur mine). A significant increase in investment from 2019 to 2020 \n(USD 1.8 million to USD 6.7 million) is associated with the development of exploration drilling \nat the Dobrovolnoye deposit , with completion planned for 2023. The Priargunsky production  \ncentre continued limited exploration focused on identifying uranium resources on the flanks of the deposits currently being mined by drilling boreholes from the underground mine workings.  \n \nBox 1.2. Smart ISL Site Digital Mining System  \nThe “Smart ISL Site” digital mining system was developed by the ARMZ Uranium Holding Company and \nthe Seversk Institute of Technology, and implemented at the Dalur and Khiagda ISL operations in the \nKurgan Region and Republic of Buryatia in Russia, respectiv ely. The system includes digital technologies \nfor the management of uranium production based on automatic data collection and remote control of \nwellfield units, comprehensive analysis of all geological and operational data, and geological, \nhydrological an d technical simulations.  \nThe Smart ISL Site  system is operated from a central control complex. It monitors and manages \nhydrodynamic processes to provide uniform leaching of wellfield units, simulates movement of \ngroundwater in each cell and mining block, and takes into account their mutual influence on one other. \nThe system optimises hydrodynamic conditions, automatically adjusts optimum well productivity, and \nidentifies wells in need of repair and restoration.  \nSmart ISL Site improves working conditions, inc reases labo ur productivity, ensures prompt receipt and \nprocessing of operational data, and provides efficient technical solutions for ISL process optimisation. It \nimproves the leaching process by enhancing the rate and reducing the time of uranium extraction, as \nwell as reducing reagent consumption, resulting in significant savings in operational costs.  \n URANIUM SUPPLY  \nURANIUM 2022: RESOURCES, PRODUCTION AND DEMAND, NEA No. 7634, © OECD 2023  63 Domestic exploration and mine development expenditures in Russia increased from \nUSD  8 million to 13  million from 2018 to 2020, with development expenditures  increasing from \n18% in 2020 to 68% of  total expenditures in 2021.  \nFrom 2018 to 2020, Russia, through Uranium One (owned by Rosatom), carried out exploration \nand pilot test work for uranium at joint ventures in Kazakhstan, work in Tanzania to prepare for \nthe development of the Mkuju River uranium project, and exploration in Namibia.  \nIn Kazakhstan, six uranium mines jointly owned by Uranium One are in commercial operation. \nIn 2020, exploration in the expanded geological allotment of the Zarechnoye deposit w as \ncompleted and additional resources were identified to extend the life of the mine. In 2021, a new exploration programme was launched at the Kharasan mine to convert defined resources into more reliable categories.  \n \nBox 1.3. Innovations at Kazatomprom J SC Uranium Mining Operations  \nThe national atomic company Kazatomprom continues its research aimed at the associated extraction \nof rare and rare earth metals from productive solutions of uranium obtained by in  situ recovery (ISR) \nextraction method.  \nScandium : Research work has been carried out to explore the possibility of obtaining scandium -\ncontaining concentrates from mother liquors of uranium sorption and to optimise the process. The \npossibility of obtaining non -radioactive scandium oxide has been confirmed. Work is underway on the \napplication of nanofiltration technology to concentrate the productive solution and increase the \nefficiency of obtaining scandium oxide from the mother liquors of uranium ISL operations.  \nRhenium : During the processing of the prod uctive solution of ISL, rhenium along with uranium is extracted \nand concentrated into an ion- exchange resin, which can serve as a source for obtaining rhenium. The \ntechnique has been developed and tested on an enlarged laboratory -scale technology for the p roduction \nof ammonium perrhenate. The results showed that it is feasible to extract rhenium. Kazatomprom is \nworking on the manufacture of a mobile plant to produce a crude rhenium concentrate.  \nVanadium : A project is being implemented to assess the possibility of obtaining vanadium from sorption \nmother liquors during uranium mining at the Zarechnoye deposit.  \nIn Tanzania, Mantra Resources (purchased by ARMZ in 2011) completed a major exploration \nprogramme at the Mkuju River deposit in 2016. During 2017- 2019, further development was \nsuspended due to unfavourable market conditions. In 2020 , a decision was made to build a pilot \nprocessing plant during 2021- 2022 and to proceed with pilot open -pit mining from 2023 to 2025.  \nIn Namibia , Uranium One , through its subsidiary Headspring Investments Pty. , conducted \nan intensive drilling exploration programme in 2019 and 2020. As a result , a new sandstone -\ntype uranium deposit (Wings) was discovered with JORC compliant resources amounting to RAR \nof 14 700 tU and IR of 9 900 tU , with an exploration potential of 40 000 tU. Based on 2020 results , \nresources are potentially amenable for development by ISL, and a pre -feasibility study \ncompleted in 2021 confirmed positive economics for exploitation by ISL. The 2021 exploration \nprogramme includes further drilling aimed at identifying additional resources and preparing for an ISL pilot test.  \nIn Türkiye , government exploration expenditures increased from USD  223 000 in 2016 to \nUSD 3.0 million in 2018 , rising to USD 14.2 million in 2019 before falling to USD  7.3 million in 2020 , \nwith expenditure figures not available for 2021. Exploration drilling amounted to just over \n198 600 m (484 holes) in 2019 and 193 300 m (576 holes) in 2020, the only two years reported. No \ndevelopment expendi tures were reported. Efforts were mainly focused on exploration of granite , \nacidic igneous and sedimentary rocks in Edirne , Kırklareli and Tekirda ğ provinces. In 2020, \nURANIUM SUPPLY  \n64 URANIUM 2022: RESOURCES, PRODUCTI ON AND DEMAND, NEA No. 7634, © OECD 2023  Çanakkale , Nevşehir, Yozgat , Giresun , Manisa and Ayd ın provinces were explored for radioactive \nraw materials and drilling was conducted in Nev şehir, Çanakkale , Giresun and Ayd ın provinces. \nIn 2021, a drilling programme to confirm previous work and develop resource estimates at the \nManisa- Köprüba şı exploration site was undertaken.  \nIn early 2019, Westwater Resources Inc. reported that the Turkish government had cancelled \nall exploration and operating licences held by Adur in June 2018 (Adur was Westwater’s Turkish \nsubsidiary , Adur Madencilik Limited Sirketi). Adur and its predecessors had bee n developing the \nTemrezli and Ş efaatli projects, carrying out drilling , testing and studies to move the projects \ntowards production. The issue remains the subject of an arbitration tribunal as Westwater seeks \ncompensation for its investments, with a formal  ruling on the case expected in the second half of \n2022 (Westwater Resources , 2022).  \nIn Ukraine , exploration and development expenditures totalled USD  800 000 in 2018, \nUSD  2.2 million in 2019 , USD  1.7 million in 2020 and USD  3.3 million  in 2021. Developmen t \nexpenditures accounted for 90% , 96% and 92% of total expenditures respectively over the \n2019 -2021 period (with most of the investments in each year made by industry) , as mine \ndevelopment was accelerated to meet the government target of fulfilling all dom estic uranium \nrequirements with local production by 2030.  During the 2019 to 2021 reporting period , a total of \nover 32 974 m of drilling (1 873 holes) was conducted , all by the government , with the majority \n(>87% each year) for development. SE Kirovgeology  focused on analytical work of existing \ngeological data to identify areas perspective for uranium exploration.  \nAfrica  \nUranium exploration and mine development expenditures in Africa accounted for about 2% of total reported global expenditures in 2018 and 2 019, rising to 6% in 2020 and 7% in 2021. Although \nCOVID -19 restrictions reduced or delayed activities in several countries, work on the development \nof new mines continued in Botswana , Mali, Mauritania, Namibia , Niger , Tanzania  and Zambia , \nalong with associated exploration activities in these countries and Egypt . \nIn Algeria , the Agence du Service Géologique de l'Algérie, in collaboration with the United \nStates Geological Survey , conducted preliminary prospecting (reconnaissance -level) for \nundiscovered mineral resources (diamond , Au, PGE-Cr, Cu-Ni-PGE-Cr, Mo-Cu and uranium) \nrelated to granites , calcretes , and alkaline rocks in the Eglab Region of the Reguibat \nPaleoproterozoic shield in southwestern Algeria during 2017 and 2018. For granite -hosted (shear \nzone) , calcrete -hosted and alkaline rock -hosted deposit types , it was determined that the \npotential for economic uranium mineralisation was low , with no significant resources identified. \nNo uranium prospecting or mine development work was carrie d out between January 2019 and \nJanuary 2021 , largely due to the COVID -19 pandemic.  \nAlgeria moved to regulate activities related to the research , production and peaceful use of \nnuclear energy with the adoption of Law No. 19 -05 on 17 July 2019, leading to th e creation of the \nNational Authority for Nuclear Safety and Security under the supervision of the Prime Minister \nby executive decree (No 21 -148 of 20 April 2021). This independent administrative authority , \nwhich has legal authority and financial autonomy , is the competent authority charged with \ndrafting legislation and regulations relating to nuclear activities and guides of good practice to ensure the safety and security of operations , and to ensure their application. Its prerogatives \nalso include the issu ance of authorisations and licences , control of installations , approval of \ntraining programmes , approval and management of emergency plans , and co -operation with \ninternational and regional organisations. Pending the establishment of the independent \nauthori ty, the Atomic Energy Commission (COMENA) continues to exercise its prerogatives.  \nIn Botswana , no exploration and mine development expenditures were reported. However , \nAustralian based A -Cap Resources (now A -Cap Energy Limited) , after conducting research to \noptimise mining and attending to the requirements of the Letlhakane Uranium Project’s mining licence , shifted its efforts to requesting extensions on the commencement of the pre-\nconstruction and construction period specified in the Letlhakane mining lic ence due to low \nuranium market prices and COVID -19 pandemic work restrictions in 2019. In September 2021, \n URANIUM SUPPLY  \nURANIUM 2022: RESOURCES, PRODUCTION AND DEMAND, NEA No. 7634, © OECD 2023  65 the government amended the licence at A -Cap’s request to specify that the construction period \nwill start by 30  September  2024.  \nIn the Central African Republic , following the attack at the Bakouma project site in 2012 that \nled to the suspension of all activities, field uranium exploration and mine development work has \nnot been undertaken. However , in its 2020 Annual Report , Orano outlined the results of a new \nresource evaluation that shows IR in situ resources amounting to 36  475 tU at an average grade of \n0.20 %U in the <USD 260 cost category. This is a downgrade of resources reported in previous \neditions of the Red Book , where Bakouma resources were repo rted as 42 200 tU RAR in situ in the \n<USD 260 cost category. While the Bakouma uranium deposit is associated with phosphates, which are typically reported as unconventional resources , it is classified as a conventional deposit \nbecause of the relatively hig h (0.15- 0.30% U) uranium grade.  \nThe last time the Democratic Republic of Congo  (DRC) reported exploration activities to the \nRed Book was in 1988 (at that time the DRC was known as Zaire). Recently , the IAEA has been \nproviding support for the identification  and evaluation of uranium and other radioactive \nresources in the Katanga province in the DRC through the Technical Co -operation programme \nentitled , “Strengthening National Capacities for the Assessment of Uranium Resources and \nOther Radioactive Minerals and for the Regulation of Associated Mining Activities”. This programme began in 2018 and continued through 2020.  \nEgypt  reported government exploration and mine development expenditures of USD  84 000 in \n2018 and USD 90 000 in 2019, before increasing significantly to USD  186 000 and USD  254 000 in \n2020 and 2021 respectively , as the Egyptian Nuclear Materials Authority (NMA) focused efforts on \nthe exploration of four prospects in the Eastern Desert and South Sinai. These activities involved exploratory trenchi ng and shallow drilling programmes and were supported by geophysical and \ngeochemical surveys following subsurface extensions of the formations hosting uranium \nmineralisation. They resulted in significantly increased prognosticated resource estimates. Mine \ndevelopment expenditures comprised 33% of total expenditures from 2018 to 2021 as pilot production facilities planned for 2025 at Abu Rusheid (where uranium occurrences are associated \nwith REEs) and El Sella as well as established facilities at Gattar and Abu Zenima continue to \ninvestigate uranium recovery through heap and vat leaching , and beginning in 2019 , by ion \nexchange. Exploratory trenching amounted to 1  310 m (46 trenches) and drilling totalled 9  450 m \n(394 holes) between 2018 and 2021.  \nEgypt has had ongoing support for over two decades in developing uranium exploration and \nproduction capacities through several IAEA Technical Co -operation projects. The most recent \ninclude “Enhancing Regional Capabilities for a Sustainable Uranium Mining Industry ” and  \n“Supporting a Feasibility Study for Uranium and Rare -Earth Element Recover y from \nUnconventional Resources” , both of which began in 2018; “ Supporting Uranium , Thorium and \nRare Metal Evaluation , Production and Purificat ion from Conventional Resources” and \n“Supporting Uranium Recovery from Solid Radioactive Waste Produced in the R adioisotope \nProduction Facility” , both of which began in 2020; and “ Enhancing Regional Capabilities for \nSustainable Uraniu m Exploration and Mining (AFRA)” and “ Supporting Feasibility  Study for \nUranium , Thorium and Rare Metals Recov ery from Conventional Resources” , both of which \nbegan in 2022.  \nFor Malawi , no exploration and mine development expenses were reported , as activities \nground to a halt  when the government imposed a moratorium in 2015 on applications and grants \nfor all mining and exploration tenements until a new cadastral system and a new minerals act is \nintroduced. On 14  December  2018, the National Parliament of Malawi passed new legislation \n(Mines and Minerals Bill 2018) to update and replace the current , outdated legislation. The Mines \nand Minerals Bill was assented to by State President Arthur Peter Mutharika on 25  January and \ngazetted on 15 February 2019. As of June 2020, the mines and minerals regulations for the new \nlegislation had been finalised and were awaiting gazetting.  \nWhile no exploration activities since 2015 were reported , an ownership change occurred to \nthe country’s only uranium mine (Kayelekera, now idled). On 13  March  2020, Paladin completed \nthe sale of its 85% interest in Paladin (Africa) Ltd to Lotus Resources (65%) and Lily Resources Pty Ltd (20%). Lotus , formerly Hylea Metals Ltd , holds 76.5% of the shares in Lily with Kayelekera \nURANIUM SUPPLY  \n66 URANIUM 2022: RESOURCES, PRODUCTI ON AND DEMAND, NEA No. 7634, © OECD 2023  Resources Pty Ltd holding 23.5% , giving Kayelekera Resources Pty Ltd an indirect 20% interest in \nthe Kayelekera project. The remaining 15% of shares in Paladin (Africa) Ltd are held by the Malawi \ngovernment. Paladin is to receive a 3.5% royalty based on revenues derived from future producti on \nat Kayelekera, capped at AUD  5 million.  \nIn Mali , reported private sector exploration and mine development expenditures of \nUSD  390 000 in 2017 and USD 354 000 in 2018 , before declining to USD  298 000 in 2019 and \nUSD  30 000 in 2020 as a rebellion in the n orth-eastern part of the country limited activities to \nthe western regions of the country. As of 20  December  2021, four uranium exploration permits \nhad been granted to two exploration companies in Mali . In 2019, ASTER images of the Falea area \nwere interpre ted for the identification of new exploration targets and in May and June 2020 , soil \nand termitaria sampling were completed. The geochemical results highlighted significant gold \nanomalies , in addition to already known U , Cu and Ag anomalies in the Falea pr oject area. During \nthe fourth quarter of 2020, GoviEx conducted a core sampling and geophysics programme , which \nidentified a significant correlation between the Birimian geology , the fault structures and the \ngeophysical chargeability anomalies in relation to gold mineralisation. No uranium exploration \ndrilling was completed in 2020. In January 2021, GoviEx announced a 6  000 m air core drilling \nprogramme to test the gold potential associated with soil anomalies.  \nIn Mauritania, no exploration and development  expenditures were reported , although \nprivate sector activity to advance mine development continues , notably by Australia’s Aura \nEnergy at the Tiris (Reguibat) project. On 29  July 2019, Aura released the results of the Definitive \nFeasibility Study , which c onfirmed that the Tiris Uranium Project is both a low cost and a low \noperating cost development. The project is designed to support an open -pit mine , a 1.25 million \ntonne ore processing plant and supporting infrastructure. The uranium mineralisation lies \nlargely within 3 to 5 m of the surface in a relatively soft , free digging material containing patchy \ncalcrete. Based on trenching and metallurgical test work to date , the mineralisation does not \nrequire blasting before mining or crushing prior to beneficia tion.  \nIn 2021, Aura released the results of new resource estimates of the Tiris East deposits, resulting \nin a 2 080 tU increase in resources and a new JORC compliant resource estimate including the Sadi \nSouth Zone. Based on an 85  ppm U cut -off (0.0085% U) , global in situ Tiris project resources total \n7 499 tU in the measured and indicated categories , and 14 308 tU in the inferred category. In July \n2021, Aura commenced Stage 2 exploration , with key results of this work expected to include \ndetailed results of several approaches being considered to lower operating costs, completion of a \nnet zero emission study , water drilling results building on 2019 findings and the potential positive \nimpact on the Tiris project operating cost from vanadium by -product recover y. The Tiris project \nis 85% owned by Tiris Resources SA , a subsidiary of Aura Energy Ltd , and 15% by the Mauritanian \ngovernment through its agency Société Mauritanienne des Hydrocarbures et de Patrimoine Minier \n(SMH -PM). \nSupport in the uranium production c ycle has been provided through an IAEA Technical \nCo-operation project , “Establishing an Effective Monitoring Mechanism for Environmental \nProtection related to Uranium and Mining Activities”. The project began in 2014 and continued through 2017. The specifi c objective of the project was to put in place a framework for \nenvironmental management and build capacity for environmental and radiological site characterisation , leading to baseline generation of potential uranium mining sites in Mauritania \nand building  capacity for monitoring of radionuclides in the environment.   \nIn addition , the United States Geological Survey , in co -operation with the Ministry of \nPetroleum , Energy , and Mines of the Islamic Republic of Mauritania , conducted a preliminary \nmineral resour ce assessment for 12 commodities (including uranium) , and in 2015 published \nthe assessment as Open -File Report 2013-1280, “Second projet de renforcement institutionnel \ndu secteur minier de la République Islamique de Mauritanie (PRISM -II) phase V”. With res pect \nto uranium resources , the assessment report indicated that Mauritania has 80 known uranium \nmineral occurrences and , at the time , was a focus of active exploration for uranium by a number \nof private companies. Seventeen occurrences have had resource es timates published and can \nbe considered as mineral deposits. Fourteen of these are calcrete- type deposits with total \nresources of 138.3 million tonnes at an average grade of 331 ppm U\n3O8. The three bedrock -hosted \ndeposits are granite -hosted vein/shear zone  type deposits with total resources of 46.5 million \n URANIUM SUPPLY  \nURANIUM 2022: RESOURCES, PRODUCTION AND DEMAND, NEA No. 7634, © OECD 2023  67 tonnes at a grade of 248 ppm U 3O8 (0.02%  U). Further, permissive tracts for undiscovered \nuranium deposit types were also delineated.  \nIn Namibia , over 60 exploration licences had been issued  until early 2007 , when a \nmoratorium on new licences was imposed by the Namibian government pending development \nof new policies and legislation , primarily in response to concerns about water and energy \nrequirements of uranium mining. In January 2017 , the N amibian government lifted the 10 -year \nmoratorium on new applications for exploration licences for nuclear fuel minerals and as of the \nend of 2019, 52 new licences had been granted.  \n \nBox 1.4. U -pgradeTM ore beneficiation process  \nNamibian calcrete ores are conglomerates of predominantly quartz, feldspars, biotite and carbonate \ncemented together by a clay matrix. The uranium mineral carnotite occurs predominantly as liberated \nparticles within the clay matrix, sometimes in fractures or on the surface of larger particles. The presence \nof significant quantities of carbonate minerals excludes acid leaching as a process route.  \nThe calcrete deposits are generally <20 m deep with the top 3 to 4 m, representing about 15% of the \ndeposit, containing high sulphate (gypsu m) levels. The sulphate consumes the alkali leach reagent, thus \n15% of the deposit cannot be leached economically with acid or alkali.  \nU-pgradeTM is a beneficiation process that uses commonly known and well understood unit operations \nconfigured in an unconventional manner for uranium. The process was developed in -house by Elevate \nUranium Ltd and has granted patents in various countries.  \nU-pgradeTM exploits the properties of the gangue minerals to reject them through the process, \nproducing a concentrate of < 5% of the mined mass. For example, at Elevate Uranium Ltd’s Marenica \nUranium Project in Namibia, the process increases ore grade from 93 to 5  000 ppm U 3O8. Due to the \nrejection of acid consuming carbonate minerals, the low mass, high grade concentrate can be acid \nleached at a lower temperature and lower cost than the high temperature alkali leach.  \nU-pgradeTM provides a way to process the high sulphate calcrete ore that otherwise cannot be treated \nby conventional processes. This effectively increases the res ource by 15%.  \nThe U-pgradeTM process reduces the capital and operating costs by ~50% compared to conventional \nprocesses. The production of a low mass high grade concentrate provides processing options for the \nconcentrate, which can either be leached and re fined on site or transported off site to be leached and \nrefined by a third party. The latter option reduces the capital expenditure on site without the need for a \nleach and refinery. As such, U -pgradeTM provides a practical means by which lower grade or small \ndeposits can be developed.  \nAmong the environmental benefits of U -pgradeTM: \n• The reduced mass to be leached reduces the volume of acid transported to the mining operation.  \n• The carbonate concentrate produced during the process can be added  to the leach tail to neutralise \nthe acid and precipitate any metals, producing inert tailings.  \nThe tailings dam is <5% of the size of conventional processing  \n  \nURANIUM SUPPLY  \n68 URANIUM 2022: RESOURCES, PRODUCTI ON AND DEMAND, NEA No. 7634, © OECD 2023  Exploration activities between 2018 and 2021 focused on developing properties and little \nwork was undertaken at the existing mine sites. Bannerman Resources continued work on its \nEtango Project, where two -thirds of the identified resources (82 400 tU in situ) are located within \n200 m of the surface. Reptile Mineral Resources continued exploration o f its Omahola Project, \nincluding the Ongolo and MS7 alaskite as well as the Inca skarn deposits, and the Tumas, Tubas \nand Aussinanis surficial calcrete deposits, with total identified in situ resources amounting to \n75 353 tU. Between 2019 and 2021, the foc us was to advance the Tumas Project by conducting a \nscoping study that directly led into a pre -feasibility study completed in February 2021 that \nconfirmed the technical and economic viability of the project. A definitive feasibility study followed that is expected to be completed in 2022. Elevate Uranium Ltd (formerly Marenica Energy) resumed work on the Marencia Project after suspending drilling activities in 2016 due \nto depressed market conditions. In 2020, Elevate announced a new uranium discovery at EPL  \n7278 (“Hirabeb”), then conducted an airborne EM survey of the Hirabeb tenement and the \nassociated paleochannel system in April 2021. In south -eastern Namibia, Russian owned \nUranium One, through its Namibian daughter company Headspring Investments Pty., \ndiscovered and has been developing a new sandstone- type uranium deposit (Wings) that is \npotentially amenable for extraction by ISL. Wings contains JORC compliant in situ resources \namounting to 14 700 tU RAR, 9 900 tU IR, with an exploration potential of 40  000 tU. \nUranium exploration and mine development expenditures in Namibia amounted to \nUSD  3.3 million and USD 3.7 million in 2017 and 2018, respectively, before increasing to \nUSD  6 million in 2019, USD 11.1 million in 2020 and USD 19.2 million in 2021. A tot al of 218 223 m \n(3 939 holes) were drilled in Namibia from 2018 to 2021, with 79% of the drilling for uranium \nexploration.  \nUranium exploration and development expenditures were not reported for all operations in \nNiger  in this edition. Reported expenditures  for GoviEx in 2018 and 2019 and Global Atomic \nCorporation (GAC) in 2020 amounted to USD  6.9 million in 2018 , USD  2.9 million in 2019 and \nUSD  2.5 million in 2020 (expenditures in 2021 were not reported). In 2017 -2018 GAC commenced \na new drilling programme targeting various areas of the Dasa project and a total of 59 holes \namounting to 26  479 m were completed , leading to resource estimates of 39 080 tU indicated \nand 33 695 tU inferred. In 2020, GAC completed a preliminary economic assessment , then \nsubmitted an environmental impact statement and applied for a mining permit. In December \n2020, a Presidential Decree granting the mining permit was approved by the Council of Ministers. \nGAC also received  three -year permit extensions  for each of its six exploration p roperties in \nNiger.   \nGoviEx developed a NI 43 -101 integrated development plan for five deposits (Marianne, \nMarilyn , Miriam , MSNE and Maryvonne) comprising the Madaouela project , with total in situ \nuranium resources amounting to 42 603 tU measured and indic ated and 10  647 tU inferred. In \nSeptember 2019, the Republic of Niger approved the revision to the Madaouela mining permit \nto include 1  550 tU in the measured and indicated categories associated with the Miriam deposit \nas well as 6  880 tU in the measured a nd indicated categories associated with Madaouela South \nNorth East (“MSNE”) deposit. Both were previously situated within the Agaliouk exploration \npermit. In 2020 , GoviEx completed an updated feasibility study and announced the results in \nFebruary 2021. Op en-pit mining is planned with standard truck and shovel operations for the \nMiriam deposit at a planned rate of 1 Mt per year of ore feed to the process plant , with the \nMarianne -Marilyn and MNSE -Maryvonne deposits to be mined by room and pillar. The project 's \nlife is forecast to last 20 years , producing an estimated total of 19  100 tU , averaging 950 tU per \nannum.  \nIn 2019- 2020, Orano continued exploration and development activities within the Cominak \nand Somaïr mines perimeters and in the Arlit concession. S omaïr drilled 16  240 m in 2017, 8 150 m \nin 2018, and was planning 11  863 m in 2019. In October 2018, Somaïr was granted the Artois deposit \nconcession. The government of Niger renewed Pan African Minerals exploration licences \n(Ouricha  1 and 2 , Tegmert 1 and  2) in 2018, but no activity was reported in 2019 and 2020.  \n  \n URANIUM SUPPLY  \nURANIUM 2022: RESOURCES, PRODUCTION AND DEMAND, NEA No. 7634, © OECD 2023  69 In Senegal , although there has been no exploration and mining development for uranium \nsince 2016, undiscovered conventional resources of 1 500 tU have been reported in the Red Book. \nHowever , considering the amount of drilling and analyses completed in the Saraya area and the \nresource estimation completed by COGEMA , the previously reported undiscovered resources have \nbeen reclassified as inferred resources.  \nFor South Africa , no exploration and mine development expenditures were reported  in this \nedition. Low uranium market prices have not only slowed exploration activity but have shelved \nprojects , including  Harmony Uranium TPM (Tshepong , Phakisa and Masimong) and the Free State \nTailings Uranium P roject , which had both been advanced to the feasibility stage , as well as the \nHenkries Project in the Namaqualand , Northern Cape Province , and the Ryst Kuil and \nQuaggasfontein areas (Karoo projects). I n 2018, Mintails Mining South Africa (Pty) Ltd and seve ral \nrelated companies announced their liquidation. Mintails used to mine and process gold and \nuranium from waste piles and open pits in Krugersdorp near Johannesburg.  \nFor Tanzania, exploration and development expenditures were not reported  in this edition. \nThe main focus of activity had been directed at the Nyota deposit (Mkuju River Project), where ISL \ntests  were conducted over  10 months in 2016 using a two-well pattern  and a final report was \nissued in 2017 . The results confirmed the amena bility of the portion  of the resources situa ted \nbelow the water table  for extraction by ISL. During 2017, rehabilitation of aquifers and the ground \nsurface was completed following the ISL tests.  In December 2016, Mantra Resources (purchased \nby ARMZ of Russ ia in 2011) applied to the Ministry of Energy and Minerals of Tanzania for \nsuspension of its special mining licence due to unfavourable uranium market conditions. In \nSeptember 2017, the ministry approved the request. In 2020, Mantra Resources shifted its f ocus \nfrom ISL to open -pit mining and decided to move ahead with a pil ot processing plant during \n2021- 2022 to proceed with a small -scale pilot open -pit mining operation during 2023 -2025. An \nannual pilot plant capacity of 15  000 tonnes of ore assumes product ion of 5 tU/yr. In 2021 , \nMantra/Uranium One applied to the Tanzanian government for permits for uranium exploration \nas well as the siting and construction of a uranium mine processing facility . \nUganda does not report data to the Red Book but may in future since the IAEA has continued \nto support Uganda’s efforts to identify and evaluate uranium res ources through the Technical \nCo-operation programmes “Strengthening the National Capacity for Uranium Exploration and \nEvaluation” from 2014 to 2017, and “Enhancing  Regional Capabilities for a Sustainable Uranium \nMining Industry” from 2018 to 2021. The government continues to evaluate national uranium \nresources utilising their Geological Survey and Mines Department as part of long -term planning \nas the country conside rs adding nuclear energy to its future energy mix.  \nIn Zambia , after acquiring the Mutanga and Chirundu projects in 2016 and 2017 , respectively , \nGoviEx Uranium Inc. (GoviEx) released a new preliminary economic assessment for the Mutanga uranium project , including mineral resource estimates for Mutanga , Dibwe , Dibwe East , Gwabe , \nNjame and Njame South sandstone -hosted ore deposits in 2017. The project currently consists of \nfive main uranium deposits under three fully permitted contiguous mining licences, total ling \n140 km in strike length. It also includes two more prospective licences covering 100  km². Due to \nthe COVID -19 pandemic , GoviEx employees worked remotely in 2020. In 2021, GoviEx planned soil \nsampling and geological mapping in the Mutanga area, as well as an 8  000 m down -hole \npercussion drilling programme (100  m x 50  m grid) , focused on the Dibwe East deposit and new \nareas defined by previous trench sampling east of Dibwe East.  Although total e xploration and \nmine development expenditures were not report ed for this edition , exploration expenditures by \nGoviEx amounted to USD  710 000 in 2017, USD 607 000 in 2018, USD 502  000 in 2019 and \nUSD 536 000 in 2020.  \nMiddle East , Central and Southern Asia \nUranium exploration and mine development expenditures in the Middle East , Central and \nSouthern Asia region amounted to about 20% to 30% of total reported global expenditures , \nmainly in India , Kazakhstan  and Jordan , supplemented for the first time by reported uranium \nexploration activities in Bangladesh and the  Kingd om of Saudi Arabia . \nURANIUM SUPPLY  \n70 URANIUM 2022: RESOURCES, PRODUCTI ON AND DEMAND, NEA No. 7634, © OECD 2023  Bangladesh  provided information for this edition of the Red Book , for the first time since \n1988, as it launches its civil nuclear power programme. During 2018 -2020, the Bangladesh \nAtomic Energy Commission (BAEC), through the Institute o f Nuclear Minerals , Atomic Energy \nResearch Establishment , completed a preliminary programme of uranium and thorium \nexploration over a 12 km2 area in the Jaintiapur and adjacent Sylhet areas of north -east \nBangladesh , spending a total of USD 21 000 from 2019 to 2021.  \nIn India , government exploration and development expenditures remained relatively \nsteady at above USD 60 million from 2017 to 2019, up from USD 40 million to USD  50 million \nsince 2012. They then declined to USD 48 million in 2020, but we re expect ed to rise to over \nUSD  65 million in 2021. In 2020, India ranked second to Canada in uranium exploration and \nmine development expenditures.  \nAs in recent years , exploration activities remain concentrated on various Precambrian and \nPalaeozoic through Cenozoic basins , shear zones , fold belts and metamorphic complexes. \nExtensive exploration , including ground and heliborne geophysical , ground geological, \nradiometric and geochemical surveys , and drilling are planned  in other geological domains of \nthe country that have the potential to host uranium. These efforts have resulted in a 13% \nincrease in RAR and a 7% increase in speculative resources from 2019 to 2021, due to appreciable \nresource additions in the contiguous area of the stratabound deposits in the southern part of \nthe Cuddapah Basin and the extension areas of known deposits in the Singhbhum Shear Zone , \nBhima Basin and North Delhi Fold Belt.  \nIran did not respond to the Red Book 2022 questionnaire , so nothing is available beyond \nreported government exploration and development figures , with expenditures of USD  17.3 million \nin 2016, USD 39.2 million in 2017 , USD 13.6 million in 2018 and USD  9.3 million (expected) in 2019. \nExploration accounted for 53% of total expe nditures over this same period. Exploration drilling \nand trenching totalled 19  918 m (114 holes) and 8 043 m (244 trenches) , respectively , whereas \ndevelopment drilling totalled 17  608 m (3 319 holes).  \nExploration activities in Iran have followed a general  plan in favourable areas from \nreconnaissance to more detailed phases. Reconnaissance and prospecting phases are being \nundertaken over much of the country and uranium mineralisation with positive indications has been found in a variety of geological enviro nments. Targets include granite -related , metasomatic , \nvolcanogenic , intrusive and sedimentary types of deposits.  \nIn Jordan , government exploration expenditures decreased from USD 4.8 million in 2018 to \nUSD 3.5 million in 2019 and USD 2.4 million in 2020 b ut were expec ted to increase slightly to \n2.8 million in 2021. Over that same period , the Jordan Uranium Mining Company (JUMCO) \ncompleted 6  944 m of trenching (1 736 trenches) , all in 2018. Plans for 2019 -2020 included a drilling \nprogramme on a 50 x 50 m gr id in selected areas to upgrade r esources in preparation for \npre-feasibility studies. During the second half of 2019 , JUMCO completed the development of the \nwireline logging capacity required to execute the planned drilling campaign , but during the first \nquarter of 2020 COVID -19 pandemic work restrictions stopped all exploration activities, and the \nplan was put on hold.  \nUranium production cycle activities in Jordan have been supported by several IAEA Technical \nCo-operation projects over the last few years, most recently the “Enhancing Capabilities in \nExtracting Uranium from Local Ores on a Pilot Scale Level” project in 2018 and 2019; “Supporting Capacity Building in Member States for Uranium Production and Safety of Naturally Occurring \nRadioactive Material R esidue Management” and “Developing a Detailed Engineering and Complete \nFeasibility Study for Uranium Extraction from Local Ores” projects started in 2020; and the \n“Enhancing the National Capabilities in Exploiting Uranium Ores in a Safe and Environment \nFriendly Manner” project started in 2022.  \nIn Kazakhstan, exploration and development expenditures decreased from USD  37.3 million \nin 2018 to USD  18.8 million in 2019 and USD 13.4 million in 2020 and were expected to decline to \nUSD 9.9 million in 2021. These expenditures are the lowest since Kazakhstan started ramping up \nits exploration and development activities in 2007 and 2008. During the most recent reporting period (2018- 2021) , 12% of the total expenditures were devoted to mine development activities , \n URANIUM SUPPLY  \nURANIUM 2022: RESOURCES, PRODUCTION AND DEMAND, NEA No. 7634, © OECD 2023  71 the remainder to exploration. Drilling over this same period  amounted to 3  025 707 m (6 208 holes), \nwith development drilling accounting for 1  312 844 m (2 889 holes).  \nDuring 2019  and 2020, exploration was undertaken at Inkai , Budenovskoye in the Shu -Sarysu \nUranium Province and at the Northern Kharasan and Zarechnoye deposits in the Syrdaria \nUranium Province. This resulted in an increase of in situ IR resources of 55 409 tU at sites No. 6 \nand No. 7 of the Budennovskoye field. Total identified resources decrea sed by 111 725 tU, however , \ndue to mining depletion and transfer of the Kosachinoye field resources (OP and UG; 121 630 tU) to the sub -economic category. Kazatomprom also contracted JSC “Volkovgeology” in 2020 to \ncomplete a state geological study focused on the potential for discovery of new “sandstone” type deposits suitable for ISL in perspective areas of the Shu -Sarysu uranium province.  \nRe-evaluations of prognosticated and speculative resources were also undertaken in 2019 and \n2020, resulting in the addi tion of 4 900 tU in high -cost progn osticated resources and over 33  000 tU \nin speculative resources. Of the 114 696 tU prognosticated resource total , 113 166 tU are related to \nsandstone -type deposits and 1 530 tU to the metasomatite type. Of the 219 380 tU total speculative \nresources , 85% relate to the sandstone -type and 15% relate to the unconformity or metasomatite \ntype mineralisation.  \nThe Kingdom of Saudi Arabia  provided information for this edition of the Red Book , the first \ntime that it has done so. The  mining and metals processing sector has grown significantly over \nthe last few years and , in line with Saudi Arabia’s Vision 2030 goal to have a mining sector that \ncontributes to the national economy , a strategic exploration programme for mineral resources, \nincluding uranium , was initiated. From March 2017 to March 2019, the first phase of uranium and \nthorium exploration was conducted , including the evaluation of nine designated areas (including \n36 subareas) covering a total area of 27 000 km\n2 across Saudi Arabia. Exploration targets included \nintrusive , volcanic , phosphate , calcrete and sandstone -hosted deposit types. The Ghurayyah , Jabal \nSayid and Thaniyat Turayf subareas were selected for detailed exploration and the estimation of inferred resources. The c ost of the e xploration programme was USD  37 million between 2017 and \n2020, with USD 849  000 in expected expenses in 2021.  \nAlthough no conventional resources were reported from these efforts , inferred \nunconventional resources were reported , including uranium resources associated with Nb , Zr, \nREE, Ta + Th , in peralkaline granite and pegmatite in the Ghurayyah and Jabal Sayid areas , and \nuranium associated with phosphate horizons. Total in situ unconventional uranium resources \ntotalled 77  731 tU , includin g 63 171 tU associated with the intrusive plutonic deposit type and \n14 560 tU associated with the phosphorite type.  \nThe Saudi Nuclear Regulatory and Radiation Commission (NRRC), a legal public organisation \nwith financial and administrative autonomy, aims t o regulate activities, practices , and facilities \ninvolving the peaceful use of nuclear energy and ionising radiation as Saudi Arabia prepares to \nbring nuclear power into its energy mix by the mid -2030s , introducing demand for uranium to fuel \nthe reactors.  \nUranium production cycle activities in Saudi Arabia have been supported by IAEA Technical \nCo-operation activities , most recently in 2019 with an Integrated Nuclear Infrastructure Review \nMission and workshops on “Developing a Policy and Strategy on Nuclear Fuel Cycle” and \n“Uranium Production Feasibility Studies: Processing , Economic , Social and Environmental \nAspects” , all of which focused on the front -end and back -end of the nuclear fuel cycle , as well \nas project management.  \nUzbekistan  reported both resource s and production for this edition of the Red Book, but only \nrelated to that of the Navoi Mining and Metallurgy Combinat (NMMC) . In December 2019, it was \nreported that France and Uzbekistan had established the French- Uzbek uranium joint venture , \nthe Nurliku m Mining LLC , which is 51% owned by Orano and 49% by Uzbekistan’s State Committee \non Geological and Mineral Resources (GoscomGeology). Nurlikum Mining will conduct uranium \nexploration and mining operations throughout Uzbekistan , focusing on sandstone -type uranium \nmineralisation in the Djengeldi region of Kyzylkum province. Orano will contribute capital and \ntechnology to the JV , while the Uzbekistan side will contribute historical exploration results. \nNurlikum’s first field exploration commenced in 2020 and consisted of 40 drill holes. The planned \nexploration campaign for 2021 envisioned the drilling of around 300 boreholes.  \nURANIUM SUPPLY  \n72 URANIUM 2022: RESOURCES, PRODUCTI ON AND DEMAND, NEA No. 7634, © OECD 2023  South -eastern Asia  \nUranium exploration and mine development activities in the South- eastern Asia region amounted \nto <1% of total reporte d global expenditures throughout the period 2018 to 2021. Ongoing \nexploration in Indonesia and Viet Nam , along with investigations into uranium processing in Viet \nNam , were reported for this edition of the Red Book , although associated expenditures in Viet  \nNam have not been reported since 2017.  \nIn Indonesia , exploration expenditures declined from USD  121 000 in 2017 to USD  81 000 in \n2018, then increased to USD 246 000 in 2019 before dropping t o USD 42 000 in 2020 and \nUSD  25 000 in 2021. A drilling programme of 425  m (6 holes) to test for mineralisation in alkaline \nlava flows was executed for 2019, as well as detailed geological mapping of lateritic soil in \neastern Takandeang , re-evaluation of previously discovered anomalous radiometric values in \nHarau and re connaissance geological, geochemical , and radiometric mapping , and radon \nmeasurements , in Melawi. In 2020, exploration was conducted in the Mamujui (radon surveys \nand geochemistry of drill core) , Bangka Island (detailed radiometric and radon surveys , and \nspectral logging measurements in 13 holes [20 -70 m depth] that tested a placer deposit) , and \nMelawi regions (preliminary grid -based radon surveys).  \nIn Viet Nam , uranium mineralisation is associated with rare earth element deposits (Lao Cai \nprovince) , phosp hate deposits (Cao Bang province), and sandstone and coal deposits (Quang Nam \nprovince). Government uranium exploration expenditures amounted to USD  1.8 million and \n1.5 million in 2016 and 2017, respectively , but no expenditures have been reported since.  \nActivities to estimate uranium potential of 12 orebodies in the Palua -Parong area were \nundertaken from 2016 to 2019. In support of these efforts , research on ore leaching treatment \nmethods , laboratory and pilot -scale tests, as well as investigations on the  management of mining \nwastes and tailings , have been carried out by the Institute for Technology of Radioactive and Rare \nElements (ITRRE). The results show that the heap leach method is suitable for the low -grade  \nParong ore , with uranium recovery greater t han 75% achieved.  \nCurrent ITRRE activities are focused on the recovery of thorium and uranium from rare earth \nconcentrates , and a continuous counter -current extraction process for the simultaneous recovery \nof thorium and uranium from the Yen Phu rare earth concentrate leach solutions was developed. \nSeparation of thorium and uranium from xenotime leach solutions was achieved by solvent \nextraction using primary and tertiary amines. Results show that the extraction method is suitable for the recovery of thoriu m and uranium from rare earth concentrate with thorium and uranium \npurities of greater than 99%. Uranium exploration and research on uranium extraction from uranium ores are continuing but no production centre has been planned to date.  \nEast Asia \nUranium exploration and mine development expenditures in the East Asia region amounted to \n25% and 30% of total global expenditures in 2018 and 2019 respectively , before dropping to <1% \nof global expenditures in 2020 and 2021, since expenditures in China  for these years were not \nreported and only expenditures in Mongolia  were made available for this edition of the Red Book.  \nChina  did not respond to the questionnaire for this edition of the Red Book. Total non -\ndomestic development expenditures by China  had decreased from USD 378 million in 2016 to \nUSD  108.1 million in 2017 , USD  41.5 million in 2018 and USD  23.6 million in 2019 , as the \nacquisition and subsequent ramp up in development of the Husab mine in Namibia was completed. Husab was acquired in 2012 by Uranium Res ources Co. , Ltd, a subsidiary of state -\nowned China General Nuclear Power Group (CGN).  \nIn addition to development of the Husab mine , overseas expenditures have been reported for \nseveral other uranium projects mainly in Kazakhstan, Namibia and Niger. In 2006 , the state -\nowned China National Nuclear Corporation (CNNC) signed an agreement to develop the Azelik -\nAbokurum deposit in Niger , but after about 670 tU were produced the mine was idled in 2014 and \nit is unlikely to be restarted. CNNC purchased a 25% equit y stake of the Langer Heinrich uranium \nmine from Paladin Energy, acquiring a total of 934 tU under the shareholders’ equity in 2017, prior \nto the mine being idled. On 26 November  2018, CNNC signed a share -sale agreement with Rio \n URANIUM SUPPLY  \nURANIUM 2022: RESOURCES, PRODUCTION AND DEMAND, NEA No. 7634, © OECD 2023  73 Tinto to buy a 68.62% equit y stake of the Rössing  uranium mine in Namibia. CGN is also in a \npartnership with Kazatomprom for the Semizbay and Irkol ISL mines in Kazakhstan and in May \n2014 agreed to buy uranium from Uzbekistan through to 2021 for USD  800 million.  \nDomestic uranium ex ploration and mine development expenditures in China were relatively \nstable from 2016 to 2018 but were expected to increase to USD  154 million in 2019. Over 90% of \nthese expenditures were exploration related.  In response to the challenges brought about by \nsustained low uranium prices and efforts to meet ecological goals announced by the central \ngovernment , Chinese uranium companies reorganised in 2017 and 2018 and a domestic industry \nfocused on production dominated by ISL in northern China, supplemented by underground \nmining in southern China was developed , and the main exploration effort was shifted to ISL.  \nIndustrial ISL tests , carried out in some parts of the Erdos and Erlian sandstone -type \nuranium deposits in Inner Mongolia , produced encouraging results  that may result in these \ndeposits becoming the principal uranium production centres in China.  \nOver the past several years , the IAEA has supported  China through the Technical Co -operation \nprogramme. Some of the most recent projects include the project “De veloping Exploration \nTechniques for Deep Blind Deposits in Typical Hydrothermal Uranium Ore Fields” , which was \nconducted from 2014 to 2016; “Studying Identification Technology and Technical Economic \nEvaluation of Typical Sandstone -hosted Concealed Uranium Deposits” , which began in 2018; \n“Implementing Exploration Techniques for Paleochannel Sandstone -Hosted Uranium Deposits \nand Fluid -Rock Interaction in In- Situ Leaching Processes” , which carried out from 2020 to 2021; \nand the current project , “Evaluating the  Technical and Economic Viability of Uranium Resources \nin Different Exploration Stages” , which started in 2022.  \nJapan reported an increase in non- domestic government exploration development \nexpenditures from USD 2.2 million in 2017 and 2018 to 3.2 million in 2019, with a subsequent \ndecline to 3.1 million in 2020 and USD 2.6 million expected in 2021. The Japan -Canada Uranium \nCo. Ltd (JCU) , which took over JNC’s Canadian mining interests, is continuing exploration activities \nin Canada while JOGMEC continues e xploration activities in Uzbekistan and Namibia. Japanese \nprivate companies hold shares in companies developing uranium mines and in those operating \nmines in Australia , Canada, Kazakhstan and Niger. In December 2019, Uzbekistan agreed to sell \nuranium to tw o Japanese trading companies. Uzbekistan signed separate contracts with ITOCHU \n(valued at USD  636.4 million) and Marubeni (valued at USD  510.1 million) with both agreements \ncovering uranium deliveries between 2023 and 2030.  \nIn Mongolia , reported domestic exploration and development expenditures by industry \ndeclined from USD  4.9 million in 2018 to USD 158 000 in 2019, then to USD 71 000 in 2020 before \npicking up to USD 74 000 in 2021. No development expenditures were reported. Exploration drilling \nin 2019 t otalled 1  100 m with none reported in 2020 and 2021, a sharp decline from peak drilling \nof 23  655 m in 2017. Four companies are engaged in exploration activities in Mongolia focusing on \nthe identification of sandstone -type uranium mineralisation amenable t o ISL mining.  \nMajor exploration activities during 2019 -2020 were conducted by Badrakh Energy on the ISL \namenable Zuuvch Ovoo and Dulaan uul uranium deposits in southeast Mongolia. As a result , \nuranium resources  of the Zuuvch ovoo deposit were increased to 93 291 tU in situ and a technical \nreport was submitted to the Mongolian Professional Committee of Resources in February 2020.  \nAfter receipt of all required authorisations from government authorities including validation of an environmental impact assessme nt and environmental management plan, a pilot ISL test was \nstarted in 2021. On 10 August  2021, the first kg of uranium concentrate was produced. Operations \nwere planned to continue in 2022 to provide information confirming key technical and economical \npara meters for future industrial production.  \nAn IAEA Technical Co -operation project , Regional Asia Pacific , was initiated in 2016 and \ncontinued through 2019. The project , “Conducting the Comprehensive Management and Recovery \nof Radioactive and Associated Mine ral Resources” , is aimed at supporting member states in the \nAsia -Pacific region in developing sustainable mining of deposits with associated radioactive \nminerals. Uranium production is one potential aspect of economic development in the region \nwhere balanc ing consumption and production is of interest. Though the region (especially China) \nis expected to grow significantly in terms of nuclear power production , a large part of the current \nURANIUM SUPPLY  \n74 URANIUM 2022: RESOURCES, PRODUCTI ON AND DEMAND, NEA No. 7634, © OECD 2023  and future uranium requirements is expected to be met by imports. Though  potential for \nincreasing domestic uranium production exists, several factors preventing this from materialising \nwill be addressed to strengthen capacities through the establishment of centres of excellence in \nmember states. Other IAEA support includes a T echnical Co -operation project , “Developing \nHuman Resources in Nuclear Science and Establishing Electron Beam Capacities for Flue Gas” , \nwhich started in 2018 , and most recently in 2022 , an Integrated Uranium Production Cycle Review \nMission for the Mongolian  Nuclear Energy Commission.  \nPacific  \nUranium exploration and mine development expenditures in the Pacific region (i.e.  Australia ) \naccounted for about 2% of total global expenditures reported for this edition of the Red Book \nfrom 2018 through 2021. Mine development activities slowed , however , after government \napprovals were obtained , as developers await improved market conditions before bringing these \nprojects into production.  \nIn Australia , domestic exploration expenditures by industry continued to decline from \nUSD 15.1 million in 2017 to USD  9.0 million in 2018 , USD 7.1 million in 2019 and USD 4.6 million in \n2020, with a rise to USD 6.9 million expected in 2021. During this period , uranium exploration was \nmost active around known resources in Western Australia and South Australia , as low uranium \nmarket prices limited greenfield activity.  \nIn Western Australia , Vimy Resources was granted government approvals for the Mulga \nRock project in March 2017 , released a definitive feasibility study in 2018, and in  September 2021 \nthe Western Australian Department of Mines , Industry Regulation and Safety approved the \nMulga Rock Mining Proposal and associated Mine Closure Plan. The project involves shallow \nopen -pit mining of 4 polymetallic deposits, with 1  346 tU prod uced annually over 15 years. The \nYeelirrie project , one of the world’s largest surficial uranium deposits, received environmental \napproval from the Western Australia government in January 2017 and the Commonwealth \ngovernment in April 2019. Wholly owned by Cameco Australia Pty Ltd , production of nearly \n3 300 tU per annum over 19 years utilising open -pit mining and alkaline leach technology is \nplanned. The unconformity -related Kintyre uranium deposit , also wholly owned by Cameco \nAustralia Pty Ltd , is planned to produce 2  290 tU per annum over 15 years. Suited for open -pit \nmining with the uppermost parts of the resource 50 m below surface , Kintyre secured \nenvironmental approval for the Kintyre project in 2015 from both the Commonwealth and \nWestern Australian go vernments. Toro Energy Ltd , the owner of the Wiluna project , a surficial \ncalcrete -hosted regional resource comprised of six deposits , received environmental approvals \nfrom the Western Australian government and the Commonwealth in 2017. A shallow strip \nexca vation to a maximum depth of 15 m is planned , with alkaline agitated leaching in tanks at \nelevated temperatures to process the ore. Production is estimated to be approximately 577 tU per \nannum . All four of the projects , poised to enter production , are on h old until uranium market \nconditions improve.  \nIn South Australia, the sandstone -type Honeymoon deposit , operated by Boss Energy Ltd , is \napproved for mining and exploration , and metallurgical test work continued with total identified , \nrecoverable resources o f 23 306 tU. In June 2021, Boss Energy released an Enhanced Feasibility \nStudy and in June 2022 the company announced a final investment decision to develop the \nHoneymoon project with a first uranium production scheduled for Q4 2023 ramping up to about \n940 tU within 3 years.  \nThrough 2019 and 2020, Australian -listed mineral companies were involved in exploration \nactivities for uranium in countries such as Namibia and Tanzania. However , non- domestic \nexpenditures were not reported for this edition and the past several editions.   \n URANIUM SUPPLY  \nURANIUM 2022: RESOURCES, PRODUCTION AND DEMAND, NEA No. 7634, © OECD 2023  75 Uranium production  \nIn 2020, 17 countries produced uranium , with t he global total amounting to 47  342 tU. \nKazakhstan’s continuous growth in production came to an end  in 2017 as production cuts were \ninstituted to reduce supply to an oversupplied market. Nonetheless, Kazakhstan remained by far \nthe world’s largest producer , even as production was eased ba ck from 21  705 tU in 2018 to \n19 447 tU in 2020. Kazakhstan’s produc tion alone in 2020 amounted to more than the combined \nproduction in that year from Australia , Namibia , Canad a and Uzbekistan , respectively the second , \nthird , fourth and fifth largest producers of uranium that year. Germany and Hungary  were the \nonly countri es that reported their entire 2020 uranium production from mine remediation \nactivities (a combined total of 10 tU). In the recent past , both Germany  and France  had been \nreporting a few tU of production through remediation activities, but they are unlikely to produce \nuranium by this means in the coming years as remediation has resulted in reduced amounts of \nuranium in water captured and treated during the remediation process. In Germany , future water \ntreatment at the Königstein mine site will still be requir ed but without any special separation of \nuranium.

Canada’s \nproduction declined sharply , dropping it to the 4th place (3 878 tU) , as some key facilities were idled \nbecause of poor market conditions and COVID -19 pandemic work restrictions limited activities at \nothers. Australia  moved up to 2nd place as production declined much less so than in Canada. \nUzbekistan  continued to rank as the 5th largest producer i n 2020 with production of 3  512 tU. The \ntop five producing countries (Kazakhstan, Australia , Namibia , Canada and Uzbekistan ) dominated \nuranium production , accounting for 82% of world production in 2020. Ten countries: Kazakhstan  \n(41.1%) , Australia  (13.1%) , Namibia  (11.4%) , Canada (8.2%) , Uzbekistan  (7.4%) , Niger  (6.3%) , Russia  \n(6.0%) , China (3.4%) , Ukraine  (1.5%) and India  (1.1%) accounted fo r over 99% of world production in \n2020 (Figure 1.5). \nOverall , world uranium production increased slightly (1.8 %) from 53  501 tU in 2018 to 54 478 tU \nin 2019, then declined by 1 3% to 47  342 tU in 2020 as producers instituted production cuts to reduce \nsupply in a saturated market. These planned reductions were greatest in Canada and Kazakhstan. \nProduction also declined dramatically in the United States  as mine production was suspen ded at \nseveral facilities due to an unfavourable market (Table  1.18). Within OECD countries, production \ndecreas ed from 21  521 tU in 2016 to 13 838 tU in 2018 and 13 693 in 2019, primarily due to planned \nproduction cuts in Canada and declining production in  the United  States . It then dropped (26%) to \n10 120 tU in 2020 and further to 8 477 tU in 2021 as operations at the Ranger mine in Australia \nwound down before closing in early 2021.  \nWorld production was expected to increase marginally (0.3%) to 47 472 tU in 2021 , mainly \ndue to continued production cuts in Canada and Kazakhstan , as well as declining production in \nAustralia  following closure of Ranger mine and in Niger  following closure of Cominak. In Canada , \nmining at Rabbit Lake was suspended in mid -2016, then mining at the McArthur River and \nmilling at Key Lake was suspended at the end of January 2018, all due to low uranium prices. In \n2017, Kazatomprom announced that it planned to reduce production by a total of 20% through \n2021 to better align production  by the world’s largest producer with demand. On 19  August 2020 , \nKazatomprom announced that it intended to extend its plan to flex down production by 20% \nthrough 2022 (WNA , 2020a).  \nIn addition to planned production cuts , the COVID -19 global pandemic has also affected \noperations in several uranium producing countries. In Canada, on 23  March  2020, Cameco \nannounced that it had suspended production at the Cigar Lake mine and Orano announced that it had suspended work at the Mc Clean Lake mill in response to the pandemic. In Kazakhstan, on \n7 April  2020, JSC National Atomic Company Kazatomprom announced that it was reducing \noperational activities at all uranium mines for a period of three months due to the pandemic. In Namibia , activity at the Rössing mine was temporarily reduced to a minimum , and in Australia , a \ntemporary suspension of travel by in -bound workers was imposed on the Ranger mine , and at \nOlympic Dam , measures were implemented across the operation to reduce virus risk.  Work \nrestrictions have since been eased but at the time of writing , it is not clear how COVID -19 \npandemic induced work restrictions on mining and milling will impact future uranium production and further disruption caused by the pandemic could ripple through the industry, constricting \nglobal supply of mined uranium.  \nIn 2021, Kazatomprom announced that it planned to continue its market -centric strategy \nand discipline by maintaining 2023 production at a similar level to 2022 , which is expected to be \n20% lower than the planned volumes under its Subsoil Use Contracts. It also indicated that it does not expect to return to full Subsoil Use Contract production levels until a sustained market recovery is evident (Kazatomprom , 2021). In early 2022 , Cameco announced  that it intended to \ngradually resume production at the McArthur River mine and Key Lake mill by 2024, but at 40% \nbelow the annual licensed capacity of the operations (Cameco, 2022).  \n URANIUM SUPPLY  \nURANIUM 2022: RESOURCES, PRODUCTION AND DEMAND, NEA No. 7634, © OECD 2023  79 Present status of uranium production  \nNorth America  \nNorth American production of 3 886  tU amounted to 8% of world production in 2020 , as \nproduction declined by 3 387  tU (47%) since 2018. This decrease is due to production cuts \nimplemented because of an oversupplied market and COVID -19 work restrictions in Canada, \nand reduced competitiveness of US production in an oversupplied , low-price market during a \nlengthy period.  \nCanada lost its standing as the world’s largest producer in 2009 due to production increases \nin Kazakhstan, and although it remains the dominant North American p roducer , it dropped from \nsecond to the world’s fourth -largest producer in 2020, behind Australia and Namibia. Current \nCanadian uranium production is well below the full licensed production capacity of over 25 000  tU \nat the existing uranium mills. Production in 2020 was 3 878 tU (its lowest level since 1975), 44% \nbelow 2019 production of 6 944 tU, as operations were suspended for six months due to the \nCOVID -19 pandemic. The Cigar Lake mine and McClean Lake mill were returned to production in \nApril 2021. Oper ations at the McArthur River mine and Key Lake mill have been suspended since \nJanuary 2018 in response to low uranium market prices and  Canadian production will increase \nfurther when operations at McArthur River and Key Lake resume.  \nMcArthur River mine has  remaining identified recoverable resources of 154  100 tU with an \naverage grade of 5.5%  U. The Key Lake mill , also idled , recovered 61 tU from cleaning the mill \ncircuits in 2018 and 6.1 tU in 2019, but there was no uranium produced at the mill in 2020.  \nThe Rabbit Lake production centre was idled in mid -2016 due to low uranium prices and the \nfacility was placed in care and maintenance. Exploratory drilling at the Eagle Point mine during \nthe last several years has increased identified resources to 27 000 tU a t an average grade of \n0.63%  U. \nThe Cigar Lake mine , with recoverable resources of 111 100 tU at an average grade of 11%  U, \nwas the world’s largest producing uranium mine in 2019. However , production decreased by 44% \nin 2020 due to the COVID -19 pandemic. The McClean Lake mill produced 6  938 tU and 3 878 tU \nfrom Cigar Lake ore in 2019 and 2020, respectively. In December 2020, Orano purchased the 7.5% \nshare of the McClean Lake production centre that was held by Overseas Uranium Resources Development (Canada)  Co. Ltd , a subsidiary of Overseas Uranium Resources Development \nCorporation of Japan.  \nIn February 2022, Cameco announced that it planned to restart the McArthur River mine \nand Key Lake mill in 2024, operating at reduced capacity , in line with the company’s supply \ndiscipline strategy that will continue until the uranium market improves and Cameco has \nsigned long -term contracts for its in -ground inventory of uranium. In 2024 , it plans to produce \n15 million lbs U\n3O8 (5 770 tU) at McArthur River/ Key La ke, 40% below the annual licensed \ncapacity of the operation , and 13.5 million lbs U 3O8 (5 190 tU) at Cigar Lake, 25% below its annual \nlicensed capacity. Total planned production in 2022 continues to face risks due to the ongoing COVID -19 pandemic and relat ed global supply chain disruptions , including at Cigar Lake , where \n15 million pounds U\n3O8 (5 770 tU) are expected to be produced , which is 20% below the facility’s \nlicensed capacity (Cameco , 2022).  \nUranium mines in the United States  produced 67  tU in 2019,  76% less than in 2018 (277 tU). \nData on 2020 production were withheld because of the limited number of companies actively \nmining. Production in 2019 came from seven facilities: six ISR plants in Nebraska and Wyoming \n(Crow Butte Operation , Lost Creek Proje ct, Ross CPP , North Butte , Nichols Ranch , and Smith Ranch-\nHighland Operation) and one underground mine. When mined , uranium ore from underground \nmining is stockpiled and eventually shipped to the White Mesa Mill for milling into U 3O8 \nconcentrate.  \nIn March 2022, the EIA reported that in the last quarter of 2021 , a total of 9  978 lbs U 3O8 \n(3.8 tU) had been produced from three facilities in the United States: Nichols Ranch (ISL), the \nRoss central processing plant and the Crowe Butte operation in Nebraska , up 88% from the third \nquarter production of 5  297 lbs U 3O8 (2.0 tU). No uranium was produced in the first two -quarters \nURANIUM SUPPLY  \n80 URANIUM 2022: RESOURCES, PRODUCTI ON AND DEMAND, NEA No. 7634, © OECD 2023  of 2021 (EIA 2022). This information , although not complete , suggests that uranium production \nhad declined to as low as 8  tU in 2020 and 4 tU in 2021.  \nAt the end of 2020, the Lost Creek and Smith Ranch- Highland in situ recovery (ISR) \noperations in Wyoming were operating with a combined theoretical (nominal) annual capacity \nof 7.5  million pounds of U 3O8 (2 900 tU). Nine ISR p lants were on standby at the end of 2020, and \nnine ISR plants were planned throughout four states: New Mexico , South Dakota , Texas and \nWyoming. One uranium mill (White Mesa in Utah) was  operating with a capacity of 1  814 metric \ntonnes of ore per day. Durin g 2019, the White Mesa Mill did not produce any uranium. In 2020 , \nWhite Mesa produced about 70 tU from reprocessed on -site pond water and alternative feed \nmaterial. Alternative feed material includes uranium extracted during municipal water \ntreatment, proc ess residues from uranium conversion , uranium -bearing tails from other metal \nrecovery operations , and others. Two mills (Shootaring Canyon in Utah and Sweetwater in \nWyoming), with a combined capacity of 3  402 metric tonnes of ore per day , remained on stand by \nstatus. Both mills have been on standby status since the early 1980s and will require \nrehabilitation to operate again.  \nThe United States has a number of conventional and ISR -amenable mines and deposits with \nsome degree of permitting or development. Mos t of these are indefinitely paused , awaiting more \nfavourable market conditions. ISR mining and exploration is mostly conducted in Texas and \nWyoming , and conventional mine -related activity is in the part of the Colorado Plateau that \nincludes Colorado, Utah , New Mexico and Arizona.  \nMany uranium mining and exploration companies were hopeful that supportive \nrecommendations would emerge from the Nuclear Fuel Working Group established in July 2019 , \nin response to a Section 232 Petition from two United States uran ium miners. On 23  April  2020 , \nthe United States Department of Energy released the Administration’s Nuclear Fuel Working Group strategy with recommendations to revitalise and strengthen the front end of the nuclear \nfuel cycle and the domestic nuclear indust ry. One of the recommendations of this group was to \ncreate a national strategic uranium reserve from domestically produced uranium over a ten -year \nperiod. In December 2020, a United States federal budget was enacted that included the first year \nof funding for developing this uranium reserve. DOE will administer the USD 150 million /year plan, \nwhich is slated to buy uranium directly from domestic mines and support domestic conversion \noperations. These developments, along with increased uranium market prices , have led to US \nuranium producers reportedly making plans to increase production from facilities in Wyoming and Utah by improving efficiencies , as well as accelerating development of other properties (WNA , \n2022b). Geopolitical tensions in eastern Europe can  be expected to further incentivise domestic \nuranium production.  \nSouth America  \nThere has been no uranium production in South America since 2015 , except for 30 tU produced \nduring the commissioning process for mining the Engenho deposit in Brazil  in 2021. Wo rk \ncontinues in Argentina  to restart production at the Sierra Pintada mine and to develop a new \nproduction centre for the Cerro Solo deposit. In Brazil , the licensing process to mine the \nremainder of the Cachoeira deposit (Lagoa Real) by underground methods is under way , and the \nexpansion of the Lagoa Real , Caetité unit to 670  tU/year is also progressing , including \ncommissioning of the Engenho deposit , with completion expected in 2027. Development of the \nSanta Quitéria phosphate/uranium project remain s in progress , with production currently \nscheduled to begin in 2024.  \nIn Argentina , domestic uranium requirements are increasing as the country’s nuclear \ngenerating capacity is increasing , incentivising domestic production. However , regulatory and \nenvironme ntal issues remain to be addressed before uranium production can resume. In 2018, \nthe 2013 update of an environmental impact assessment (EIA) for restarting production at the San Rafael mining -milling complex (Sierra Pintada mine) was presented to provincial \nauthorities , who reached a favourable technical opinion , and a mandatory public hearing was \nheld in 2019 with positive outcomes , resulting in provincial authorities approving the EIA.  \n URANIUM SUPPLY  \nURANIUM 2022: RESOURCES, PRODUCTION AND DEMAND, NEA No. 7634, © OECD 2023  81 However , before restarting uranium production at San Rafael , it will also be necessary to \nobtain both provincial approval and agreement to amend the provincial law that prevents the use \nof sulphuric acid and other chemicals that may be used in the operation. Technical feasibility has \nbeen partially demonstrated by the fact that this deposit was previously in operation , using the \nacid heap leach processing method. However , other alternatives have been considered for possible \nfuture production , including the use of alkaline leaching , bioleaching and vat leaching. Also , given \nthe possibility of reopening the mining -milling complex , all available data have been processed to \nrefine the geological model and formulate more suitable mining and processing.  \nCNEA continues developing feasibility studies for the proposed mining of the Ce rro Solo \ndeposit (Chubut Province) and several laboratory -scale tests have been carried out to determine \nthe most economically competitive milling process , including possible by -product molybdenum \nproduction. The project has been placed on standby because , in addition to technical \nconsiderations , a provincial law preventing open -pit mining remains in effect and a provincial \nregulatory framework for mining needs to be developed.  \nUntil 2021, no production had been reported in Brazil  following mining of t he entire open -\npit portion of the Cachoeira deposit (Lagoa Real , Caetité ) in 2014 , until the commissioning process \nof the Engenho deposit began in Brazil in 2021 . Both the licensing process to mine the remainder \nof the Cachoeira deposit by underground methods and resource reassessments are under way , \nwith full scale expanded production expected to begin in 2027.  \nThe expansion of the Lagoa Real , Caetité unit to 670  tU/year is also progressing , with \ncompletion expected in 2027. The expansion involves replacement of the heap leaching process \nby conventional agitated leaching and an overall investment estimated to amount to \nUSD  90 million.  \nSince 2014, Industrias Núcleares do Brasil S.A. (INB) has been working on the development \nof the Engenho deposit , with the commissioning process beginning in 2019 -2020 without \nsignificant production. Mine production amounted to 30 tU in 2021. Initially , Engenho was \nplanned as an additional ore source for increased production at the Caetité plant , but it is \ncurrently the only sourc e of ore for the mill due to the delay in commissioning the Cachoeira \nunderground mine.  \nDevelopment of the Santa Quitéria phosphate/uranium project , under the terms of an INB -\nBrazilian fertiliser producer partnership agreement , remains in progress. In 201 2, the project \noperators applied for a construction licence that was denied in 2018. INB and its partner worked \non a new model for the project and a revised licence application was filed in 2020 , with a \ndecision expected in 2022. The operation is currently  scheduled to begin in 2024.  \nEuropean Union  \nPrimary uranium production in the European Union (EU) for 2020 was from only one country, the Czech Republic, which produced 28 tU by ISL. Total reported EU production in 2020 was 44 tU, \nan increase of 13% from the 39 tU reported fo r 2018. With the end of mining at Rozná in the \nCzech Republic in 2017, and a new law enacted in 2021 that ends the issuance of new permits \nfor exploitation of radioactive mineral deposits in Spain, EU production should continue to \ndecline as uranium recove ry from mine remediation declines as remediation proceeds.  \nThe Czech Republic  also recovered 6 tU in ongoing mine water treatment in remediation \nactivities , while Germany and Hungary  contributed 7 tU and 3  tU, respectively , from mine \nremediation activities only. France  had also been producing minor amounts as a by -product of \nmine remediation activities but reported no uranium production in this fashion from 2018 to \n2021. In Germany , where all uranium production since 1992 has  been from remediation \nactivities at the Königstein mine , uranium will no longer be separated and recovered owing to \nthe decreasing content of uranium and heavy metals in the flood waters in recent years.  \nEurope (non- EU) \nOutput from non- EU countries in Eu rope in 2020 amounted to 3 557 tU, a 4% decrease from 2018. \nProduction declined in Russia  by 58  tU and in Ukraine by 79  tU over this two -year period. \nURANIUM SUPPLY  \n82 URANIUM 2022: RESOURCES, PRODUCTI ON AND DEMAND, NEA No. 7634, © OECD 2023  Production by non -EU countries in Europe in 2020 accounted for about 8% of total global \nproduction.  \nIn 202 0, uranium production in Russia , carried out by three enterprises that are part of the \nuranium mining company Uranium Holding ARMZ (JSC Atomredmetzoloto), amounted to 2  846 tU, \nof which 1 240 tU was obtained by traditional undergr ound mining at Priargunsky (120 tU of this \ntotal by heap leaching) and 1 606 tU by ISL. Since 2018, uranium production in Russia by \nunderground mining has decreased by 15% , whereas ISL production has increased by 11%.  \nDuring 2018 -2020, construction of the Mine No.  6 surface comple x and infrastructure \nelements continued at Priargunsky (design capacity of 2  300 tU/yr) for the development of the \nArgunskoye and Zherlovoye deposits , with the start of mining scheduled for 2026. ISL uranium \nmining of deposits at the Khiagda ore field (rec overable resources of 25 133 tU) in the Republic \nof Buryatia by JSC Khiagda continued and , in 2020, developme nt of the Kolichikan deposit \n(6 530 tU RAR) and the Dybryn deposit (6 634 tU RAR) began , with mining expected to begin in \n2021 and 2023, respective ly. In addition , JSC Dalur (Kurgan Oblast) started preparations for pilot \nuranium mining at the Dobrovolnoye deposit in 2020. Development of deposits in the Elkon \nuranium region has been suspended due to unfavourable market conditions.  \nIn Ukraine , 2020 production amounted to 711  tU (623 tU by conventional mining and 88 tU \nby heap leaching) , all of which was produced at three underground mines located in the central \nUkrainian ore province (Ingulska , Smolinska and Novokostyantynivska). Production in 2020 \ndeclined by 10% from 790 tU in 2018 and was expected to decline more sharply to 455 tU in 2021. \nLong -term government plans include mining the Safonivske deposit by ISL (ISL operations were \nconducted from 1966 to 1983 at the Devladovske and Bratske deposits that are now being monitored after decommissioning), as well as developing the Severinskie and Podgaytsevske \ndeposits for underground mining. The Energy Strategy of Ukraine to 2035, which was approved \nby government in 2017, set a target that all uranium re quirements for the Ukrainian nuclear \nfleet must be met entirely by domestic production , up from the 30% of requirements produced \ndomestically in 2020.  \nAfrica  \nAfrican production decreased by 3% , from 8 744 tU in 2018 to 8 465 tU in 2020, accounting for about \n18% of global production. Production in Namibia  continued to rise as the Husab operation moved \ncloser to full production capacity and production at Rössing increased in recent years. However , \nthe Rössing mine is scheduled to close at t he end of 2026. Norasa , Etango and other projects under \ndevelopment would more than compensate for the upcoming Rössing closure , should they be \nsuccessfully brought into production. In  Niger , production amounted to just under 3 000 tU in 2019 \nand 2020 as p roduction at the Somaïr (Arlit) open -pit mine has been lowered by 30% since 2015 \ndue to weak market conditions. On 31  March  2021, due to the exhaustion of ore and high operating \ncosts, Cominak’s Akouta mine ceased production after nearly 50 years of servic e. Production in  \nSouth  Africa  declined from 346 tU in 2018 to 62 tU in 2020 as depressed market conditions and \nCOVID -19 work restrictions limited production , but production is expected to increase to 192 tU in \n2021.  \nIn 2020, Lotus Resources Ltd (the new ow ner of the idled Kayelekera mine in Malawi ), \nconducted a restart scoping study of the uranium production centre. Two scenarios were considered:  treating only high grade material and treating the medium -grade stockpiles at the \nend of the life of mine after high grade material is exhausted. The restart of Kayelekera is \nexpected to require an initial capital cost of USD 50 million , but no target date for the restart \nwas spe cified.  \nTotal uranium production in  Namibia  reached 3 593 tU in 2016 and increased to 4 221 tU in \n2017 and 5 520 tU in 2018. Start -up of the Husab mine is the main reason for these production \nincreases.  In 2020, uranium production in Namibia  amounted to 5 412 tU , 3 301 tU of which was \nproduced at Husab and 2 111 tU at Rössing. Production at the open -pit Husab mine reached \n1 140 tU in 2017, was ramped up to 3 026 tU in 2018 and maintained at a level 3 300 to 3 400 tU \nduring 2019 and 2020. The Husab mining fl eet will need to move 15 million tonnes of ore per \nyear from two separate open pits to feed a processing plant to produce the nameplate capacity \n URANIUM SUPPLY  \nURANIUM 2022: RESOURCES, PRODUCTION AND DEMAND, NEA No. 7634, © OECD 2023  83 of 5 700 tU per year. In 2019, Rio Tinto plc sold its 69% share of Rössing to the China  National \nUranium Corporation , a wholly owned subsidiary of the government -owned China  National \nNuclear Corporation. Production at Rössing Uranium has steadily increased over the last few \nyears as the mine has accessed higher -grade ore after the Phase 2 and 3 pushbacks and \nproduc tion levels increased gradually to 2  111 tU in 2020. The higher -grade material does , \nhowever , come with increased calcium content , thereby limiting processing plant throughput. \nTo process the higher calcium carbonate containing ores , the annual capacity of  the processing \nplant was reduced to 9.2 million tonnes per annum. The current mine plans foresee a cessation \nof Rössing production at the end of 2026. However , both the idled Langer Heinrich and Trekkopje \nproduction centres , as well as projects under deve lopment , are poised to begin production with \nimproved market conditions.  \nProduction in Niger  totalled 3 484 tU in 2017 and 2 878 tU in 2018, then increasing slightly to \n2 982 in 2019 and 2 991 tU in 2020. In 2019, Somaïr’s Arlit open -pit mine produced 1  912 tU and \nCominak produced 1 070 tU at the Akouta undergr ound mine. Production in 2020 amounted to \n2 991 tU , of which 1 879 tU were produced by Somaïr and 1 112 tU by Cominak. Production at \nthe Arlit open -pit mine has been lowered by 30% since 2015 due to w eak market conditions but \nit is expected to continue operating until the late 2020s as additional resources have been added \nover the last few years. On 31 March  2021 , due to the exhaustion of ore and high operating costs , \nproduction at Cominak’s Akouta min e was brought to a halt with cumulative production from \n1978 to the end of 2020 amounting to approximately 75 000 tU. It is expected that uranium production in Niger  will decrease by about 25% due to the Akouta mine shutdown from 2021 on \nuntil mines under development in the country , such as Imouraren , Dasa and Madouela, are \nbrought into production.   \nProduction in South Africa  declined from 346 tU in 2018 to 62 tU in 2020 but increased to \n192 tU in 2021 as COVID -19 work restrictions were lifted. However , depressed market conditions \ncontinue , making most operations in the country uneconomic , and production is limited. In \n2019 and 2020, uranium production came from the Harmony Gold Vaal River operation (Moab \nKnotsong mine). At the end of March 2020, the government imposed a 21 -day lockdown in \nresponse to the COVID -19 pandemic. As part of the lockdown , all mining operations (apart from \ncoal mines supplying Eskom) were initially suspended , then in mid -April 2020 they were \nallowed to resume mining at up to 50% o f normal capacity. Most of South Africa ’s historical \nuranium production was derived from quartz -pebble conglomerate deposits (a by -product of \ngold or , to a minor extent , copper) with a small proportion from the Palabora copper -bearing \ncarbonatite. Current production is sourced from the quartz -pebble conglomerate deposits and \nassociated tailings. Future production centres could include the Dominion Reef mine and Beaufort West deposit (Karoo Basin).  \nThe Witwatersrand Basin contains about 79% of total identified uranium resources in South  \nAfrica , in both the underground , hosted by quartz -pebble conglomerates , and their resulting \ntailings storage facilities. Approximately 47% of the total national identified resources are in the Witwatersrand underground operati ons, 28% in their associated tailings facilities , 20% in the \nSpringbok Flats Basin , and about 5% in the sandstone -hosted deposits of the Karoo Basin. The \nuranium pay limit in most parts of the Witwatersrand Basin is calculated on a by -product basis, \naccord ing to which the uranium is not classified as a resource unless it occurs in an area of gold \nmineralisation that satisfies the estimated gold cut -off grades. In addition , uranium production in \nthese projects only includes the costs of transporting ore from  the underground or tailings \noperations to the processing plants and the treatment of uranium , while gold carries all other \ncosts. The Witwatersrand Basin has a total of about 470 tailings storage facilities with uranium resources , most of which are not in cluded in reasonably assured and inferred conventional \nresource totals. Should uranium market conditions improve , uranium contained in South African \ngold mine tailings could be recovered to help meet demand.  \nWith improved market conditions uranium production in Africa could surge , as idled mines \nin Namibia  (Langer Heinrich , Trekkopje) and Malawi  (Kayelekera) could be returned to \nproduction in a relatively short time and mine development projects in Botswana  (Letlhakane) , \nMali  (Falea) , Mauritania (Tiris), Namibia  (Etango , Norasa , Marenica , Omahola , Wings), Niger  \n(Dasa, Madaouela , Imouraen) , Tanzania (Mkuju River) and Zambia  (Mutanga) are poised to be \nURANIUM SUPPLY  \n84 URANIUM 2022: RESOURCES, PRODUCTI ON AND DEMAND, NEA No. 7634, © OECD 2023  brought into production , potentially providing significant production capacity. Development of \nmany of these  projects has been stalled due to poor market conditions and , in 2020 and 2021, \nwork restrictions related to the COVID -19 pandemic.  \nMiddle East , Central and Southern Asia  \nProduction in the Middle East , Central and South Asia region declined by 8% from 25 605 tU in \n2018 to 23 595 tU in 2020. This was driven principally by the world’s largest producer , \nKazakhstan , where production was decreased from 21  705 tU in 2018 to 19 477  tU in 2020 by \nplanned production cuts. Despite this decline , Kazakhstan  accounted f or 41% of global \nproduction in 2020. India  and Pakistan  do not report production figures , but their combined total \nis estimated to be about 505  tU in 2019 and 585 tU in 2020. Neither Uzbekistan  nor Iran provided \ninformation for this report , but production in 2019 and 2020 is estimated to have amounted to \n3 500 tU/yr in Uzbekistan (maintaining its position as the world’s  fifth largest producer) and \n21 tU/yr in Iran.  \nIndia  continues to ramp up production capacity after commissioning the Tummalapalle mill \nin January 2017 , with plans to increase capacity at both the Tummalapalle and Turamdih mills \nfrom 3 000 to 4 500 t/day ore. However , the country does not report either production or \nproduction costs and the effect of increasing mill input on production is unce rtain. In April 2022 , \nit was reported that over the past three years , India has imported a total of 4  557.67 tU from \nKazatomprom and 2  988.37 tU from Cameco , all as natural uranium ore concentrate. It also \nimported 56.78 tU from TVEL, in the form of enriched uranium fuel pellets , with all imports from \nRussia taking place during 2019 and 2020 (WNA 2022c).  \nJordan  does not produce uranium but continues developing resources with the aim of doing \nso, working on production from surficial deposits in central Jord an as well as extracting uranium \nfrom phosphates. In 2021 , a pilot -scale uranium extraction plant was commissioned to fine -\ntune the developed process for extracting uranium from the local ores in central Jordan and to \ngenerate the technical data needed to finalise the detailed engineering of a commercial plant. \nMutual collaboration between Jordan and the IAEA enabled the establishment of on -site \nanalytical laboratories in 2020 to support exploration and extraction activities.  \nIn Kazakhstan,  all uranium was produced by the ISL method. In 2019 and 2020, uranium was \nmined at the Kanzhugan, Moinkum , Akdala , Uvanas , Mynkuduk , Inkai , Budenovskoye , North and \nSouth Karamurun, Irkol , Zarechnoye , Semizbay , Northern Kharasan deposits. With the largest \nshare (64%) of the world’s low -cost (<USD 40/kgU) resource base , with 95% of all identified uranium \nresources associated with existing and committed production centres and 27  000 tU/yr of \nproduction capacity , Kazakhstan can be expected to remain the world’s largest produ cer for the \nforeseeable future. On 2 July 2021, Kazatomprom announced that it planned to continue its \nmarket -centric strategy and discipline by maintaining 2023 production at a similar level to 2022 , \nwhich is expected to be 20% lower than the planned volum es under its Subsoil Use Contracts and \ndoes not expect to return to full Subsoil Use Contract production levels until a sustained market \nrecovery is evident , supply and demand conditions signal a need for more uranium , and the \ncompany’s pipeline of mid - to long -term contract negotiations implies that there is a low risk of \nproduced volumes further delaying the recovery (Kazatomprom , 2021).  \nUzbekistan  has produced uranium since 1946 and conducted the first ISL tests in 1968. Since \n1995, Uzbekistan has been p roducing uranium using only ISL technology and has developed and \nimplemented two new technologies of acid ISL for ores with high carbonate content. The first , \na bicarbonate –acid method that is used for ores with a carbonate content above 2% , reduces \nrepair  and restoration procedures for plugged wells by 2.5 -3 times. The second uses a mini -\nreagent technology that is applied to ores with a carbonate content >0.5% located in artesian \naquifers. Implementation of these two technologies has significantly reduced acid consumption \nand in turn operating costs by 20 -30%.   \n URANIUM SUPPLY  \nURANIUM 2022: RESOURCES, PRODUCTION AND DEMAND, NEA No. 7634, © OECD 2023  85 Uranium produced in Uzbekistan since 1992 has mainly been exported to China, India, South \nKorea and the United States. In May 2014 , China’s CGN agreed to buy USD  800 million of uranium \nthrough to 202 1. Uzbekistan’s state -owned Navoi Mining and Metallurgy Combinat (NMMC) has \nalso signed a contract to supply 2  000 tU to India from 2014 through 2018. In December 2019, \nUzbekistan agreed to sell uranium to two Japanese trading companies. Uzbekistan’s NMMC \nsigned separate contracts with ITOCHU (valued at USD  636.4 million) and Marubeni (valued at \nUSD  510.1 million), with both agreements covering uranium deliveries between 2023 and 2030. \nFrom 2015 to 2020, Uzbekistan has maintained an annual production of app roximately 3 300 tU \nto 3 500 tU.  \nEast Asia  \nChina, the only producing country in East  Asia , reported variable production from 1  650 tU in 2016 \nto 1 580 tU in 2017 and 1  620 tU in 2018 as the country transitions from higher cost underground \nmines , mainly in the south , to lower cost ISL production centres in the north. However , because \nproduction figures were not reported by China for 2020 and 2021, the Secretariat assumes that \nproduction has remained steady at 1 600 tU/yr.  \nIn response to the challenges broug ht about by sustained low uranium prices and efforts to \nmeet ecological goals set by the government of China , state -owned Chinese uranium companies \nwere reorganised in 2017 and 2018. Of the three hard -rock, underground uranium mines with \ndepleted uranium r esources or with high production costs, one (Qinglong) was closed for \ndecommissioning and operations at two others (Chingyi, Lantian) were idled. With improved \nuranium market conditions , the idled uranium production centres are expected to be brought back \ninto operation. The uranium industry’s focus of production has become dominated by ISL mining \nin northern China, supplemented by underground mining in southern China, and the principal \nexploration effort has shifted to ISL. ISL production capacity was expa nded at the Yining centre in \nthe Xinjiang Autonomous Region (north -west China) and the Tongliao centre in Inner Mongolia \n(north -east China) , but the level of capacity after these expansions is unknown.  \nPacific  \nAustralia  is the only producing country in th e Pacific region. Production remained relatively \nsteady at 6  526 tU in 2018 and 6 613 tU in 2019 , before declining to 6 195 tU in 2020. However , \nonly 3 817 tU are expected to be produced in 2021 as the Ranger mine ceased production on 8 January 2021. Minin g at Ranger Pit  3 concluded in December 2012, but stockpiled ore continued \nto be processed at the main metallurgical plant and the laterite treatment plant until operations \nceased. The Gundjeihmi Aboriginal Corporation advised the mine operator and owners in 2016 \nthat the Mirarr Traditional Owners do not support the creation of a new Ranger Authority , which \nwould have provided the regulatory mechanism to enable mining after 2021. Rehabilitation \nactivities at the Ranger site have commenced and are scheduled to be completed by January \n2026. Since operations began in 1981, more than 132 000 tonnes of uranium oxide concentrate \n(112 000 tU) were produced at the Ranger mine.  \nAustralia currently has five approved uranium mines , all in South Australia: Olympic Dam , \nHoneymoon , Beverley , Beverley North and Four Mile, with only Olympic Dam and Four Mile \nproducing uranium in 2020. Plans for a large expansion at Olympic Dam have been scaled back \nand although BHP plans for production to remain stable in the near term , it is anticipated that \noutput could increase over time through incremental production efficiency gains and \ninfrastructure investment. Mining at Beverley and Beverley North has now ceased and is currently working towards closure. Honeymoon (Boss Energ y) has been idled with all government approvals \nin place , and in June 2022 the company announced a final investment decision to develop the \nproject. Four uranium mining projects, all in Western Australia and all with government approvals \nto proceed are als o awaiting improved market conditions for further development: Kintyre and \nYeelirrie (Cameco Australia Pty Ltd), Wiluna (Toro Energy Ltd) , and Mulga Rock (Vimy Resources \nLtd). If Honeymoon and all four projects under development are successfully brought in to \nproduction , annual production capacity in Australia will increase by 8  000 tU.  \nURANIUM SUPPLY  \n86 URANIUM 2022: RESOURCES, PRODUCTI ON AND DEMAND, NEA No. 7634, © OECD 2023  Ownership  \nTable  1.19 shows the ownership of uranium production in the 17 countries that produced \nuranium in 2020 and Brazil , which did not produce in 2020 , but has produced recently. \nOwnership of production in 2020 has not changed since 2018. Domestic mining companies \ncontinued to control about 56% of production in 2020 , as in 2018. Domestic government \nparticipation increased from 37% in 2016 to 42% in 2018, owing to increase d shares in \nKazakhstan  and Namibia , whereas the share of domestic private companies declined from 18% \nin 2016 to 14% in 2018, as an increased share in Australia  offset a decline in Canada. Non -\ndomestic mining companies continued to control about 44% of production in 2020 (no change \nfrom 2018). It should be noted that for this reporting period , the percentage of control \n(i.e. government vs. private) of non -domestic mining companies , for both Australia  and the \nUnited  States , is not reported.  \nTable 1.19.

(a) Olympic Dam does not differentiate between copper, uranium, silver and gold production. Employment has \nbeen estimated for uranium- related activities. (b) Employment at mine sites only.  \nProduction methods  \nHistorically , uranium has been produced mainly using open -pit and underground mining \ntechniques , then processed by conventional uranium milling. Other mining methods include \nISL (sometimes referred to as ISR); co -product or by -product recovery from copper, gold and \nphos phate operations; heap leaching and in- place leaching (also referred to as stope or block \nleaching). Stope/block leaching involves the extraction of uranium from broken ore without \nremoving it from an underground mine , whereas heap leaching involves the us e of a leaching \nfacility on the surface after the ore has been mined. Small amounts of uranium are also recovered from mine water treatment and environmental restoration activities.  \nOver the past two decades , ISL mining , which uses either acid or alkaline solutions to extract \nthe uranium directly from the deposit , has become increasingly important. The uranium \ndissolving solutions are injected into and recovered from the ore -bearing zone using a system \nof wells. ISL technology is currently being used to ext ract uranium from sandstone deposits only \nand in recent years has become the dominant method of uranium production.  \nThe distribution of production by type of mining or “material sources” for 2018 through 2021 \nis shown in Table  1.22. The category “other met hods” includes recovery of uranium through the \ntreatment of water recovered during reclamation and decommissioning activities, and more \nrecently has also included production from refinery wastes and cleaning mill circuits in Canada.  \nISL technology continues to dominate uranium production , largely because of the rapid \ngrowth of this low -cost method of production in  Kazakhstan , and to a lesser extent in Australia , \nChina , Russia  and Uzbekistan . Note that not all countries report production by method , and for \nthis reporting period , the United States , where most production is by ISL , the information is not \nofficially reported. World uranium production by ISL amounted to 55.5% of total global \nproduction in 2018 , increasing 63.3% in 2021, owing to expected ISL production increases \n URANIUM SUPPLY  \nURANIUM 2022: RESOURCES, PRODUCTION AND DEMAND, NEA No. 7634, © OECD 2023  89 principally in Australia , China , Kazakhstan  and Russia . The decreasing share of underground \nmine production over this reporting period is mainly driven by decreases in Canada due to \ntemporary production cuts and in Niger  due to the  closure of the Cominak mine , and to a lesser \nextent in Russia  and Ukraine .  \nTable 1.22.

P rojections for 2025 to \n2040 are included for existing and committed production centres (A-II columns) and for existing , \ncommitted , planned and prospective production centres (B-II columns) in the <USD  130/kgU category \nfor countries that are either currentl y producing uranium or have plans and the potential to do \nso in the near future. Note that both the A -II and B -II scenarios are supported by currently \nidentified local RAR and IR in the <USD  130/kgU category , except in  Pakistan . Also  note that \nactual production seldom , if ever , matches full production capability.  \nSeveral current or potential uranium producing countries including Argentina, Botswana , \nChina, India , Mauritania, Mongolia , Namibia , Niger , Pakistan, South  Africa , Tanzania, Ukraine , the \nUnited  States , and Uzbekistan  did not officially report , or only partially reported , projected \nproduction capabilities to 2040. In some countries, the NEA/IAEA suggested updates to the \nsubmitted data to include recent and important changes sin ce the cut -off date for data submission. \nAs a result , estimates of production capability for many countries were developed by the \nNEA/IAEA using data submitted for past Red Books, company reports and other public data.  \nThe reported projected production cap abilities for existing and committed production centres \nfor 2025 are 69 675 tU in the A -II category and 83 105 tU in the B -II category, a decrease of 7 750 tU \nin the A -II category and an increase of 1 495  tU in the B -II category compared to 2025 production  \ncapability estimates reported in the 2020 edition of this report. Increased production capability \nwill likely not translate into increased production in the early 2020s because , as of May 2022 , \nuranium production was significantly below full production ca pability as mining was temporarily \nsuspended in some important producing countries and workforce limitations and work practice adjustments were implemented in response to the COVID -19 pandemic.  \nProjections beyond 2025 show generally decreasing global prod uction capabilities as A -II \ncategory estimates decline in response to depletion of resources at existing and committed production centres. In contrast , B-II production capability generally increases through to 2040 due \nto the development of several project s that are ready to produce with improved market conditions, \nparticularly in Australia , Canada, Namibia  and Niger . Only Brazil , Canada, Kazakhstan and Russia  \nURANIUM SUPPLY  \n90 URANIUM 2022: RESOURCES, PRODUCTI ON AND DEMAND, NEA No. 7634, © OECD 2023  reported production capability to 2040; the remaining projections to this date are NEA/IAEA \nestimates. These 2040 estimates show a decline in production capability from 2035 due to \ndepletion of local resources (RAR and IR) available at <USD  130/KgU. Neither India  nor Pakistan  \nreport production costs and these costs are considered high , likely above the cost threshold above , \nbut because domestic uranium production is carried out in these countries without major considerations for the cost of production , projections for  India  and Pakistan  are included in \nTable  1.23.  \nTable 1.23.

In 2017 , \nproduction was 85% of listed capability. From 2003 to 2015 , production varied between 90% and \n75% of listed production capability. From 2003 to 2011 , the expansion of production capability \nwas driven by increasing and what  were considered sustainable uranium prices. Production also \nincreased , although not as rapidly as the projected production capability. Since 2011 , and \ndespite a depressed uranium market , production continued to increase , mainly due to the start-\nup of the Cigar Lake mine in Canada, the continued expansion of production in Kazakhstan  and \nthe development of the Husab mine in Namibia . The fact that production increased during a \nperiod of depressed uranium market prices can be attributed to the long planning ti mes and \ninvestment required to establish new mines and bring new production to the market , as well as \nthe time it takes to respond to changing market conditions. Increasing global production since \n2011 was essentially a response to increased demand and ura nium market prices beginning \nalmost a decade earlier. However , producers have recently responded to the sustained uranium \nmarket downturn by delaying mine expansions , temporarily s huttering some operations \n(e.g. McArthur River and Cigar Lake , Canada) and s caling back production at others \n(e.g. Kazakhstan ), leading to declining global production since 2019. Turning stated production \ncapability into production takes significant amounts of time , expertise and investment. \nMoreover , uranium mining operations and  production plans can be confounded by unexpected \ngeopolitical events , legal issues , technical challenges and so -called “Black Swan” events , the \nmost recent being the COVID -19 pandemic and geopolitical tensions in eastern Europe.  \nProjections of production capability have increased somewhat compared to projections \nmade in the 2020 edition of this report , as mine development activity has continued in key \nproducing countries despite low market prices. Compared to the 2020 edition , category A -II and \nB-II projec tions for 2025 increased by 10% and decreased by 2% , respectively. Projections from \n2030 to 2040 in the A -II category increased by 4.5% in 2030, 3.7% in 2035 and 13.2% in 2040, \ncompared to projections made in the 2020 edition of this publication. Projections from 2025 to \n2040 in the B -II category have increased by 34% in 2030 , 25% in 2035 and 34% in 2040, compared \nto projections in the 2020 edition of this report. Compared to projections in earlier reports there \nare greater differences , which can be expecte d because of the continuous updating of plans and \nresponses to market conditions , along with the amount of time it can take to respond to these \nchanges.  \nAs currently projected , production capability of existing and committed production centres \n(category A -II) is projected to reach about 69 675 tU by 2025, then decline by 4% to 67 105 tU in \n2030, 18% to 55 095  tU in 2035 , and 10% to 49 475 tU in 2040, with an overall decline of 29% from \n2025 to 2040. The overall decrease of 29% in projected production capab ility from 2025 to 2040 \nreported in this edition reflects the general decline in local resources (RAR and IR) at existing \nand committed production centres.  \nTotal potential production capability , including planned and prospective production centres \n(categor y B-II), is projected to reach about 83 105 in 2025, then increase to 107 850 tU in 2030, \nbefore declining to 104 480 tU in 2035 and 98 250 tU in 2040. The current projection estimates for B -II category production capability indicate an overall increase of  18% from 2025 to 2040, \ncompared to a projected 10% decline over the same period reported in the 2020 edition of this report. This reflects the rate of mine development that has occurred in recent years despite the extended period of low uranium market pri ces continuing through mid -2021.  \nRecent committed mines and expansions  \nAs expected during a prolonged period of low market prices and , more recently , planned \nproduction cuts at existing facilities, there were limited new production plans unveiled during th is \nreporting period (Table 1.24). Since the first production from the Husab mine in Namibia  in 2016, \nno new major developments have been completed and some have been delayed. However , it is \nnow expected that by -product recovery of uranium from the Talvivaara deposit in Finland  will \nbegin in 2024. Kazakhstan remains committed to development of the Zhalpak deposit by ISL , but \neven though pilot production began in 2016, dates for completion and beginning production were \nnot provided. In Russia , construction of  the surface complex and infrastructure elements of new \nURANIUM SUPPLY  \n92 URANIUM 2022: RESOURCES, PRODUCTI ON AND DEMAND, NEA No. 7634, © OECD 2023  mine No. 6 at the Priargunsky production centre began in 2018. Completion , now scheduled for \n2025, will increase annual production capacity of this operation by 2  300 tU.  \nTable 1.24.

The main increases in the longer term are expected  to come from Australia , Botswana , Brazil , Canada, Kazakhstan , \nNamibia , Niger , Russia , Tanzania, Ukraine , the United  States  and Zambia . However , since few \nof these developments have a firm date for first production , most will not be developed  until \nuranium market prices increase and remain at levels justifying the investments required to increase production.  \nWith appropriate market signals, total annual production capacity could increase by as much \nas 75  000 tU by 2040 (Table 1.25). However , many of these increases in production capacity will \nonly go forward if there are lasting improvements in market conditions, as the costs of mining \nand development of new exploitation technologies have increased and there are risks producing in jurisdictions that have not previously hosted uranium mining.  \nWhile there is uncertainty surrounding the development of prospective and planned \nproduction centres , given the depressed market conditions of recent years , the number of \npotential capacity additions listed in Table 1.25 underscores the availability of uranium deposits \nof commercial interest. Since these sites span several stages of approvals , licensing and \nfeasibility assessments , it can reasonably be expected that at least some will take several years \nto be  brought into production and others may never be. Notwithstanding the time it takes to \nbring new deposits into production , these new mine developments are timely since long -\nstanding , significant production centres in Australia  (Ranger) and Niger  (Cominak) were closed \nin 2021, and the Rössing production centre in Namibia  is expected to end production in 2026 \n(three facilities with a combined production capacity of 7  900 tU/yr).    \n URANIUM SUPPLY  \nURANIUM 2022: RESOURCES, PRODUCTION AND DEMAND, NEA No. 7634, © OECD 2023  93 Table 1.25.

(a) Technical difficulties contributed to decisions to stop \nproduction. (b) Although  not fully satisfying the definition of an idled mine (no commercial production ), it is included here because it \nproduced 251 tU and 186 tU in 2012 and 2013 (respectively) as part of two pre -commercial pilot tests. A care and maintenance team \nregularly prov ides upkeep of the mine's infrastructure  so that it can be recommissioned and brought on stream when market conditions \nare more favourable.  \nAs shown in Table 1.26 , annual production capacity could be increased relatively rapidly if the \nlisted idled mines a re brought back into service. Although each mine operation is unique in terms \nof operational costs and a threshold price for reopening , the ability to raise capital as required to \nresume operation and to meet regulatory requirements , idled mines could be r eturned to \nproduction faster , given that all permits and licences remain in place. Decisions to resume \nproduction depend principally on increased market prices. With the right market signals, idled \nmine facilities, associated with a total of at least 335  000 tU in local resources (recoverable), could \npotentially bring as much as 29  000 tU annually to the market if all are brought back into \nproduction. At least some of these facilities can reasonably be expected to be brought back online \nbefore new mines are established , should uranium market conditions improve.  \n URANIUM SUPPLY  \nURANIUM 2022: RESOURCES, PRODUCTION AND DEMAND, NEA No. 7634, © OECD 2023  95 Operations to recover uranium from gold tailings in South  Africa  could also contribute to \nincreased global production relatively rapidly and production at Somaïr (Niger ) could be returned \nto full capacity (capacity was reduced by 30% in 2017 due to poor market conditions) with the right \nmarket signals. Moreover , operations that have progressed to pilot mining , such as Trekkopje \n(Namibia ), or those that have operating permits but where work to bring  the site into production \nwas suspended pending more favourable market conditions, such as Imouraren ( Niger ), could also \nincrease global annual production by over 7  500 tU. Improved market conditions and significant \ninvestment , however , would be required t o bring operations like these on stream (note that \nTrekkopje is included in the list of idled mines, while Imouraren is listed in Table 1.25 “Planned \nand prospective mines”; see Table 1.26 footnotes for additional details).  \nSufficient uranium resources hav e been identified to support even the most aggressive \nscenarios of growth in nuclear generating capacity. However , the majority of this in -ground \nuranium cannot be brought to the market without improved market conditions. At the market prices of early 2021  (that is , up to the ending date that this edition covers , 1 January 2021) , less \nthan 25% of the recoverable resource base outlined in this edition could be economically brought \ninto production , since resources with estimated mining costs greater than 80  USD/kgU \n(USD  30.80/lb  U\n3O8) cannot be profitably mined at such prices. However , in the latter half of and \ncontinuing into 2022 , uranium market prices have streng thened significantly (up to \nUSD  64.50/lb  U3O8 in mid -April of 2022) owing to speculation and heightened uncertainties \nassociated with ongoing geopolitical conflict. Should such market prices be sustained , planned \nproduction cutbacks could be eased , idled mines could be brought back on stream and new \nmines could be developed.  \nIt should also be noted that there is the ability to increase production more rapidly than the \ntraditional lengthy mine development processes of the recent past. However , efforts to manage \nthe COVID -19 pandemic at production facilities and market realignme nts resulting from \ngeopolitical tensions could lead to further , unplanned reductions in production as well as \nrestrictions to the flow of nuclear materials (including uranium) in the global marketplace , \nwhich would test the market’s ability to continue providing an adequate supply of uranium to the global nuclear fuel supply chain.   \nConclusions  \nNearly 8  000 000 tonnes of in -ground uranium resources of economic interest (recoverable at \n<USD  260/kgU) have been identified in this edition. However , much of this in -ground uranium \ncannot be brought into production without improved market conditions. Poor market conditions \nhave also slowed investment in uranium exploration , which could affect delineation of additional \nlow-cost reasonably assured and inf erred resources in the longer term.  \nAt the market prices of early 2021 (the end of the reporting period for this edition of the Red \nBook) of about USD 30/lb U 3O8 (USD 78/kg U) , only 25% of the recoverable resource base outlined \nin this edition of the Red B ook could be economically brought into production , since resources \nwith estimated mining costs greater than 80 USD/kgU cannot be profitably mined at these prices. \nTo help ensure that uranium resources are brought to market when they are needed , future \nsupplies would benefit from timely research and innovation efforts to further improve uranium exploration and to develop new , more cost -effective extraction techniques.  \nHowever , since some producers have either idled production facilities or reduced production  \ndue to a lengthy period of low uranium prices, there is an ability to increase production more \nrapidly than the traditional lengthy mine development processes of the recent past. Beyond idled \nprojects, significant investment and time could be required to bring existing uranium resources \ninto production , particularly for high -cost, undiscovered or unconventional resources. Historically , \nsignificant proportions of identified resources have never been extracted , while , on average , the \nextraction of identified  resources has taken one to two decades or more (see , for example , IAEA \n2020, Figure 2.75) , in addition to several decades for the delineation of undiscovered resources.  \n  \nURANIUM SUPPLY  \n96 URANIUM 2022: RESOURCES, PRODUCTI ON AND DEMAND, NEA No. 7634, © OECD 2023  Looking ahead , with the easing of efforts to control the COVID -19 pandemic at produc tion \nfacilities, and the recent run- up in the spot price of uranium in the latter half of 2021 , a modest \nincrease in the production of uranium can be expected. However , with ongoing geopolitical \ntensions that threaten the continuation of some aspects of global trade in nuclear materials, the \nmarket's ability to continue supplying an adequate amount of uranium to the global nuclear fuel \nsupply chain will be tested.  \nReferences  \nAbate , T.

Uranium demand and supply/demand relationship \nThis chapter summarises the current status  and projected growth in world nuclear electricity \ngenerating capacity and commercial reactor- related uranium requirements up to 2040. Relationships \nbetween uranium supply and demand are analysed and important developments related to the \nworld uranium mark et are described.  \nNuclear generating capacity and reactor -related uranium requirements  \nOn 1  January 2021, a total of 442  commercial nuclear reactors were operational in the world, in \n31 countries, and 52  reactors were under construction.  \nDuring 2019 and 2020, 11 reactors were connected to the grid , construction started on \n8 reactors and 14 reactors were permanently shut down. Table  2.1 summarise s the status of the \nworld’s nuclear power plants as of 1  January 2021. The global nuclear power plant fleet genera ted \na total of about 2  626 TWh of electricity in 2019 and about 2  523 TWh in 2020 (see Table 2.2).  \nWorld annual uranium requirements amounted to around 60 100 tU as of 1  January 2021.  \nGlobal nuclear programmes  \nOECD  \nAs of 1  January 2021, 293 reactors were operational in 19 OECD countries and constituted about \n71% of the world’s nuclear electricity generating capacity. During 2019 and 2020, a total of 16 reactors were under construction in OECD countries with two additional construction starts in \nTürkiye and the United Kingdom. In this same period, 12 reactors were permanently shut down in France, Japan, Korea, Sweden, Switzerland and the United States. A number of OECD member \ncountries, namely the Czech Republic, France, Finland, Hungary, the Slovak Republi c and the \nUnited Kingdom, remain committed to maintaining or increasing nuclear generating capacity in \ntheir energy mix. To help enable the development of small and advanced reactors, several \ncountries have set out frameworks designed to encourage the indu stry to bring technically and \ncommercially viable small reactor propositions to the global marketplace.  \nThe OECD reactor -related uranium requirements amounted to around 40 000 tU as of 1  January  2021.  \n  \nURANIUM DEMAND AND SUPPLY/DEMAND RELATIONSHIP  \n100 URANIUM 2022: RESOURCES, PRODUCTI ON AND DEMAND, NEA No. 7634, © OECD 2023  Table 2.1.

World uranium requirements : 60 114 tU  \n(as of 1 January 2021)  \n \nEuropean Union  \nIn 2018, the European Commission established a Technical Experts Group on Sustainable Finance \n(TEG) to assist in the development of a unified classification system for sustainable economic \nactivities (i.e.  the EU Taxonomy), along with methodologies for low -carbon indices and metrics \nfor climate -related disclosure. The EU taxonom y Regulation (EU) 2020/852 esta blishes uniform \ncriteria for determining the degree of environmental sustainability of investments . On 9 March \n2022 the European Commission (EC) adopted Delegated Regulation (EU) 2022/1214, which \nincludes criteria for classifying nuclear energy as a n environmentally sustainable  investment \nand recogni ses that nuclear  energy can contribute to the decarbonisation of the Europea n \nUnion’s economy . \nIn Belgium , seven nuclear power plants provided about 40% of domestic electricity generation in \n2020. Under current Belgian law, nuclear power is to be phased out by 2025. The Belgian \nConstitutional Court ruled in March 2020 that a law passed in 2015 to grant a ten- year extension \nto Doel units 1 and 2 was unconstitutional because a required Environmental I mpact Assessment \nwas never produced before granting extended operations. However, the Court said it would allow the law to remain in force until the end of 2022.  The corresponding environmental impact \nassessment and the public consultation were performed, and a new law granting a ten- year \nextension to Doel units 1 and 2 was passed in 2022.  In addition, the government plans to dedicate \nEUR 100 million over four years to investigate the potential to build new small modular reactors \n(SMRs).  \nIn Bulgaria , follow ing the closure of four older reactors by the end of 2006, only two units \n(about 0.95  GWe net each) remain operational at the Kozloduy Nuclear Power Plant and provided \naround 40% of domestic electricity production in 2020. To compensate for the loss of nuc lear \ngenerating capacity and to regain its position as a regional electricity exporter without \nincreasing carbon emissions, the government plans to build new reactors. A nuclear station at Belene was originally planned in the 1980s, but was stopped in the early 1990s due to \nenvironmental and financial concerns. In May  2019, the government advertised for a strategic \ninvestor to participate in the Belene project to build two new reactors.

In May 2015, the Czech government announced a national energy pol icy that \nfavours an ambitious increase in nuclear power to about 50 -55% by 2050 as a means to reduce \ncarbon emissions. The Czech utility ČEZ applied to the State Office of Nuclear Safety to construct \ntwo new reactors at its Dukovany site. Under the current  schedule, the reactor supplier is to be \nselected by the end of 2022, with commissioning expected by 2036. The Czech government \nwould loan 70% of the cost of building a single 1  200 MWe unit, with Č EZ funding the remaining \n30%. In June 2020, Č EZ stated that it expects to invest about USD  2.3 billion over the next three \ndecades to extend the operating lifetime of the four reactors at Dukovany by a further 20 years \nto a total of 60 years.  \nIn Finland , four units (two each at the Olkiluoto and Loviisa Nuclea r Power Plants) with a \ntotal generating capacity of 2.8  GWe were operational on 1  January 2021, providing about 34% of \ndomestic electricity generation in 2020. Teollisuuden Voima Oyj (TVO) owns and operates the \ntwo plant units, Olkiluoto 1 and 2, and it ha s deployed a third unit, Olkiluoto 3 (OL3), an \nEvolutionary Power Reactor (EPR) with capacity of 1.6 GWe. The OL3 construction has suffered \nnumerous delays and cost overruns. TVO was granted an operating licence in 2019 and in April \n2020 applied for permis sion to load fuel. OL3 was connected to the grid in March 2022. The \nproject for the new nuclear site in Pyhäjoki to build a new VVER reactor provided by a \nconsortium with Rosatom was cancelled in 2022. There is political support in Finland to consider \nnew SMR builds in the future.  \nIn France , 56 operational reactors generated 70% of domestically produced electricity in 2020. \nConstruction of a new EPR at the Flamanville Nuclear Power Plant began in late 2007. Repairs to \nwelds in the Flamanville 3 EPR were co mpleted and deemed compliant by the French Nuclear \nSafety Authority (ASN). Fuel loading is now scheduled to start in early 2023 following start -up tests \nand authorisation from the ASN. In February 2020, unit 1 at Fessenheim was closed, followed by \nthe closure of unit 2 in June 2020. The closure of the Fessenheim reactors was part of the energy policy objective to reduce the share of nuclear power to 50% by 2035. However, in late 2021, \nÉlectricité de France (EDF) proposed the construction of six EPR -2 units and the French president \nstated that France would pursue the construction of new reactors to maintain its energy security \nand to meet climate goals.  \nIn Germany , six reactors were operational on 1  January 2021, producing about 11% of domestic \nelectricity generation in 2020. Following the Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Power Plant accident, the German Cabinet announced that it was accelerating the nuclear phase -out by permanently \nshutting down the reactors. The remaining reactors are to be permanently shut down no  later \nthan the end of 2022 in the following order: Grohnde, Gundremmingen  C and Brokdorf by the end \nof 2021, and the three most recently built facilities –  Isar 2, Emsland and Neckarwestheim –  by the \nend of 2022. In November 2022, however, the German parl iament voted that Germ any’s three \nremaining nuclear power reactors still operating in 2022 should  keep operating until mid -April \n2023 to ensure the security of electricity supply. With reduced nuclear generating capacity, \nrenewable energy sources are being added at a rapid rate, but it has also been necessary to \nincrease the use of coal- fired plants, which in turn increases greenhouse gas emissions. In \naddition, coal power plants are planned to remain part of the generation mix until 2038. The \nFederal Minis try for Economic Affairs and Energy presented its new project funding programme \nin the field of safety research for nuclear facilities for the years 2021 to 2025 with a budget of approximately EUR  38 million per year. The objective of the research and deve lopment is to \nimprove the safety of nuclear facilities and to establish and further develop the scientific basis for the safe management of radioactive waste. These objectives will continue to remain relevant after \nGermany’ s decision to phase out the comme rcial use of nuclear energy.  \n  \nURANIUM DEMAND AND SUPPLY/DEMAND RELATIONSHIP  \n104 URANIUM 2022: RESOURCES, PRODUCTI ON AND DEMAND, NEA No. 7634, © OECD 2023  In Hungary , four operational VVER reactors at the Paks Nuclear Power Plant (1.9  GWe net \ncapacity) accounted for 48% of electricity generation at the end of 2020. In January 2020, the \ngovernment approved the new National Ener gy Strategy 2030 and the National Energy and \nClimate Plans 2030. The preservation of nuclear generation capacity by replacing existing units \nat the Paks Nuclear Power Plant nearing the end of their lifetime is one of the key strategic \nmeasures for further decarbonisation of the electricity sector. Plans are well advanced for the \nconstruction of two new VVER -1200 reactors at the Paks site. Preliminary work began in June \n2019 and the construction phase is expected to start in 2022 -2023. The units were origina lly \nscheduled to start operating  in 2025 or 2026. All of Hungar y’s nuclear fuel supply is contracted \nfrom TVEL in Russia. The construction licence application for the two nuclear power units is currently under review by the Hungarian Atomic Energy Authorit y. \nWith no nuclear generating capacity, Lithuania relies heavily on imports, in particular natural \ngas from Russia. Prospects for a new nuclear plant diminished  following the election of a new \ncoalition government in 2012, led by a party that had opposed t he construction of the proposed \nVisaginas Nuclear Power Plant on economic grounds. In 2016, the government released its national energy strategy and announced a delay of the nuclear project until more favourable market and economic conditions arise. The Visaginas Nuclear Power Plant was planned to be built by GE-Hitachi, but has not proceeded. In April 2022, Lithuania’ s government stated the country was \n“seeking full energy independence from Russian gas”.  \nIn the Netherlands , the single operational reactor (0.5  GWe of net capacity) supplied 3% of \ndomestically generated electricity in 2020. There are currently no plans for conventional large new \nnuclear build in the Netherlands. Nevertheless, it is stated in the National Climate Agreement that \nnuclear power is one of the options for the future energy mix. The government of the Netherlands \nplans to spend EUR  35 billion by  2030 to reach new climate targets, which aim at a 50% cut in \nemissions compared to 1990 levels, and include EUR  500 million in support for two new SMRs.  \nIn Poland , which as of 2021 has no nuclear generating capacity, coal -fired plants generate \nmore than 90% of domestic electricity. Poland had four 440 MWe Russian VVER -440 units under \nconstruction in the 1980s at Zarnowiec, but these were cancell ed in 1990. The government \ncontinues to advance plans to construct about 6  GWe of new nuclear power generation in the next \n20 years. The legal framework for the development of nuclear power was established in 2011 and \nthe Council of Ministers instructed th e Ministry of Economy to prepare a new national strategy \nconcerning radioactive waste and spent fuel management. In 2021, the government recommitted \nto launching a nuclear programme with the release of a draft consultation that targets start of construction on the first of four to six reactors by 2033.  \nIn Romania, two CANDU reactors at the Cernavoda Nuclear Power Plant provided around 20% \nof the electricity generated in the country in 2020. Nuclearelectrica, the state- owned utility that \noperates the Cernav oda Nuclear Power Plant, has also announced plans to refurbish unit  1 of the \nplant by 2028 in order to extend the operational lifetime for another 30 years. The project to complete Cernavoda units 3 and 4 is now also proceeding and Nuclearelectrica has est imated that \nunit 3 will start commercial operation in 2030, followed by unit 4 in 2031. In October 2020, an \nintergovernmental agreement was signed with the United States by which the United States \nintends to support the construction of two new Cernavoda re actors and help refurbish unit 1. In \nMarch 2019, a Memorandum of Understanding was signed with NuScale Power to evaluate the \npotential for SMRs in Romania. In November  2021, Romania announced the potential roll -out of \nSMRs in the country by 2028.  \nIn the S lovak Republic , a total of four reactors with a combined capacity of 1.8  GWe net were \noperational as of 1  January 2021 and provided around 53% of the country’s electricity in 2020. \nConstruction of two additional units at the Mochovce Nuclear Power Plant ha s been delayed as \na result of design safety improvements and technology updates and is still ongoing. Mochovce 3 completed hot testing in April 2019, and the draft permit of the Nuclear Regulatory Authority for fuel loading was released in 2020. When in op eration, the new units will add 0.9  GWe of \nelectrical generating capacity to the grid.  \n  \nURANIUM DEMAND AND SUPPLY/DEMAND RELATIONSHIP  \nURANIUM 2022: RESOURCES, PRODUCTION AND DEMAND, NEA No. 7634, © OECD 2023  105 In Slovenia , the single nuclear reactor in operation (Krško, with 0.70  GWe capacity) is jointly \nowned and operated with Croatia by Nuklearna Elektrana Krško (NEK) . The Krško reactor began \ncommercial operation in 1983 and was recently granted a 20 -year lifetime extension to 2043. The \nsingle unit accounted for about 38% of the electricity generated in Slovenia in 2020, although a \nproportion of this is exported to mee t about 15 -20% of Croatia ’s electricity requirements. An \nambitious programme of safety upgrades at the Krško plant was rolled out after the Fukushima Daiichi accident, and was completed in 2021. The government of Slovenia will make a decision by 2027 on wh ether to build a second unit at the Krško Nuclear Power Plant site.  \nIn Spain , seven operational nuclear reactors with a total generating capacity of 7.1 GWe \nprovided 22% of total domestically generated electricity in 2020. The government approved in March  2021 the national energy and climate plan, which includes the phasing out of nuclear \nenergy by 2035. In May 2020, the Spanish Nuclear Safety Council  granted permission for \nAlmaraz  1 and 2 to operate until 2027 and 2028, respectively. In addition, Vandelló s 2 applied \nfor a licence extension to 2030. In May 2020, the State Company for Radioactive Waste and \nDecommissioning, Enresa, applied for the phase 1 dismantling authorisation of the Santa Maria \nde Garoña Nuclear Power Plant . \nIn Sweden , six operational re actors (with 6.6  GWe net capacity) generated about 30% of \ndomestic electricity supply in 2020. At the end of 2019, Ri nghals 2 was shut down after 44  years of \noperation and the Ringhals 1 reactor finally ceased operations on 31 December 2020. In June 2019, \nthe Swedish Radiation Safety Authority approved Forsmark  1 and 2 to operate for a further ten \nyears, until 2028. For the remaining reactors, plans remain to continue operation for up to 60  years.  \nNorth America  \nIn Canada, 19 operating reactors p rovided about 15% of the county’ s electricity needs in 2020 and \nshould continue to play an important role in the future. The province of Ontario has 18 of those \noperating nuclear power reactors across three power plants: Pic kering, Darlington and Bruce. \nA CAD  26 b illion refurbishment plan for Ontario’ s nuclear reactors will see the sequential \nrefurbishment of four units at the Darlington site and six units at the Bruce site. The refurbishment of the Darlington Nuclear Generating Station began with work on the first  reactor \nin 2016 and is expected to be completed by 2026. The Bruce project started with unit 6 in early \n2020 and will be completed by 2033. Ontario ’s third operating nuclear power plant, Pickering, was \noriginally scheduled to shut down in 2020, but the Ca nadian Nuclear Safety Commission (CNSC) \nextended the plant ’s licence to at least 2026. The federal government and other partners have \nadvanced efforts in priority areas, such as developing SMR research and development and exploring business partnerships for potential deployment in the late 2020s. The CNSC continues \nto work to ensure readiness so as to regulate SMRs in Canada. As of June 2021, 12 SMR technology \ncompanies applied to the CNSC for the Pre -Licensing Vendor Design Review process.  \nIn Mexico , the two units at the Laguna Verde Nuclear Power Plant (a total of 1.6  GWe net \ncapacity) provided about 5% of the electricity generated in the country in 2020. Laguna Verde units received permission from the national regulator to operate at the extended power u prate \nlevel (120%). In July 2020 Mexico ’s nuclear regulator approved a 30 -year extension to the \noperating licence of Laguna Verde 1, allowing it to operate until July 2050, and a similar application for a lifetime extension was submitted for unit 2 in 2020 .  \nIn the United States , 94 reactors were operational as of 1  January 2021, contributing 19.7% of \nthe total electricity generated in the country in 2020. Two AP1000 reactors are currently under \nconstruction at the Vogtle power plant in the state of Georgia . In April 2020, Indian Point  2 was \nshut down four years before the expiry of its operating licence, and Duane Arnold -1 (601 MWe) \nwas shut down in October 2020. A total of 6.8 GWe of nuclear capacity in eight states has thus closed before the end of the li censed operating period between 2013 and 2021. However, states \nand utilities are acting in support of nuclear power. For example, the New Jersey Board of Public \nUtilities voted in 2021 to extend zero emissions credits for nuclear power plants and the Illin ois \nstate legislature passed a law that includes about USD  700 million in subsidies over five years to \nkeep the Byron, Dresden and Braidwood nuclear power plants in operation. The US Nuclear \nRegulatory Commission first approved and then reversed a 20 -year licence extension for Turkey \nURANIUM DEMAND AND SUPPLY/DEMAND RELATIONSHIP  \n106 URANIUM 2022: RESOURCES, PRODUCTI ON AND DEMAND, NEA No. 7634, © OECD 2023  Point 3 and 4, authorising the reactors to operate for a total of up to 80 years. On the industry side, \nTerraPower recently announced plans to build its Natrium reactor at a retiring coal plant in \nWyoming, which currently receives almost 90% of its electricity generation from fossil fuels.  The \nUS Department of E nergy is investing nearly USD  2 billion to support the licensing, construction \nand demonstration of this first -of-a-kind reactor by 2028. In July 2020, the US International \nDevelopment Finance Corporation lifted its legacy prohibition on funding nuclear energy projects \noverseas.  \nEast Asia  \nProspects for nuclear growth are greater in East Asia than in any other region of the world, \nprincipally driven by rapid growth of nuclear capacity in China. Recent changes in the official \nenergy s trategy of Japan and Korea have put national reliance on domestic nuclear energy back in \nthe main scene.  \nIn China , 50 operational reactors with a total installed capacity of around 47.5 GWe provided \nabout 5% of national electricity production in 2020. Rec ent developments include the grid \nconnection in June 2019 of Taishan 2, the second EPR to start operation. In November 2019, \nChina ’s first commercial nuclear heating project began operating at the Haiyang Nuclear Power \nPlant with two AP1000 units. In 2020,  hot testing was completed at the Fuqing  5, one of the first \nHualong One domestic design reactors under construction in China. A total of 1 3 reactors were \nunder construction as of 1  January 2021. In the period 2019 to 2021, 7 new reactors totalling \ncapacit y of 7.6 GWe were connected to the grid. Projected nuclear growth remains strong in \nChina and the country is moving ahead with the planning and construction of new nuclear \npower plants and the development of its own Gen  III technologies. The government pla ns to \nadd significant nuclear generating capacity in order to meet rising energy demand and limit \ngreenhouse gases and other atmospheric emissions since poor air quality, mainly due to \nemissions from coal -fired plants, is a significant health issue. As China aims to increase its \ninstalled nuclear capacity, it is also aiming at becoming self -sufficient in the nuclear fuel supply \nand fuel cycle aspects and has initiated a number of domestic projects, often in co- operation \nwith foreign suppliers, to meet these  goals.  \nIn Japan, nuclear energy in 2020 provided only around 5% of domestic electricity generation \n(from over 30% before 2011). With most of Japan’s 33 nuclear power plants out of service, Japanese \nutilities have been importing large amounts of oil and n atural gas for electricity generation, driving \nelectricity prices and greenhouse emissions upward. Reactor restarts and rejuvenation of the industry is, however, proving to be challenging given the stringent new regulatory requirements and public resistanc e. Nevertheless, the finalisation in 2015 of a new long -term energy policy that \nenvisions nuclear power representing 20 -22% of total energy supply in 2030 represented an \nimportant step for a sustained nuclear comeback. Sendai 1 and 2 were the first reactor s to restart \nin 2015, and a further eight have restarted since then. Mihama 3 reactor, which had been idle since 2011, was restarted in June 2021. However, in October 2021 the utility took the reactor offline to \nimplement antiterrorism measures, a requirement of new regulations introduced by the Nuclear \nRegulation Authority. Mihama 3 had been granted a licence extension in 2016 to operate beyond 40 years. As of 2022, 16 reactors were in the process of restart approval. Reactors that have \nrestarted are also required to construct bunkered backup control centres within five years of \nregulatory approval to restart.  \nIn Korea , 24 operational reactors produced around 30% of the total electricity generated \nin 2020. Construction of four reactors (5.4 GWe additional c apacity) is underway. Shin -Hanul \nunit 1 was connected to the grid in mid -2022. On the other side, Kori units 2 and 3 will be \npermanently shut down by the end of 2024. An energy transition policy was announced in \nOctober 2017, outlining a long- term phasing out of nuclear power. However, the newly elected \ngovernment in 2022 has since changed this policy and set instead a target for nuclear energy to \nprovide a minimum of 30% of electricity in 2030 and 35% by 2036.  \nAlthough Mongolia  does not currently have nucl ear generating capacity, it has signalled an \ninterest in the use of small and medium- sized reactors.  \nURANIUM DEMAND AND SUPPLY/DEMAND RELATIONSHIP  \nURANIUM 2022: RESOURCES, PRODUCTION AND DEMAND, NEA No. 7634, © OECD 2023  107 Europe (non -EU)  \nThis region is undergoing strong growth with reactors under construction. Several countries in \nthis region continue to support nuclear pow er and overall growth in nuclear generating capacity \nis expected.  \nIn Armenia , the single operational reactor (Metsamor  2, with 0.4 GWe capacity) provided \nabout 34% of the electricity generated in the country in 2020. In 2015, the nuclear power plant \nbegan a large -scale life extension maintenance program me with the help of Rosatom. In October \n2021 ANRA, the regulator, extended the operating licence to 2026. According to the Armenian \nenergy sector development plan, construction of one new unit is envisaged by  2027.  \nIn Belarus,  a USD  10 billion agreement financed by Russia was signed with Rosatom’s \nAtomstroyexport in 2012 to build the country ’s first nuclear power plant. It consists of two \nVVER -1200 reactors, with unit 1 connected to the grid in November 2020 and unit 2 still under \nconstruction as of 2022.  \nIn Russia , 38 operational reactors (with 28.6  GWe net capacity) provided about 21% of the \ntotal electricity generated in the country in 2020. Russia has brought 10 reactors online in the \nperiod 2011- 2021, in cluding the two Akademik Lomonosov floating nuclear power plants. \nRosatom has confirmed its intention to commission two other floating nuclear power plants  by \n2027. In April 2020, the Russian nuclear regulator extended the operating licence of the \nBeloyars k BN -600 fast reactor by five years to 2025. As of 1 January 2021, three reactors were \nunder construction in Russia. In 2021, Rosatom was granted a construction licence for the \nBREST -OD-300 reactor, a lead -cooled fast reactor. The reactor is due to start o perating in 2026 \nand is part of a pilot demonstration programme aimed at closing the nuclear fuel cycle. The \nprogramme also includes the design and construction of reference SMR power units. In addition to an active domestic programme, the state -run energy  company Rosatom is currently involved \nin new reactor projects in several countries (e.g.  Bangladesh, Belarus, China, Hungary, India, \nIran, Türkiye and Uzbekistan).  \nIn Switzerland , four operating reactors produced 33% of the electricity generated in the \ncountry in 2020. Switzerland’ s first nuclear power plant, Mühleberg, with an approximate \noutput power of 373  MW, was permanently shut down on 20 December 2019. In 2017, a public \nreferendum was organised on the new Energy Strategy 2050. Under the new law, no  permits for \nthe construction of new nuclear power plants or any basic changes to existing nuclear power \nplants will be delivered. The existing nuclear power plants may remain in operation for as long \nas they are declared safe by the Federal Nuclear Safety  Inspectorate.  \nIn Türkiye , the government continues to advance its nuclear development programme as its \neconomy faces rapidly escalating electricity demand. Construction of the countr y’s first nuclear \npower reactor, the first of four VVER -1200 units at Ak kuyu, started in April 2018. A  construction \nlicence for unit 2 was issued in September 2019. Construction of the second and third reactor units at the Akkuyu began in 2020 and 2021, respectively. In 2021, preparations began for the \nconstruction of the four th unit. In March 2021, Akkuyu Nuclear, a subsidiary of Russi a’s Rosatom, \nreceived two loans from Sovcombank to finance the construction of the Akkuyu Nuclear Power \nPlant. The first unit is expected to be in operation by 2023.  \nIn Ukraine , 15 reactors with a combined net installed capacity of 13.1  GWe were operational \non 1  January 2021, producing 51% of the electricity generated in the country in 2020. The \nnational energy programme foresees that nuclear energy will continue to generate about 50% \nof total ele ctricity production by 2035. In February 2022, Russia launched a military offensive \nagainst Ukraine. In early March 2022 the Zaporizhzhia plant in south -eastern  Ukraine became \nthe first operating civil nuclear power plant to come under armed attack. Ukrain e had been \nreceiving most of its nuclear services and nuclear fuel from Russia. In June 2022 an agreement \nwas signed with Westinghouse that will see the company provide all fuel for the Ukrainian \nreactors.  \nIn the United Kingdom , 15 operational reactors wit h a combined capacity of 8.9  GWe net as of \n1 January 2021 provided 14.5% of total domestic electricity generation in 2020. In the coming \ndecades, the current UK fleet will be shut down, with the first units expected to come offline in \nURANIUM DEMAND AND SUPPLY/DEMAND RELATIONSHIP  \n108 URANIUM 2022: RESOURCES, PRODUCTI ON AND DEMAND, NEA No. 7634, © OECD 2023  2023 and the last cur rently expected to close by 2035. The government has taken a series of actions \nto encourage nuclear new build. EDF, China General Nuclear Power Group (CGN) and the \ndevelopment vehicle NNB Generation Company HPC Limited are constructing two EPRs at Hinkley \nPoint C (3.2 GWe). In January 2021, the United Kingdom also entered negotiations with EDF in \nrelation to the Sizewell C project in Suffolk. In December 2020, the United Kingdom published the \nresponse to the consultation on a regulated asset base (RAB) mode l for private investment in new \nnuclear generation. Having assessed the consultation responses, the UK government believes that \na RAB model remains credible for large -scale nuclear projects. The UK government is thus \ncontinuing to explore a RAB model with developers. On the other side, the United Kingdom’s \nadvanced gas -cooled reactor (AGR) nuclear power stations have been scheduled to progressively \nreach the end of their operational timespans by 2030. The two -unit Dungeness B was shut down \nin June 2021, whi le Hunterson B -1 in Scotland ceased operations in November 2021. The \ngovernment is investing more than GBP 100 million of innovation and industrial strategy funding into advanced nuclear research and development to help the development of SMRs and advanced  \nmodular reactors (AMRs) in the United Kingdom.  \nMiddle East, Central and Southern Asia  \nNuclear generating capacity in this region is expected  to grow in coming years as governments \ncontinue to implement plans to meet rising electricity demand without increasing greenhouse gas emissions.  \nIn Bangladesh, a deal with Rosatom was ratified in 2012 to build two reactors at the Rooppur \nsite. Under the terms of the agreement, Russia will reportedly provide support for construction \nand infrastructure development, supply fuel for the entire lifetime of the reactors and take back \nspent fuel. The first safety -related concrete for unit 1 was poured in 2017, w ith the p our for unit  2 \nin 2018. The Bangladesh Atomic Energy Commission planned to commission the two VVER -1200 \nin 2023 and 2024, respectively. However, it is still not clear to what extent COVID -19 may have \nslowed the work.  \nIn India , 22 reactors (with 6 .2 GWe net capacity) were operational on 1  January 2021, providing \nabout 3.3% of domestic electricity generation in 2020. Agreements in 2008 that granted India the \nability to import uranium and nuclear technology have resulted in improved reactor performance. \nHowever, concerns about nuclear liability legislation have slowed the development of agreements on imported technology. In 2021, construction of seven new reactors was in progress, with four \nindigenous pressurised heavy water reactors (PHWRs), two VVER s and one sodium fast reactor. \nAs other countries with PHWR fleets have done, India has started the process of refurbishing its \nreactors to allow for extended operation. The national plan is to increase installed nuclear capacity \nto 15.7 GWe by 2031, follo wing the 2019 announcement of India’ s Department of Atomic Energy. \nIn 2021, Kakrapar -3 was connected to the grid.  \nIn the  Islamic Republic of Iran , one operational 900 MW reactor (Bushehr -1) supplied by \nAtomstroyexport provided 1.7% of domestic electricity  production in 2020. Another reactor, \nBushehr -2, also of Russian design, has been under construction since 2017. The second reactor \nis expected to start up in 2024. The government plans to develop up to 8 GWe of net installed \nnuclear capacity by 2030 in or der to reduce its reliance on fossil fuels. The country also has a \nmajor programme of uranium enrichment.  \nIn Pakistan, five reactors (with 1.3  GWe net capacity) were operational on 1  January 2021, \nsupplying about 7% of domestic electricity production in 2 020. On 1 January 2021 two reactors \nwere under construction in Pakistan but they have since been connected to the grid, in 2021 and \n2022, respectively. As part of an effort to address chronic power shortages, a growing population and increasing electricity  demand, the government established the Energy Security Action Plan \nwith a target of installing additional nuclear generating capacity by 2030. The Pakistan Atomic \nEnergy Commission signed a contract with China (CNNC) in 2017 for a Hualong One reactor, the  \ncountry’s third of the kind after two units were installed at Karachi. China’ s Import and Export \nBank is expected to provide the major part of the financing for the unit, Chashma- 5. \nURANIUM DEMAND AND SUPPLY/DEMAND RELATIONSHIP  \nURANIUM 2022: RESOURCES, PRODUCTION AND DEMAND, NEA No. 7634, © OECD 2023  109 In the United Arab Emirates , one unit of 1.3 GWe provided around 1% of th e domestic \nelectricity production in 2020. In late 2009, ENEC (the Emirates Nuclear Energy Corporation) \nannounced that it had selected a bid from a Korean KEPCO -led consortium to build four APR1400 \nreactors, to be built at the Barakah site. As of 1 January 2021, three pressurised water reactors \n(PWRs) were under construction at the Barakah Nuclear Power Plant and two of them (Barakah- 2 \nand Barakah- 3) have since connected to the grid, in 2021 and 2022 respectively. The last unit, \nBarakah- 4 started constructi on in 2015 and in 2022 was in the final stages of commissioning prior \nto construction completion.  \nOther countries in the region, currently without nuclear power plants, have been \nconsidering the development of such facilities.  \nJordan  currently has no nuc lear generating capacity. A plan to construct two reactors to \ngenerate electricity and desalinate water, and to develop the countr y’s uranium resources, had \nbeen moving forward, driven by rising energy demand and the need to reduce energy imports, \nwhich me et around 95% of national needs. However, the project to build these two VVER reactors \nhas since been cancelled and the country is now considering SMRs instead. It signed in 2018 several co -operation agreements with CNNC, Rolls- Royce, NuScale, X -energy and  Rosatom.  \nKazakhstan  continued to be the world’s largest uranium producer in 2021, but the country \nhas no active nuclear power generation capacity. In May 2014, Russia and Kazakhstan signed a \npreliminary co -operation agreement regarding the construction of  a new nuclear power plant \nwith generating capacity of between 300 and 1 200 MWe. Discussions on building a nuclear \npower plant in Kazakhstan are still pending.  \nSaudi Arabia  is seeking to build its first nuclear power plant and has solicited information \nfrom various vendors from China, France, Korea, Russia and the United States. In January 2021, \nthe energy minister said that the country is committed to becoming carbon neutra l and that it \naimed to produce 50% of its electricity from renewables by 2030, with the remaining 50% \nsupplied by natural gas.  \nIn Uzbekistan , the world’s fifth uranium producer as of 2021, the Uzbek Agency for the \nDevelopment of Nuclear Energy (UzAtom) and  Russia ’s Rosatom are working on finalising an \nEngineering, Procurement, Construction (EPC) contract for Uzbekista n’s first two commercial \nreactors. In 2020, a 10- year plan for Uzbekistan’s electricity sector was developed with the Asian \nDevelopment Bank and the World Bank. It aims to develop up to 30 GW of additional power \ncapacity by 2030, including 5 GW of solar power, 3.8 GW of hydro energy, 2.4  GW of nuclear energy, \nand up to 3 GW of wind power. In May 2020 the country’s Ministry of Energy published a report \non its strategy for electricity generation through 2030, which forecasts 15% of the countr y’s \nelectricity coming from nuclear energy by 2030, with 8% from solar and 7% from wind.  \nCentral and South America  \nGovernments in Argentina and Brazil continu e to support nuclear power, suggesting some \ngrowth in nuclear generating capacity in the long term, despite other countries in the region \nreportedly turning away from nuclear following the Fukushima Daiichi accident.  \nIn Argentina , three reactors were opera tional on 1  January 2021, accounting for 7% of \ndomestic electricity production in 2020. The Embalse reactor returned to service in 2020 \nfollowing a three -year upgrade and refurbishment programme that will allow it to operate for a \nfurther 30  years. In addi tion to providing electricity, Embalse can now also produce Cobalt -60 \nfor medical and industrial applications. In April 2020 a 20 -year lifetime extension project for \nAtucha 1, which currently has a licence to operate until 2024, was resumed. Work continues  on \nthe Carem -25 small modular reactor (SMR) at the site adjacent to the Atucha Nuclear Power \nPlant. In July 2021, a contract was signed between Nucleoelectrica (NA -SA) Argentina and the \ncountr y’s National Atomic Energy Commission to complete construction of the Carem -25 within \nthree years. There are plans to build other larger units by 2032, potentially of Chinese design. In \nAugust 2021 NA -SA was reported to be considering a Canadian project for a CANDU reactor at a \nstill-undecided site.  \nURANIUM DEMAND AND SUPPLY/DEMAND RELATIONSHIP  \n110 URANIUM 2022: RESOURCES, PRODUCTI ON AND DEMAND, NEA No. 7634, © OECD 2023  In Brazil , two rea ctors (Angra  1 and 2, with 0.5  GWe and 1.3 GWe net capacity, respectively) \nwere operational on 1  January 2021, providing about 2% of electricity generated in the country in \n2020. Construction of the Angra -3 reactor (1.2 GWe net) was restarted in 2010 but w as then \nsuspended in 2015 following cost overruns and corruption issues. Recently, Brazil approved a plan \nto complete Angra 3 in Brazi l’s Investment Partnership Program. The plan allows for \nElectronuclear to recruit a partner to help finance the project and share its ownership (minority \nstake) and operation. The national long -term electricity supply plan includes installing 4  GWe of \nnuclear generating capacity by 2030 to help meet rising energy demand.  \nOther countries in the region, including Bolivia , Chile , Cuba , Uruguay  and Venezuela , do not \nhave nuclear power plants but have been considering developing them. Venezuela has put its nuclear development plans on hold.  \nAfrica  \nNuclear capacity remained constant in Africa, with the regio n’s only two operational reactors \nlocated in South Africa. However, government plans to increase nuclear generating capacity are \nprojected to drive growth in this region. Although several countries are considering adding nuclear \npower plants to the generation mix to help meet rising electricity demand, development of the \nrequired infrastructure and human resources could delay these ambitions.  \nIn South Africa , two operational units (for a total of 1.86  GWe net capacity) accounted for about \n6% of the total electr icity generated in the country in 2020. Early in 2020, South Afric a’s \ngovernment issued a nuclear energy roadmap calling for the development of 2.5 GWe of new \nnuclear capacity, including small modular reactors to bolster employment, enhance energy \nsecurity  and reduce carbon emissions. In June  2020, the government revived prospective nuclear \nnew build plans by issuing a Request for Information to vendors of both large conventional \nreactors and SMRs for information on their technologies and possible financing  strategies.  \nIn Egypt , as of January 1 2021 preparation work was underway to host four VVER -1200 units at \nthe country’s first nuclear power plant at the El Dabaa site. In February 2021, representatives from the Russian and Egyptian governments reported that the COVID -19 pandemic had slowed \npreparations at the site, and by May 2021 the expectation was that a constru ction permit for unit  1 \nwould be issued in July 2022. The Nuclear Power Plants Authority applied to ENRRA for construction permits for units 1 a nd 2 in June 2021. In 2022 construction of the first two units \nstarted. Egyp t’s energy minister and Russia’s Rosatom had previously signed  several contracts, \nincluding a “ turnkey” contract, the supply of nuclear fuel for the plant’s  60-year lifetime, opera tion \nand maintenance for the first 10 years, and a contract for the training of Egyptian personnel. \nPreviously, the Egyptian president had issued a decree approving a USD 25 billion loan from Russia \nto Egypt covering 85% of the project costs.  \nAlthough no o ther countries in Africa have nuclear power plants at this time, several have \nexpressed interest in recent years in developing nuclear power for electricity generation and desalination, including Algeria , Ghana , Kenya , Morocco , Namibia , Niger , Nigeria , Tanzania, \nTunisia  and Uganda .  \nSouth -eastern Asia  \nNo reactors were operational in this region at the end of 2021 but several countries are \nconsidering nuclear development plans, as the region continues to experience strong economic \ngrowth. Concerns about clim ate change, security of energy supply and energy mix \ndiversification along with volatile fossil fuel prices are driving nuclear development policies, but \npolitical support has generally been weak owing to public safety and cost concerns.  \nMalaysia adopted a  target of 2  GWe of nuclear generating capacity in 2011, driven by an \nemerging gap in electricity production and the need to diversify the energy mix. However, it was \nreported that the programme was postponed as a result of public distrust following the \nFukushima Daiichi Nuclear Power Plant accident. Work continues through efforts to promote \nURANIUM DEMAND AND SUPPLY/DEMAND RELATIONSHIP  \nURANIUM 2022: RESOURCES, PRODUCTION AND DEMAND, NEA No. 7634, © OECD 2023  111 public acceptance, adopt the necessary regulations, sign required international treaties and \nobtain low -cost financing.  \nIn Thailand , a revision of the National Energy Policy Council scaled back the planned \ncontribution of nuclear energy to electricity generation from 10% to 5% and set back the \nschedule for the ins tallation of the first unit from 2020 to 2028. The postponements were \nimplemented to ensure safety and improve public understanding of nuclear energy. Currently, \nThailand relies on natural gas to generate over 70% of its electricity.  \nIn Viet Nam , the gove rnment had a goal in the years 2000 for nuclear power to supply as \nmuch as 25% of domestic electricity production by 2050, as a result of increasing electricity demand. In 2015, Rosatom and Electricity of Vietnam signed a framework agreement for the constr uction of unit 1 at the proposed Ninh Thuan Nuclear Power Plant. However shortly after, \nin November 2016, the Vietnamese Parliament voted to abandon its nuclear programme in favour of gas and coal.  \nThe governments of Indonesia , the  Philippines  and Singapo re have considered the use of \nnuclear power to help meet rising electricity demand despite recurring large -scale natural \nhazards. In July 2020, the president of the Philippines issued an executive order to set up an interagency panel to look at creating a national policy for nuclear energy. Coal- fired power \ngeneration accounts for more than half of electricity generation in the Philippines.  \nPacific  \nThis region has no commercial nuclear capacity at present. Current policy prohibits the development of comme rcial nuclear energy in Australia. However, a new interest in nuclear power \nwas prompted by the South Australian premier in 2015 when it was announced that a Royal \nCommission would investigate South Australia’s  future role in the nuclear fuel cycle. In 2019, \nAustrali a’s House of Representatives Standing Committee on the Environment and Energy \ncommenced an inquiry into the prerequisites for nuclear energy production in Australia. The \ncommittee considered a range of matters, including energy affordability and  reliability, economic \nfeasibility and workforce capability, waste management, health and safety, environmental impacts, community engagement and national consensus.  \nProjected nuclear power capacity and related uranium requirements to 2040  \nFactors affectin g nuclear capacity and uranium requirements  \nReactor -related requirements for uranium over the short term are fundamentally determined \nby installed nuclear capacity. Since near -term capacity is made up of reactors that are either \nalready in operation or und er construction, short -term requirements can be projected with \ngreater certainty . However, even with a fixed installed nuclear capacity, uranium requirements \nalso depend on other factors linked to the performance and operation of installed nuclear power \nplants and fuel cycle facilities. These factors include fuel cycle length, enrichm ent level, \ndischarge burn -up, as well as strategies employed to optimise enrichment services according to \nthe price of natural uranium (NatU), as reflected in the level of tails assays chosen in the enrichment phase (see Table 2.3 ). For example, a reduction of the enrichment tails assays from \n0.3 to 0.25% \n235U would, all other factors being equal, reduce uranium demand by about 9.5% and \nincrease enrichment demand by about 11% (the tails assays selected by the enrichment provider \nis dependent on many factors , including the ratio between natural uranium and enrichment \nprices). Generally, increased uranium prices have provided an incentive for utilities to reduce \nuranium requirements by specifying lower tails assays at enrichment facilities, to the extent \npossi ble. \n  \nURANIUM DEMAND AND SUPPLY/DEMAND RELATIONSHIP  \n112 URANIUM 2022: RESOURCES, PRODUCTION AND DEMAND, NEA No. 7634, © OECD 2023  Energy availability and capacity (or load) factors also play an important role in determining \nuranium requirements. Load factors have increased to over 80% in the period 2000- 2010 (IAEA, \n2020). Increased load factors tend to increase uranium require ments. The world average load \nfactor declined to 77.4% in 2011 and further to 73.1% in the period 2012- 2015 (IAEA, 2020b) \nfollowing the Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Power Plant accident. In the period 2019 -2021, the \naverage energy availability factor calculat ed for 446 reactors in the world increased instead again \nto 79.5% (IAEA, 2020b).  \nTable 2.3.

This reduces the amount of uranium required to p roduce contracted \nquantities of enriched uranium and, in turn, creates a stockpile of uranium. In recognition of \nthese recent market trends, and since the 2012 edition of the Red Book, uranium requirements \nfor the operational lifetime of projected new reac tors in this publication have been reduced from \n175 tU/GWe/yr, the original assumption being a tails assay of 0.30%, to 160 tU/GWe/yr, under \nthe new assumption of a tails assay of 0.25% over the lifetime of the reactor. In the absence of \ndata provided by g overnments, this is the uranium requirement factor which has been applied \nin this edition of the Red Book.  \nEnrichment providers have indicated that they are considering re -enrichment of depleted \nuranium tails in modern centrifuge facilities as an economic means of creating additional fissile \nmaterial suitable for use in civil nuclear reactors.  \nWorld uranium requirements, which are defined in the Red Book as anticipated acquisitions, \nnot necessarily consumption, are expected to increase in the coming years as a significant amount of capacity currently under construction comes online, particularly in Asia. Installation of new \nnuclear capacity will increase uranium requirements, not only because of the additional capacity \nthat will have to be fuelled but also because first load fuel requirements are around 60% higher \nthan reloads for plants in operation. The strong performance and economic competitiveness of \nexisting plants, chiefly because of low operating, maintenance and fuel costs, has made retention and im provement of existing plants desirable in many countries. This has resulted in a trend to \nkeep existing plants operating as long as this can be achieved safely and upgrading existing generating capacity where possible (i.e.  long -term operation ). \nSignifican t nuclear build programmes are underway in China and continue in India. \nAlthough the impacts of the global financial crisis have slowed the implementation of ambitious new build plans in some countries, several other nations remain committed to long -term \ngrowth in nuclear generating capacity. Smaller scale programmes to increase nuclear \ngenerating capacity are underway in the Czech Republic and Finland, for example, while Poland \ncontinues to work towards the construction of its first reactors.  \nURANIUM DEMAND AND SUPPLY/DEMAND RELATIONSHIP  \nURANIUM 2022: RESOURCES, PRODUCTION AND DEMAND, NEA No. 7634, © OECD 2023  113  \nBox 2.1. Nu clear power and clean energy transitions  \nNuclear power has avoided about 63 Gt of CO 2 emissions over the past 50 years, a quantity equivalent to \n2 years of global energy -related CO 2 emissions (IEA, 2019). Without nuclear power, emissions from \nelectricity g eneration would have been almost 20% higher. About 90% of the avoided emissions were in \nadvanced economies, with the European Union and United States each avoiding approximately \n22 GtCO 2 (see Figure 2.2 ). Without nuclear power, emissions from electricity g eneration would have \nbeen 25% higher in Japan, 45% higher in Korea and over 50% higher in Canada over the period \n1971-2018 (IEA, 2019).  \n In order to be on track with sustainability targets, including international climate goals, the expansion \nof clean elec tricity would need to be three times faster than at present (IEA, 2019). It would require 85% \nof global electricity to come from clean sources, by 2040 , including nuclear, compared with just 36% \ntoday. In the absence of further lifetime extensions and new nuclear projects, it could result in additional \n4 billion tonnes of CO 2 emissions, underlining the importance of the nuclear fleet to low -carbon energy \ntransitions around the globe.  \nFigure 2. 2. Cumulative CO 2 emissions avoided by nuclear power  \nin selected  countries over the period 1971 -2018  \n \n                         Source: IEA, 2019  \nThe extent to which nuclear energy is seen as instrumental in meeting low -carbon reduction targets will \nhave a clear effect on the role that nuclear energy is able to play in  meeting future electricity demand, \nand therefore, a clear impact in uranium requirements worldwide. As noted in (NEA, 2022), while the \npotential exists for nuclear energy to play a much larger role in global climate change mitigation efforts, \nvarious enab ling conditions would be required . To seize the window of o pportunity, the nuclear sector \nmust move quickly to demonstrate and deploy both near-term and medium- term innovations, including \nGeneration IV and small modular reactors.  \nProjections to 2040  \nProje ctions of nuclear capacity and reactor- related uranium requirements are based on official \nresponses from member countries to questionnaires circulated by the NEA/IAEA and projections \nestablished by an expert group (IAEA/NEA) and published in the IAEA repor t Energy, Electricity \nand Nuclear Power Estimates for the Period up to 2050.  Because of the uncertainty in nuclear \nprogrammes from 2020 onwards, high and low values are provided.

The high case assumes that current rates of economic and \nelectricity demand growth continue. It also assumes changes in country policies towards the \nmitigation of climate change.  \nForecasts of installed capacity and uranium requirements, although uncertain because of \nthe factors mentioned in the previous section, continue to point to long -term growth.  World \ninstalled nuclear capacity (see Table  2.4) in the low case scenario is projected to remain flat \nthrough  2040 (from around 390 GWe at the beginning of 2021 to about 394 GWe by the year 2040) \nor to significantly increase in the high case scenario, to 677 GWe. By 2030, the high case scenario \nprojection sees an increase of 23% with respect to the 2021 level, indicating that significant \nexpansion activities are already underway in several countries, compensating the announced \nnuclear power plant closure p rogrammes in others.  \nTable 2.4.

Over the short term, in both the low and high case, competitive challenges from other ele ctricity generation sources, \nalong with nuclear policy hurdles, will continue to affect nuclear growth in some regions of the world. In addition, new safety requirements have in general strengthened the robustness of \nresponses to extreme events, but the co sts of implementing these measures could reduce the \ncompetitiveness of nuclear power in some liberalised markets.  \nSeveral currently operating reactors, mainly in OECD countries, were set on a path for early \ndecommissioning as a result of economic challeng es or policy decisions. Nevertheless, in 2018, \nconstruction started on the first of four planned reactors in Türkiye and the first formal start of \nnuclear construction in the Western Europe since 2007 began at Hinkley Point C, in the United \nKingdom. The hi gh case projection for Japan sees installed capacity staying about the same, as \nseveral reactors remain in service and ageing units are replaced by new reactors.  \n                                                      \n1  For instance, estimations to 2050 by IEA (2021b) which are considered conservative, project a nuclear \ngenerating capacities of around 810 GWe in 2050. These do not include, like the  estimations presented \nin this work, the potential role that nuclear innovation may play in the future (SMRs or other emerging \nelectric and non -electric applications of nuclear) (NEA, 2022).  \nURANIUM DEMAND AND SUPPLY/DEMAND RELATIONSHIP  \nURANIUM 2022: RESOURCES, PRODUCTION AND DEMAND, NEA No. 7634, © OECD 2023  115 Nuclear capacity projections vary considerably from region to region. The East Asia region \nis projected to experience the largest increase and could result in the installation of between \n33 GWe and 150  GWe of new capacity in the low and high cases, respectively, by the year 2040, \nrepresenting an increase between about 30% and 155% compared with 2020 capacity \nOther regions projected to experience significant nuclear capacity growth include the \nMiddle  East, and the Central and Southern Asia region, notably with India’s ambitious expansion \nplan and several potential newcomer countries (Kazakhstan, Sau di Arabia or Uzbekistan). In the \nhigh case scenario, nuclear capacity in non- EU member countries on the European continent is \nprojected to increase considerably, with 75  GWe of capacity projected by 2040 in the high case \n(increases of about 66% over 2020 c apacity). More modest growth is projected in Africa, Central \nand South America and the South- eastern Asia regions.  \nFor North America, the projections see nuclear generating capacity decreasing by 2040 in both \nthe low and high case, depending largely on fut ure electricity demand, lifetime extension of \nexisting reactors and government policies with respect to greenhouse gas emissions. The reality \nof financial losses at several reactors in the United States has resulted in a larger number of premature shutdown s to be assumed. In Canada, despite the reactor refurbishment programme \nthat will result in the long -term operation of the existing fleet, there is little support for new \nreactor construction in the period to 2040, with the exception of small modular react ors. In the EU, \nnuclear capacity in 2040 is projected to decrease by around 20% in the low case scenario but \nincrease by around 30% in the high case. The low case projection includes the implementation of \nphase -out or reduced nuclear generation policies, c ontinued growth of intermittent renewable \nenergy sources and weak growth in electricity demand. In the high case, phase -out policies are \nmaintained, but plans for the installation of additional nuclear generation capacity are assumed \nto be successfully rea lised in the Czech Republic, Finland, Hungary, Romania, Poland and the \nUnited Kingdom.  \nAs in the case of nuclear capacity, uranium requirements vary considerably from region to \nregion, reflecting projected capacity increases and possible inventory building. Annual uranium requirements are projected to be largest in the East Asia region, wher e increased installed nuclear \ngenerating capacity (particularly in China) drives significant growth in uranium needs. World reactor -related uranium requirements by the year 2040 are projected to increase to a total of \nbetween 63 040 tU/yr in the low case and 108 272 tU/yr in the high case (see Table  2.5). \nTable 2.5.

However, a number of different sources of supply are required to meet demand. The largest is the primar y production of uranium. Secondary sources of uranium \ninclude stockpiles of natural and enriched uranium, blending down weapons -grade uranium, \nreprocessing of spent fuel, underfeeding and the re -enrichment of depleted tails.  \nPrimary sources of uranium supply  \nUranium was produced in 17  countries in 2020 and 2021, with total global production amounting \nto 47  342 tU in 2020 and 47 472 tU in 2021 (see Table 1.18).  \nKazakhstan is the world’s largest producer and remained in that position through 2021, \nbeing resp onsible for over 46% of world uranium production that year. The top six producing \ncountries in 2021 (Kazakhstan, Namibia, Canada, Australia, Uzbekistan and Russia, by order of production) accounted for 88% of world production, while 99% of world uranium pr oduction \ntook place in 10  countries (Kazakhstan, Namibia, Canada, Australia, Uzbekistan, Russia, Niger, \nChina, India and Ukraine).  \nThe COVID -19 pandemic triggered a decrease in the supply of uranium as the main \nproducers suspended uranium operations and te mporarily closed their mines. Nevertheless, the \nsuspension of uranium mining activity is not expected to disrupt the performance of nuclear \npower reactors in the near term as utilities and fuel cycle producers hold significant stocks (see \nsection below on stocks and inventories).

All other countries with \nnuclear power must make use of imported uranium or secondary sources and, as a result, the \ninternational trade of uranium is a necessary and established aspect of the uranium market. \nGiven the uneven geographical distribution between producers and consumers, the safe and \nsecure shipment of nuclear fuel wil l need to continue without unnecessary delays and \nimpediments. The difficulties that some producing countries have encountered with respect to \ninternational shipping requirements and transfers to international ports have therefore always \nbeen a matter of c oncern.  \nFigure 2.4. Uranium production and reactor -related requirements  \nfor major producing and consuming countries  \n(data as of 1 January 2021)  \n \nBecause of the availability of secondary supplies, primary uranium production volumes \nhave been significantl y below world uranium requirements for some time. However, this trend \nhas changed in recent years as production has increased and requirements have declined. In \n2020, world uranium production provided around 74% of world reactor requirements. In OECD \ncount ries, the gap between production and requirements has changed little as both have \ndeclined in the past years. In 2020, production of 10 125 tU provided only around 25% of OECD \nrequirements (39 941 tU).

OECD and world uranium production and requirements  \n \nSecondary sources of uranium supply  \nUranium is unique among energy fuel resources in that, historically, a significant portion of \ndemand has been supplied by secondary s ources rather than direct mine output. These \nsecondary sources include: stocks and inventories of natural and enriched uranium, both civilian and military in origin; nuclear fuel from the reprocessing of spent reactor fuels and from surplus military pluton ium; underfeeding; and uranium produced by the re -enrichment of \ndepleted uranium tails.  \nNatural and enriched uranium stocks and inventories  \nFrom the beginning of commercial exploitation of nuclear power in the late 1950s to 1990, uranium production  consistently exceeded commercial requirements (see Figure 2.6). This was mainly the \nconsequence of a lower than projected growth rate of nuclear generating capacity combined with high levels of production for strategic purposes. This period of over production  created a stockpile \nof uranium potentially available for use in commercial power plants. After 1990, production fell \nwell below demand and secondary supplies fed the market. Since 2008, requirements increased \nslightly before declining again in t he last few years owing to unplanned reactor closures in \nGermany and Japan following the Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Power Plant accident. Uranium \nproduction since 2007 has generally increased and has partially closed the gap between \nproduction and reactor r equirements. The decline in requirements in 2018 was likely related to \nthe reduced number of reactors being refuelled in Japan. More recently, producers have responded \nto the sustained uranium market downturn by temporarily shutting some operations and sca ling \nback uranium production at other mines, causing a slight gap between supply and demand to reappear.  \n   010 00020 00030 00040 00050 00060 00070 00080 000tU/year\nYearWorld production\nOECD productionOECD requirementsWorld requirements\nURANIUM DEMAND AND SUPPLY/DEMAND RELATIONSHIP  \nURANIUM 2022: RESOURCES, PRODUCTION AND DEMAND, NEA No. 7634, © OECD 2023  119 Figure 2.6. World annual uranium production and requirements  \n(1949- 2021)  \n \nFollowing the political and economic changes in Eastern Europe and the for mer Soviet Union \nin the early 1990s, steps were taken to move towards the development of an integrated global \ncommercial market. More uranium is now available from the former Soviet Union, most notably \nfrom Kazakhstan, but also from Russia and Uzbekistan. Despite these developments and more \ninformation being available on the amount of uranium held in inventory by utilities, producers and governments, uncertainties remain regarding the size and the mobility of these inventories, \nas well as the availability o f uranium from other potential secondary supply sources. Although \nit is still early to analyse the long -lasting consequences in the global uranium market, it is clear \nthat the geopolitical crisis triggered by Russia’s invasion of Ukraine in February 2022 c an create \nadditional barriers to the exchange of Russia’s stocks in the international market. These latter \nuncertainties combined with uncertainty about the desired levels of commercial inventories, continues to influence the uranium market.  \nData from past  editions of this publication, along with information provided by member \ncountries, give a rough indication of the maximum level of the potential inventories \ncommercially available when considering cumulative production and requirements for \nuranium at the global level. This leaves an estimated remaining stock of around 525  000 tU, \nwhich is a rough estimate of the upper limit of what could potentially become available to the commercial sector (see Figure  2.7). This base of already mined uranium has essential ly been \ndistributed into two sectors, with the majority used and/or reserved for the military and the \nremainder used or stockpiled by the civilian sector. However, since the end of the Cold War, \nincreasing amounts of uranium, previously reserved for strate gic purposes, have been released \nto the commercial sector.  \n  10 00030 00050 00070 000\n1960 1980 2000 2020tU/y\nProdu ction\nRequi reme nts\nURANIUM DEMAND AND SUPPLY/DEMAND RELATIONSHIP  \n120 URANIUM 2022: RESOURCES, PRODUCTI ON AND DEMAND, NEA No. 7634, © OECD 2023  Figure 2.7. World cumulative uranium production and requirements  \n(1949- 2021)  \n \nCivilian inventories include strategic stocks, pipeline inventory and commercial stocks \navailable to the market. In recent years, material held by financial investors has been a part of \nthe inventory. Utilities are believed to hold the majority of commercial stocks because many \nhave policies that require them to carry the equivalent of one to several years of natural \nuranium requirements. Despite the importance of this secondary source of uranium, \ninformation about the size of these stocks is limited because few countries are able or willing, \nbecause of confidentiality concerns, to provide detailed information on stockpiles held by \nproducers, consumers or governments.  \nIn the United States, as of 1 January 2021, total commercial inventories (utilities and \nproducers’ stocks) were 54  483 tU (EIA, 2021). Around 76% of the commercial inventories were \nheld by owners and operat ors of commercial reactors. Enriched uranium inventories held by \nutilities (including fuel elements in storage) in 2021 (around 20  145 tU) were up around 8% from \ntheir 2019 values, whereas natural uranium inventories held by utilities (including UF 6 in sto rage) \nhave decreased 10% from their 2019 values (EIA, 2021).  \nIn the European Union, uranium inventories (still including UK inventories) held by utilities \nat the end of 2020 totalled 42 396 tU, enough for an average of more than two years’ fuel supply, \nand down around 7% since the end of 2018 (ESA, 2020 and 2021) (see Table 2.6).  \nUranium requirements are growing rapidly in East Asia, in particular in China. By 2040, \ndemand in this region is expected to be roughly equivalent and even surpass (in the high ca se \nscenario) that of North America and the EU together. Questionnaire responses received during \nthe compilation of this edition revealed little about national inventory policies in the East Asia \nregion. Based on import statistics, it is estimated (WNA, 202 1) that as of 1 January 2021, China \nhad an accumulated inventory of over 129  000 tU, while I ndia held an inventory of 9  600 tU. It is \nassumed that these countries are holding these stocks in anticipation of increasing uranium requirements due to the signif icant number of reactors under construction and planned, and \nalso for strategic purposes.  0123\n196 0 198 0 200 0 202 0millions of tonnes\nProdu ction\nRequi reme nts\nURANIUM DEMAND AND SUPPLY/DEMAND RELATIONSHIP  \nURANIUM 2022: RESOURCES, PRODUCTION AND DEMAND, NEA No. 7634, © OECD 2023  121 Table 2.6.

Although commercially confidential, variable and largely \ndependent on uranium price dynamics, the US Energy Information Administratio n notes that \nUS-based traders and brokers held about 9  600 tU as of 1 January 2021 (EIA, 2021), an almost \nthreefold increase compared to the levels at the end of 2016.  \nExcess uranium inventories held by the US government were last reported in 2013. At tha t \ntime, the government possessed 56 031 tU, which includes 17 596 tU of uranium concentrates, \n12 485 tU of enriched uranium, and 25  950 tU of depleted uranium. In May 2014, the US \nGovernment Accountability Office reported that as of 31 December 2012, the U S Department of \nEnergy maintained an excess uranium inventory of 29 tU in highly enriched uranium (HEU); 48 tU in low -enriched uranium (LEU); 12 939 tU in natural uranium; 114 000 tU in high -assay \ndepleted uranium tails; and 387 000 tU in low -assay deplete d uranium tails. A DOE Secretarial \nDetermination must be made in advance of sales or transfers of these inventories in order to provide assurance that the transactions will not have an adverse material impact on the domestic uranium mining, conversion or e nrichment industries.  \nIn the calendar year 2015, the DOE Secretarial Determination authorised the transfer of up \nto 2 000 tU to DOE contractors for clean -up services at the Portsmouth gaseous diffusion plant \nand up to 500  tNatU to the National Nuclear Sec urity Administration (NNSA) for blending down \nHEU to low -enriched uranium (LEU). Other transactions involved the transfer of up to 9  082 t of \ndepleted uranium (DU) to Energy Northwest in 2012 and 2013, the majority of which would be \nenriched for use in the  company’s power reactor and the remainder sold to TVA as part of a \ncommercial transaction to support future power generation and tritium production from 2013 \nthrough 2030. In 2016, the US  DOE Secretary determined that exchange of LEU to HEU down -\nblending services serves national security purposes and that in this case the transfers no longer \nrequire a Secretarial Determination.  \nIn 2017, the US DOE issued a new Secretarial Determination that further reduces transfers \nof material to support Portsmouth gaseo us diffusion plant clean -up work to 1  200 tU as natural \nUF\n6. \nIn 2018, the Secretary of Energy issued a determination covering the transfer of low -\nenriched uranium in support of the tritium production mission. The Secretarial Determination \nestablishes the national security purpose of these transfers, therefore these uranium transfers \nwere conducted under Section 3112(e)(2) of the USEC Privatisation Act of 1996.  \nURANIUM DEMAND AND SUPPLY/DEMAND RELATIONSHIP  \n122 URANIUM 2022: RESOURCES, PRODUCTI ON AND DEMAND, NEA No. 7634, © OECD 2023  Large stocks of uranium, previously dedicated to the military in both the United  States and \nRussi a, have become available for commercial applications, bringing a significant secondary \nsource of uranium to the market. Despite the programmes outlined below, the remaining \ninventory of HEU and natural uranium held in various forms by these governments is significant, \nalthough official figures on strategic inventories are not available. If additional disarmament \ninitiatives are undertaken to further reduce strategic inventories, several years of global supply of \nNatU for commercial applications could be mad e available.  \nHEU from Russia  \nRussia and the United States signed a 20 -year, government -to-government agreement in \nFebruary 1993 for the conversion of 500 t of Russian HEU from nuclear warheads to LEU suitable \nfor use as nuclear fuel (referred to as the Megatons to Megawatts agreement). The United States \nEnrichment Corporation (USEC), the executive agent for this agreement, purchased the \nenrichment component of the LEU, about 5.5 million SWU per year, from Techsnabexport (TENEX) of Russia. Under a separate agreement, the natural uranium feed component of the HEU purchase agreement was sold under a commercial arrangement between three western \ncorporations (Cameco, Areva and Nukem) and TENEX. Deliveries under this government -to-\ngovernment agreement were finalis ed at the end of 2013. As of 2022, it is clear that the changing \ngeopolitical scene will see western utilities seeking western uranium enrichment services and \nfuel providers.  \nHEU from the United States  \nAs of June 2015, the US DOE reported 15 t of unalloca ted HEU. Following the current campaign, \nthe National Nuclear Security Administration (NNSA) plans to conduct a HEU down -blending \noffering for tritium (DBOT) programme in the fiscal years 2019 -2025.  \nFuel banks  \nEfforts by governments and international agen cies have also resulted in actions to create \nnuclear fuel banks – another form of inventory.  \nDriven by rising energy needs, non -proliferation and waste concerns, governments and the \nIAEA have made a number of proposals aimed at strengthening non -prolifera tion by \nestablishing multilateral enrichment and fuel supply centres.  \nIn December 2010, the first LEU reserve was inaugurated in Russia at the International \nUranium Enrichment Centre in Angarsk under IAEA auspices. This LEU reserve is comprised of \n120 t LEU in the form of UF 6 enriched to 2% -4.95% 235U. Under IAEA safeguards, the reserve will be \nmade available to IAEA member states whose supplies of LEU are disrupted for reasons unrelated \nto technical or commercial issues. The LEU reserve is not intended to distort the functioning of the commercial market, but rather to reinforce existing market mechanisms of member states.  \nAlso in December 2010, the IAEA Board of Governors authorised the IAEA Director -General \nto establish a LEU bank to serve as a supply of last resort for nuclear power generation. The IAEA reserve is a backup mechanism to the commercial market in the event that an eligible member \nstate’s supply of LEU is disrupted and cannot be restored by commercial means. In May 2015, \nKazakhstan signed a d raft agreement with the IAEA to host the IAEA LEU bank at the Ulba \nMetallurgical Plant. The IAEA LEU bank is a physical reserve of up to 90 metric tons of low -\nenriched uranium suitable to make fuel for a typical light water reactor. In 2018, the IAEA signed \ncontracts to purchase LEU, paving the way towards the establishment of the IAEA LEU Bank in \n2019. The IAEA LEU Bank was established and became operational on 17 October 2019. The \nestablishment and operation of the IAEA LEU bank is fully funded by volunta ry contributions. \nDonors have provided a total of USD 150 million to establish the LEU Bank and operate it for at least ten years. Donors include the Nuclear Threat Initiative (NTI), the United States, the European Union, the United Arab Emirates, Kuwait, Norway and Kazakhstan.  \nURANIUM DEMAND AND SUPPLY/DEMAND RELATIONSHIP  \nURANIUM 2022: RESOURCES, PRODUCTION AND DEMAND, NEA No. 7634, © OECD 2023  123 Nuclear fuel produced by reprocessing spent reactor fuels and surplus weapons -related \nplutonium  \nThe constituents of spent fuel from nuclear power plants are a potentially substantial source of \nfissile material that could displace primary uranium production. When spent fuel is discharged \nfrom a commercial reactor, it is potentially recyclable since more than 90% of the original \nmaterial is essentially made up of uranium -238, along with the plutonium and remaining \nuranium -235. The recyc led plutonium can be reused in reactors licensed to use mixed oxide \n(MOX) fuel. The uranium recovered through reprocessing of spent fuel, known as reprocessed uranium (RepU), is not routinely recycled; rather, it is stored for future reuse.  \nThe use of MOX has not altered world uranium demand since only a relatively small number \nof reactors are using this type of fuel. As of January 2021, there were 25 reactors, or around 5% \nof the world’s operating fleet, licensed to use MOX fuel, in France, India, and the Netherlands (see Table  2.1). Reprocessing and MOX fuel fabrication facilities exist or are under construction \nin France, India, Japan and Russia. China is also building a pilot processing plant (200  tHM/yr) \nthat is planned to be operational in the mid -2020 s.  \nFollowing on basic research and MOX fuel fabrication for experimental reactors by the Japan \nAtomic Energy Agency (JAEA), Japan Nuclear Fuel Ltd (JNFL) began testing plutonium separation at the Rokkasho reprocessing facility in 2006. Japanese utilities began using MOX initially in fuel \nmanufactured overseas. The use of imported MOX fuel was to be followed by the use of MOX \nproduced at JNFL’s MOX fuel fabrication facility (JMOX) adjacent to the Rokkasho reprocessing plant. JMOX construction began in 2010.  Under the latest schedule, completion of the \nreprocessing plant has been put back to the first half  of 2023 while the JMOX plant still needs to \npass further checks on its construction plans before it can start operations, with currently no official date f or the start of commercial operations.  \nFollowing the closure in 2003 of the Cadarache MOX fuel production plant in France and the \nMOX fuel plant in Belgium (Belgonucleaire) in 2006, the MELOX plant in Marcoule, France, was licensed in 2007 to increase annu al production from 145  tHM to 195  tHM of MOX fuel \n(corresponding to 1  560 tNatU). Annual MOX production in France varies below this licensed \ncapacity, in accordance with contracted quantities. Most of the MOX production is used to fuel French nuclear power  plants (a total of about 120  t/yr; 960  tNatU) and the remainder is delivered \nabroad under long -term contract arrangements.  \nThe Euratom Supply Agency (ESA) reported that the quantity of plutonium contained in the \nMOX fuel loaded into nuclear power plants in the EU was 5 308 kg in 2020, a slight increase over the 5 241 kg used in 2019 (ESA, 2021). Use of plutonium in MOX fuel reduced natural uranium \nrequirements in the EU by an estimated 481  tU in 2020. In the 1996- 2021 period, MOX fuel use in \nEU reactors has displaced a cumulative total of 25  922 tU through the use of 238.2  t of Pu (ESA, \n2021). Since the great majority of world MOX use occurs in Western Europe, this figure provides a \nreasonable estimate of the impact of MOX use worldwide on uranium requireme nts during that \nperiod. Responses to the questionnaire provide some additional data on the production and use \nof MOX (see Table  2.7). \nUranium recovery through reprocessing of spent fuel, known as RepU, has been conducted in \nthe past in several countries, including Belgium and Japan (see Table 2.8). It is now routinely undertaken only in France and Russia, principally because the production of RepU is a relatively \ncostly endeavour, in part because of the requirement for dedicated conversion, enrichment and \nfabrication facilities. Available data indicate that it represents less than 1% of projected annual \nworld requirements. Reprocessing could become a more significant source of nuclear fuel supply \nin the future if China successfully commercialises the process. It was reported that China planned \nto move beyond conducting research and development of reprocessing and recycling technologies \nto build and operate a large -scale commercial facility with a capacity of about 800  tHM/yr in order \nto achieve maximum utilisation of uranium resources, given the country’s rapidly rising requirements. Since 2007, China and France have reportedly been discussing the possibility of France supplying a commercial -scale recycling facility.  \nURANIUM DEMAND AND SUPPLY/DEMAND RELATIONSHIP  \n124 URANIUM 2022: RESOURCES, PRODUCTI ON AND DEMAND, NEA No. 7634, © OECD 2023  Table 2.7.

Rows with countries that did not report any data in past years were suppressed.  \nMOX produced from surplus weapons -related plutonium  \nIn September 2000, the United States and Russia signed the Plutonium Management and \nDisposition Agreement that committed each country to dispose of 34  t of surplus weapons-\ngrade plutonium at a rate of at least 2  tonnes per year in each country, once production facilities \nare in place. Both countries agreed to dispose of the surplus plutonium by fabricating MOX fuel suitable for irradiation in commercial nuclear reactors.  \nIn the United States, the MOX fuel was to be fabricated at the DOE’s Savannah River complex \nin South Carolina. The DOE’s NNSA awarded a contract for construction of the Mixed Oxide Fuel Fabrication Facility (MFFF) in 2001 and construction was officially started in 2007. In mid -2013, \nhowever, it was reported that the project had encountered technical difficulties and was running over budget. Since 2014, the project has seen progressive cuts to its funding as th e DOE’s National \nNuclear Safety Administration embarked on a review of its plutonium disposition strategy. The \nDOE NNSA terminated the MOX project in October 2018. The facility was being built as part of the \n2000 agreement with Russia whereby each country would dispose of 34  tonnes of weapons -grade \nplutonium. Russia –  which had agreed to dispose of the material in fast reactors –  suspended the \nagreement in October 2016.  \nURANIUM DEMAND AND SUPPLY/DEMAND RELATIONSHIP  \nURANIUM 2022: RESOURCES, PRODUCTION AND DEMAND, NEA No. 7634, © OECD 2023  125 The Russian MOX facility was reportedly abandoned in favour of burning excess plutonium \nin fast breeder reactors (WNA, 2017). A MOX fuel fabrication facility established by Mining and \nChemical Combine (MCC) Zheleznogorsk, a Rosatom subsidiary, was officially started in 2015. \nRussia has no commercial reactors using MOX fuel, but its BN -800 fas t neutron reactor will use \nMOX fuel. In August 2020, the MCC has received a five -year licence for the industrial production \nof MOX fuel for the Beloyarsk -4 BN -800 fast neutron reactor.  \nUranium produced by re -enrichment of depleted uranium tails2 and uraniu m saved \nthrough underfeeding  \nDepleted uranium stocks represent a significant source of uranium that could displace primary \nproduction. However, the re -enrichment of depleted uranium has been limited since it is only \neconomic in enrichment plants with spare  capacity and low operating costs.  \nThe world stock of depleted uranium in 2021 is of around 1.2 million tonnes, with around \n50 000 tonnes of depleted uranium being added  yearly to already substantial stockpiles in the \nUnited States, Europe and Russia (WNA, 2021). Following the construction of new centrifuge \nenrichment facilities and declining demand since the Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Power Plant \naccident, spare enrichmen t capacity is currently available, and it has been reported that tails \nassays are being driven downward at enrichment facilities to underfeed the centrifuge plants \nand create additional uranium inventory.  \nEU enrichers are now putting in place long -term strategies to manage enrichment tails \nremaining from enrichment activities, including deconversion of UF 6 to the more stable form \nU3O8. Currently, deconversion takes place in France, and Urenco UK is constructing a tails \nmanagement facility.  \nIn the United States, the DOE and the Bonneville Power Administration initiated a pilot \nproject to re -enrich 8  500 tonnes of the DOE’s enrichment tails inventory. Between 2005 and \n2006, this project produced approximately 1 940 tU equivalent for use between 2007 and 2015 at \nNorthwest Energy’s 1 190 MWe Columbia generating station. In mid -2012, Northwest Energy \nand USEC, in conjunction with the DOE, developed a new plan to re -enrich a second portion of \nDOE’s high assay tails. The resulting LEU is to be used to fuel Northwest Energy’s Columbia generating station through 2028.  \nGE-Hitachi Global Laser Enrichment proposed to build and operate a tails processing plant \nusing Silex laser enrichment technology on land adjacent to the closed Paducah gaseous diffusion  \nenrichment plant. Successful development of laser enrichment could potentially result in an additional supply of uranium to the market in the longer term. However, GE -Hitachi Global Laser \nEnrichment recently announced plans to slow development of its lase r technology because of poor \nmarket conditions.

(b) Purchased for subsequent re -enrichment.  \nUnderfeeding  \nThe potential for underfeeding  of enrichment plants is also a source of secondary supply, which \nhas become more important in the last few years. Underfeeding reduces the amount of uranium \nrequired to produce contracted quantities of enriched uranium and, in turn, creates a stockpile of  \nuranium that can be sold. It is estimated that g lobal underfeeding and tails re -enrichment \ncontribute up to 6  000 tU of supply per year (WNA, 2019).  \nIn recent years, secondary supply has shown a downward trend resulting from the end of \nthe “Megatons to M egawatt” agreement. The level of secondary supply is currently around \n10 500 tU/yr and is likely to decrease to about 6 000 to 7  000 tU/yr by 2040 (WNA, 2022).  \nUranium market developments  \nUranium prices  \nSome national and international authorities (Australia, the United States and Euratom), publish \nprice indicators to illustrate uranium price trends for both long -term and short -term (spot price) \ncontract arrangements. Australian data record average annual prices paid for exports, whereas \nEuratom (ESA) and U S data show costs of uranium purchases in a particular year. Canada and \nNiger published export prices for some years, but neither continue to do so. Figure 2.8 displays \nthis mix of annual prices reported for both short -term and longer -term purchases and ex ports.  \nThe overproduction of uranium, which lasted through 1990 (see Figure 2.6), combined with \nthe availability of secondary sources, resulted in uranium prices trending downward from the \nearly 1980s through the mid -1990s, bringing about significantly red uced expenditures in many \nsectors of the world uranium industry, including exploration and production. The bankruptcy \nof an important uranium trading company resulted in a modest recovery in prices from late \n1994 through mid -1996, but the regime of low pri ces returned shortly thereafter.  \nBeginning in 2002, uranium prices began to increase, eventually rising to levels not seen since \nthe 1980s. They then rose more rapidly through 2005 and 2006, with spot prices reaching a peak \nthrough 2007 and 2008, and fell off rapidly, recovering somewhat in 2011 and declining in 2012 \n(see Figures  2.8 and 2. 9). In contrast, EU and US long -term price indices continued to rise until 2011 \nbefore levelling off in 2012, and then started to decline until 2019. Fluctuations in these indicators \ndo not rival the peak in the spot market in 2007 and 2008 or the degree of  declining prices since \n2011 since they reflect contract arrangements made earlier under different price regimes. The \nAustralia average export price has generally followed the trend of other long -term price indices, \nbut with greater variation since it is a  mix of spot and long -term contract prices.  \nURANIUM DEMAND AND SUPPLY/DEMAND RELATIONSHIP  \nURANIUM 2022: RESOURCES, PRODUCTION AND DEMAND, NEA No. 7634, © OECD 2023  127 Figure 2.8.

While the trend of increasing prices \noutlined above is evident for spot market transactions since 2002, and in particular after 2004, the \nspot price shows more volatility than long -term pric e indicators since 2006 (see Figure 2.9). In June \n2007, the spot market price reached as high as USD  136/lb U 3O8 (USD  354/kgU) before declining to \nUSD 40.50/lb U 3O8 (USD  105/kgU) in February 2010. It recovered to USD  72.25/lb U 3O8 (USD  188/kgU) \nat the end of January 2011, before declining to USD  27/lb U 3O8 (USD  70.2/kgU) at the end of 2018 \n(see Figure 2.9). In May 2019, the spot market price declined to USD  24/lb U 3O8 (USD  62.4/kgU). In \nJune 2021, the spot price was USD 32.40/lb U 3O8 (USD 84.2/kgU).  \nA variety of factors have been advanced to account for the spot price dynamics between 2003 \nand 2020, including problems experienced in nuclear fuel cycle production centres that \nhighlighted dependence on a few critical facilities in the supply chain, as w ell as changes in the \nvalue of the US dollar, the currency used in uranium transactions. The expected expansion of \nnuclear power generation in countries such as China, India and Russia, combined with the \nrecognition by many governments of the role that nuc lear energy can play in enhancing security \nof energy supply, contributed to the strengthening market through 2007. The influence of \nspeculators in the market helped accelerate upward price movement at this time. The downturn \nin the spot price since June 20 07 began with the reluctance on behalf of traditional buyers to \npurchase at such high prices and the global financial crisis that stimulated sales by distressed sellers needing to raise capital.  \nIn late 2007, the uranium spot price began a gradual decline that settled in 2009 in a range \nbetween USD  40/lb U\n3O8 (USD  104/kgU) and USD  50/lb U 3O8 (USD  130/kgU). Proposed US  \ngovernment inventory sales appeared to offset rising demand as government programmes in China and India to increase nuclear generating capac ity began to be implemented. In the second \nhalf of 2010, the spot price began to rally once again on news that China was active in the long -\nterm market, stimulating speculative activity on perceptions of tightening supply -demand. \nHowever, the Fukushima Dai ichi Nuclear Power Plant accident precipitated an initial rapid \ndecline in price. Projects to increase uranium production, implemented before the accident, resulted in increasing production even as demand weakened and the market became saturated \nwith suppl y, putting further downward pressure on prices through to the end of 2019. In \naddition, the excess uranium inventories and the decline in uranium needs as a result of the \nsubstitution of enrichment (underfeeding) contributed to the downdraught in uranium p rices. \nSignificant uranium production cuts have been made during 2018 -2019 (e.g.  McArthur River \nmine in Canada) contributing to high spot purchasing levels as producers and traders bought material to cover near -term delivery commitments. The significant rise in the spot price seen \nin March and April 2020 was precipitated largely by additional curtailments to primary \nproduction brought on by the COVID -19 pandemic.  \nThe uranium market was also impacted by macroeconomic trends. The strengthening of \nthe US doll ar in recent years, especially in relation to the currencies of major uranium producers \n(e.g. Canadian dollar, Kazakh tenge, Russian rouble and South African rand) contributed to the \nuranium price volatility. Non -US mining companies have benefited from US dollar appreciation \nagainst these currencies, as most of their operating costs, including labour, are in their domestic \ncurrencies. This allowed them to keep operating the mines despite falling uranium market \nprices, expressed in US dollars.  \nThe uranium market could be further affected by developments on both the demand and \nsupply side. Demand factors include Japanese restarts and successful global new builds. Key \nconsiderations on the supply side include uranium production levelling off in the short term as \nwell as possible limitations on government inventories. When looking at the longer -term \noutlook, there is a general agreement that nuclear growth is likely to continue. Asia and the \nMiddle East are the most critical markets for new reactors, and new ura nium production will be \nneeded in the coming decades. However, new uranium supply capacity would need the right \nprice signals for producers to make investments.  \nURANIUM DEMAND AND SUPPLY/DEMAND RELATIONSHIP  \nURANIUM 2022: RESOURCES, PRODUCTION AND DEMAND, NEA No. 7634, © OECD 2023 129 Policy m easures in t he EU and uranium prices \nSince its establishment in 1960 under the Euratom  Treaty, the Supply Agency of the European \nAtomic Energy Community (ESA) has pursued a policy of di versification of sources of nuclear \nfuel supply to avoid o verdependence on any singl e source. Within the European Union, all \nuranium purchase contracts by EU  end users (i.e.  nuclear utilities) must be concurr ed by the \nESA. Based on its contractual role and its close relatio ns with industry, the ESA monitors the \nmarket with a particula r focus on supplies of natural and enriched uranium to the EU. The ESA \ncontinues to stress the importance of maintaining an adequate level of strategic inventory and \nusing market opportunities to increase inventories, where possible. It also  recommends that \nutilities cover the majority of their needs under long -term contracts with diverse suppliers and \nit continues to promote transparency and predictability in the market.  \nUranium purchased for EU reactors came from diverse sources in 2021 (ESA, 2021). The top \nfive providers amounted to more than 96% of all uranium purchased by EU ut ilities. In decreasing \norder of percentage of uranium provided, these were: Niger (24%), Kazakhstan  (23%), Russia (20%), \nAustralia (16%), and Canada (14%). Uranium of European origin delivered to EU utilities covered \nless than 2% of the EU’s total purchase s (ESA, 2021).  \nSince uranium is sold mostly under long -term contracts and the terms are not  made public, \nthe ESA traditionally publishes two categories of natural uranium prices on an annual basis, \ni.e. multi-annual  and spo t, bo th being historical prices calculated ov er a period of many years. \nWith at least some uranium market participants seeking greater price tra nspa rency, the ESA \nintroduced a new natural uranium multi -annual contracts index price (MAC -3) in 2009. This  \nindex price, developed to better reflect short -term changes in uranium prices and to more \nclosely track market trends, is a three -year moving average of prices paid under new multi -\nannual long-t erm contracts for uranium delivered to EU utilities  in t he reporting year (see  \nTable 2 .10).\nTable 2.10.

Market prices have generally increased since 2003, and plans for increasing \nproduction capability continued through 2021. A  number of countries, notably Australia, Brazil, \nCanada, China, India, N amibia, Niger, Russia and South Africa, have plans for significant additions \nto future production capability. Some other countries, notably Botswana, Denmark/Greenland, \nFinland, Mauritania, Mongolia and Tanzania are working towards producing uranium in the  near \nfuture. These developments are important as global demand is projected to increase in the longer \nterm, and secondary sources are expected to decline somewhat in availability.  \nHowever, with rising mining and development costs and the long pause in nu clear \ndevelopment following the Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Power Plant accident, along with the \ncontinuing decline of market prices through 2019, delays in some of the planned mine \ndevelopments have been announced. Uranium production has also slowed at a nu mber of existing \nfacilities because of poor market conditions. The most significant of these changes was the \nsuspension of Canada’s McArthur River mine and Key Lake mill, following a series of production \ncuts to Kazakh production, a reduction to Niger uran ium output, and cessation of production at \nLanger Heinrich project in Namibia. Meanwhile, many ISL mines in the United  States are facing a \nsituation in which no new capital is being invested into developing new wellfields. In addition, \nover the first part of 2020, the COVID -19 pandemic significantly impacted production, with many \nmines temporarily closed. An improvement in uranium market conditions should see at least \nsome of the delayed projects or the mines in care and maintenance reactivated in order to ensure \nsupply to a growing global nuclear fleet. Since several of these projects have advanced through \nregulatory and other development steps, the time required to bring these facilities into production should be reduced overall, and production will likely  be able to respond more rapidly to increasing \ndemand.  \nDespite some uncertainties and challenges in raising investment for mine development, \nproducers have moved to increase production capability in recent years and governments are laying the groundwork (e .g. legislation and regulations) for mine development in countries that \nhave not previously hosted uranium production. However, should uranium demand increase as projected, producers would still face a number of significant and unpredictable issues in brin ging \nnew production facilities on stream, including geopolitical and policy factors (e.g.  from the ban on \nnew uranium mine development in Western Australia, to terrorist attacks in Niger and a global \npandemic), technical challenges and risks at some facilities, the development of more stringent \nregulatory requirements and heightened expectations of governments hosting uranium mining \n(e.g. increased taxes and contributions to regional socio -economic development).  \nAs reactor requirements are projected to ris e through 2040, production capability is also \nprojected to expand (see Figure 2.10). As noted earlier, secondary sources can be expected to \ncontinue to be a source of supply for some years, despite a general downward trend.  \nIf all existing and committed mi nes (A -II) produce at or near stated production capability, \nhigh case demand is projected to be met through 2025 (without taking into account the secondary supplies). If planned and perspective production capability is included (B- II), high \ncase demand req uirements are projected to be met through 2035. Planned capability from all \nexisting and committed production centres is currently projected to cover around 78% of low \ncase requirements through 2040 and about 46% of high case requirements in 2040. With the  \ninclusion of planned and prospective production centres, primary production capability would \nmore than satisfy low case requirements through 2040, would cover all high case demand \nthrough 2035 and around 91% of the high case demand in 2040.  \nHowever, real mine production is rarely more than 85% of a mine’s production capability and \nseveral challenges will need to be overcome in order for all planned and prospective uranium \nprojects to be successfully brought into production. Figure 2.10 also g ives, therefore, an overview \nof the supply/demand relationship with global production capability at 85% of mine production \ncapability. In this case, a gap is identified for the high case reactor requirements scenario starting \nwith 2025 and can be filled wi th secondary supply or new projects.   \nURANIUM DEMAND AND SUPPLY/DEMAND RELATIONSHIP  \nURANIUM 2022: RESOURCES, PRODUCTION AND DEMAND, NEA No. 7634, © OECD 2023  131 Figure 2.10.

Meeting high case demand \nrequirements would consume by 2040 around 26% of the total 2021 identified recoverable \nresource base at a cost of <USD 130/kgU (USD  50/lb  U3O8). If lower cost resources are considered \n(<USD  80/kgU; USD 30/lb U 3O8), the high case demand would correspond to around 80% of the \nidentified recoverable resource base by 2040. With the appropriate market signals, as significant \nnew nuclear generating capacity is added, additional resources of economic interest are likely to be identified with additional exploration efforts.  \nThe gap between production and requirements from 2008 (and earlier) to 2014 has been met \nby drawing down secondary supplies. In 2014, producers almost closed the gap between world production and reactor requirements, albeit with requirements temporarily depressed owing to \nreactor closures and idling of reactors in Japan following the Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Power \nPlant accident. However, following the production cuts and the reductions due to the COVID -19 \npandemic in 2020, a gap between demand and primary supply appeared again. Furthermore, it \nshould be noted that production capability is not production. Maintaining production at the level \nrequired to meet reactor requirements in the coming years, partic ularly in light of uncertainties \nrelated to the COVID -19 pandemic and depressed market prices for uranium, will be a challenge.  \nWorld production has varied between 70% and 90% of full production capability since 2008. In \naddition, delays in the establishme nt of new production centres can reasonably be expected, \nespecially in the prevailing risk -averse investment environment. As always, technical and \ngeopolitical challenges in the operation and development of mine and mill facilities will need to \nbe effectiv ely dealt with. These factors can be expected to reduce and/or delay development of \nplanned and prospective centres. Although the industry has responded vigorously to the market \nsignal of generally higher prices since 2003, compared to the previous 20 years, additional primary \nproduction will likely be required. As secondary sources of uranium are generally expected to \ndecline somewhat in availability, reactor requirements will have to be increasingly met by primary production. Therefore, despite the signif icant additions to production capability reported here, \nbringing facilities into production in a timely fashion remains important. To do so, strong uranium \nmarket conditions will be fundamental in bringing the required investment to the industry.  \nA key unc ertainty of the uranium market continues to be the availability and the mobility \nof secondary sources, particularly the level of stocks available and the length of time remaining \nuntil those stocks are exhausted. However, the possibility that at least a po rtion of the \npotentially large inventory (including from the military) will continue to make its way to the \nmarket after 2022 cannot be discounted. These uncertainties complicate investment decisions \non new production capability. Another limiting factor for investment decisions is that uranium demand outlook in the near - to medium -term is driven primarily by the large number of \nreactors that are scheduled to close (e.g.  in Europe and the United States), which offsets the \ngrowth from new nuclear power plants  in other countries (e.g.  China).  \nIt is clear that the generally stronger market of the 2003- 2011 period, compared to the last \ntwo decades of the 20\nth century, has driven exploration activity, building up a significant base \nof uranium resources. However, history shows that periods of low prices for uranium and reliance on secondary supplies have had dramatic impacts on the industry in terms of \nconsolidation of producers and significant reductions in primary production capability.  \nThe long -term perspective  \nGlobal uranium demand is fundamentally driven by the number of operating reactors in the world, \nwhich ultimately is driven by the demand for electricity. In turn, the role that nuclear energy will \nplay in helping meet projected electricity demand (i.e.  the number of operating reactors) will \ndepend on government policy decisions that affect nuclear power plant development and on how \neffectively a number of factors discussed earlier are addressed (e.g.  economics, safety, security of \nenergy supply, security of supply chain, waste disposal, environmental considerations). The \nextent to which nuclear power will be part of future low -carbon electricity mixes thus also \ndepends on ongoing energy policy discussions in countries the world over.  \nURANIUM DEMAND AND SUPPLY/DEMAND RELATIONSHIP  \nURANIUM 2022: RESOURCES, PRODUCTION AND DEMAND, NEA No. 7634, © OECD 2023  133 All credible  models show that nuclear energy has an important role to play in decarbonisation \nand global climate change mitigation efforts (e.g.  NEA, 2022; IEA, 2021) as an established large-\nscale, low -carbon emissions energy source. However, industry must first receive clear and \nconsistent policy support for existing and new capacity development, with nuclear also included \nin clean energy incentive schemes schemes, as well as indications that a supply of uranium is \nreadily available at least 50 years or more into the future. Recognising the importance of the \nsecurity of supply, reliability and predictability that nuclear power offers and promoting incentives for all types of low -carbon electricity production are key conditions for a faster \ndeployment of nuclear power. The expansion of nuclear power is mainly policy -driven and faces \nchallenges due to large upfront capital costs, complex project manag ement requirements and \noften long permitting processes. Without actions to provide more support for nuclear power, \nglobal efforts to mitigate climate change will become significantly harder and more costly (IEA, \n2019), as it is clearly established that ach ieving net zero globally will be harder without nuclear \n(IEA, 2022).   \nThe NEA study, Unlocking Reductions in the Construction Costs of Nuclear: A Practical Guide for \nStakeholders (NEA, 2020b) highlights that while industry has made major efforts in terms o f \norganisational restructuring and integration of a number of recent technological advances, governments also have a role regarding significant construction costs and risk reductions by \ncommitting to the next set of new build projects. With several project s under completion in \nOECD countries, the next decade offers opportunities to capitalise on the experience \naccumulated to improve the economic performance of both traditional large reactors and new innovative designs.  \nAs the recent NEA report Meeting Clim ate Change Targets: The Role of Nuclear Energy (NEA, 2022)  \nnotes, rapid build -out of new nuclear energy is possible but requires a clear vision and plan. \nExperience shows that under the right policy frameworks and a robust programmatic approach, nuclear en ergy can be a low -carbon technology with rapid delivery times. This was the case \nhistorically for countries such as France and Sweden and jurisdictions such as Ontario in Canada that have both decarbonised their electricity mix in less than two decades wit h nuclear \nenergy and hydropower.  \nSeveral alternative uses of nuclear energy also have the potential to increase nuclear power \ninstallation worldwide, including desalination and heat production for industrial and residential \npurposes. Cogeneration, combining industrial heat applications with electricity generation, is not \na new concept; some of the first civilian reactors in the world were used to supply heat as well as electricity. District heating using heat generated in reactors has been used in some cou ntries for \ndecades. Industrial process heating has also been used and there is potential for further \ndevelopment, but the extent to which nuclear reactors will be used for such applications will \ndepend on the economics of heat transport, international pres sure to reduce CO\n2 emissions and \nnational desires to reduce dependence on imported fossil fuels, as well as competition with alternative heat or combined heat and power (CHP) technologies (IAEA, 2019b).  \nThe prospect of using nuclear energy for desalination  on a large scale is attractive since \ndesalination is an energy intensive process that can make use of either the heat from a nuclear \nreactor and/or the electricity produced. About one -third of the world’s population lives in water -\nstressed areas, with a m ajority in Sub -Saharan Africa, the Middle East and South Asia, and with \nclimate change, access to fresh water could become increasingly challenging (IAEA, 2020). In recent years, several governments have been actively evaluating the possibility of using nu clear \nenergy for desalination (e.g.  China, Jordan, Libya and Qatar), building on experience gained \nthrough the operation of integrated nuclear desalination plants in India, Japan and Kazakhstan. \nThe advanced nuclear reactors that are under development as G eneration IV reactors will have \nhigher outlet temperatures and will thus be more suited to supplying heat for a larger range of \nindustrial processes.  \nCogeneration applications of nuclear energy are most likely to develop if nuclear cogeneration \nis more ec onomical than the technical solutions it replaces, essentially gas- fired production of \nsteam and electricity. Because of its large upfront capital costs and economies of scale, nuclear \nenergy might be appropriate (i.e.  competitive against fossil fuel applications) for significant \ncombined heat and electricity demand.

A solid understanding of the \neconomics of nuclear cogeneration, including the associated system costs, is therefore essential \n(NEA, 2022b).  \nEnergy use for transport, which is projected to continue t o grow rapidly over the coming \ndecades, is also a major source of greenhouse gas emissions. Both electric and hydrogen -fuelled \nvehicles are seen as potential replacements for those powered by fossil fuels. Nuclear energy \noffers baseload electricity product ion that could be used to power electric vehicles; it also has \nthe potential of producing hydrogen on a massive scale that could make this alternate energy \ncarrier available with significantly less greenhouse gas emissions compared to current methods \nof hy drogen production.  \nThere is increasing interest in SMRs in both established nuclear countries (e.g.  Argentina, \nCanada, the United States), and in newcomer countries in Europe, the Middle East, Africa and Southeast Asia. SMRs, with capacities generally in t he range of 30 -300 MWe, could be suitable for \nareas with small electrical grids and for deployment in remote locations. SMRs offer smaller \nupfront investment costs and reduced financial risks compared to larger reactors typically being \nbuilt today (1  000-1 700 MWe) and may be deployed as alternatives to larger nuclear power plants \nin locations where such plants cannot be built, or to fossil fuel- fired plants of similar sizes.  \nThe developments in design and technology, technical feasibility, the economic aspects and \nthe factors affecting the competitiveness of SMRs are described in various reports (NEA, 2021 a; \nIAEA, 2020a ; NEA, 2016). A large number of SMR designs are reported to be under different stages \nof development (more than 70 designs reported). Many are still at the conceptual design phase, \nwith some at the licensing phase and some already under construction (in Argentina and in China). \nRussia connected the world’s first floating nuclear power plant (KLT -40), Akademik Lomonosov, \nto the grid and starte d commercial operation in May 2020.  \nTechnological developments will be a factor in defining the long -term future of nuclear energy \nand of uranium demand. Advancements in reactor and fuel cycle technology are not only aimed at addressing economic, safety, security, non -proliferation and waste concerns, but also at \nincreasing the efficiency of uranium resource use. The introduction and use of advanced reactor \ndesigns and Generation IV designs would also permit the use of other types of nuclear fuels \n(e.g. fuels based on high assay low -enriched uranium, higher burn- ups, or other fuel compositions \nsuch as uranium -238 and thorium) that consume fissile resources more efficiently. In particular, \nfast neutron reactors are being developed to make more efficient use of the energy contained in \nuranium. Many national and several major international programmes are working to develop \nthese advanced technologies, for example the Generation  IV International Forum and the IAEA \nInternational Project on Innovative Nuclear Reac tors and Fuel Cycles. In the long term, new reactor \ndesigns may bring fundamental changes to the nuclear fuel landscape.  \n \nBox 2.2. Advancing High -Assay Low -Enriched Uranium (HALEU) supply  \nHigh assay low -enriched uranium (HALEU) continues to attract significant attention from global nuclear \nfuel cycle producers, utilities and governments. Many small modular reactors (SMRs) designers around the \nworld are indeed developing innovative reactor concepts that will require HALEU -based fuel. HALEU is \nenriched  between 5% and 20% and is being proposed for some advanced reactors and SMRs in order to \nallow for more compact cores, increased fuel cycle lengths, longer life cores and better fuel utili sation \noverall. The current commercial nuclear power reactors use u ranium fuel that is enriched up to 5%, a limit \nthat has become an industry standard and shaped the entire front end of the fuel cycle industry. The \ntransition to a HALEU fuel supply chain would however need a robust market for companies to commit the \ninves tments needed and will require fuel cycle infrastructure and regulation updates.  \n \nURANIUM DEMAND AND SUPPLY/DEMAND RELATIONSHIP  \nURANIUM 2022: RESOURCES, PRODUCTION AND DEMAND, NEA No. 7634, © OECD 2023  135 Today, Russia is the only country with an established HALEU  commercial  supply chain. Several countries are \nlooking to diversify HALEU fuel supply, including the United States . At the end of 2022, the US Department \nof Energy (DOE) established a HALEU consortium with the aim to pool together  entities across all the stages \nof the nuclear fuel cycle, to partner and  support the availability of HALEU for domestic commercial use. In \nparallel,  the DOE secured a contract with the enrichment company Centrus to demonstrate the production \nof HALEU at the Piketon facility by the end of 2023.  \nIn the short -term, potential recovery methods for HALEU include down -blending of government -owned \nhighly enriched uranium (HEU) stocks. As an example, the United States is working on chemical methods \nfor down -blending HEU to provide small amounts of HALEU to reactor developers in the near term in \nsupport of SMR demonstration projects.  \nConclusion \nAs rep orted in this volume, sufficient uranium resources exist to support continued use of \nnuclear power and significant growth in nuclear capacity for electricity generation and other \nuses (e.g.  heat, hydrogen production) in the long term. Considering current y early uranium \nrequirements of about 60 000 tU, identified recoverable resources,3 including reasonably \nassured resources and inferred resources, are sufficient for over 130  years. Exploitation of the \nentire conventional resource4 base would increase this t o around 250 years. Furthermore, \nuranium exploration and development, motivated by significantly increased demand and \nmarket prices, would be required to move these resources into more definitive economic cost categories. Nevertheless, a rapid growth of nu clear power in coming decades would significantly \nchange this picture. Uranium requirements that may arise from emerging applications of nuclear such as SMRs (including electric and potentially non -electric applications) will also need \nto be considered in these projections when better visibility of these novel applications allows for it.  \nThe uranium resource base described in this report is more than adequate to meet currently \nprojected growth requirements to 2040. As far as the availability of physical re sources is \nconcerned, there is no reason to assume major changes in this picture even beyond 2040. \nHowever, consumers and producers need to ensure that adequate framework conditions for the exploration, mining, transformation and transport of uranium are in place. This includes pricing mechanisms that allow for sufficient visibility in order to allow for the considerable long -term \ninvestments required  \nMeeting projected low case requirements to 2040 would consume about 20% of the identified \nrecoverable resou rces available at a cost of <USD  130/kgU and about 15% of identified \nrecoverable resources available at a cost of <USD  260/kgU. For the high case, meeting growth \nrequirements to 2040 would consume about 26% of identified recoverable resources available at a cost of <USD 130/kgU and about 20% of identified recoverable resources available at a cost of \n<USD  260/kgU.  It is worth noting that average uranium market prices beginning in mid -2021 \nand sustained through the beginning of 2023, were of around USD 130/kg U.  \nWhen considering lower cost resources, meeting projected requirements to 2040 would \nconsume about 60% of the identified resources available at a cost of <USD  80/kgU in the low \ncase scenario and about 80% of identified resources in the high demand case .  \n                                                      \n3.  Identified recoverable resources include all cost categories of reasonably assured resources and inferred \nresources for a total of about 7 917 500 tU (see Table  1.2a).  \n4.  Tota l conventional resources include all cost categories of reasonably assured, inferred, prognosticated \nand speculative resources for a total of more than 15 million tonnes (see Tables  1.3a, 1.4a and 1.13). This \ntotal does not include secondary sources or unconventional resources, e.g.  uranium from phosphate \nrocks.  \nURANIUM DEMAND AND SUPPLY/DEMAND RELATIONSHIP  \n136 URANIUM 2022: RESOURCES, PRODUCTI ON AND DEMAND, NEA No. 7634, © OECD 2023  Given the limited maturity and geographical coverage of uranium exploration worldwide, \nthere is considerable potential for the discovery of new resources of economic interest. As \nclearly demonstrated in the last few years, with appropriate market signal s, new uranium \nresources can be readily identified, developed and mined.  \nAs noted in this report, there are also considerable unconventional resources, including \nphosphate deposits and black schists/shales, which could be used to lengthen the time during \nwhich nuclear energy could supply energy demand using current technologies. However, more \nresearch and innovation effort and investment would need to be devoted to better define the \nextent of this potentially significant source of uranium and develop cost -effective extraction \ntechniques.  \nThe development and deployment of advanced reactor and fuel cycle technologies could \nfurther significantly add to and stretch global uranium supply in the long term. Moving to \nadvanced technology reactors and recycling fuel would increase the long -term availability of \nnuclear energy based on the fission of uranium from hundreds to potentially thousands of years . \nIf alternative fuel cycles were developed and successfully deployed, thorium could also be a \npotential contributor to the nuclear fuel cycle provided existing initial fissile inventories to start \nsuch thorium fuel cycles are readily available.  \nIn conclusion, sufficient physical uranium resources exist to meet demand from electricity \ngeneration at current and even at increased demand levels until 2040 and beyond. However, for these resources to be fully commercially available, considerable exploration and investment will be required to develop new mining projects in a timely manner and to generate sufficient supply to sa tisfy demand at reasonable prices.  \nReferences  \nEIA (2021), Uranium Marketing Annual Report 2021, EIA, Washington, D C, www.eia.gov/uranium/  \nmarketing .  \nEIA (2020), Uranium Marketing Annual Report 2020, EIA, Washington, DC , www.eia.gov/uranium/  \nmarketing . \nEIA (2019), Uranium Marketing Annual Report 2019, EIA, Washington, DC, www.eia.gov/uranium/  \nmarketing . \nESA (2021), Annual  Report 2021, ESA, Luxembourg, https://euratom -supply.ec.europa.eu/  \npublications/esa -annual -reports_en . \nESA (2020), Annual Report 2020, ESA, Luxembourg, https://euratom -supply.ec.europa.eu/  \npublications/esa -annual -reports_en .   \nESA (2019), Annual Report 2018, ESA, Luxembourg , https://euratom -supply.ec.europa.eu/  \npublications/esa -annual -reports_en .   \nESA (2011), Annual Report 2010, ESA, Luxembourg, https ://euratom -supply.ec.europa.eu/  \npublications/esa -annual -reports_en .   \nIAEA (2022), Energy, Electricity and Nuclear Power Estimates for the Period up to 2050, RDS -1 2022 \nedition, IAEA, Vienna, www.iaea.org/publications/15268/energy -electricity -and-nuclear -\npower -estimates -for-the-period -up-to-2050.  \nIAEA (2021a), Energy, Electricity and Nuclear Power Estimates for the Period up to 2050 , RDS-1 2021 \nedition, IAEA, Vienna, www.iaea.org/publications/15028/energy -electricity -and-nuclear -\npower -estimates -for-the-period-up-to-2050.  \nIAEA (2021b),  Nuclear Power Reac tors in the World, IAEA, Vienna, www.iaea.org/publications/  \n14989/nuclear -power -reactors -in-the-world   \nIAEA (2020a),  Advances in Small Modular Reactor Technology Developments, 2020 edition, IAEA, \nVienna, https://aris.iaea.org/Publications/SMR_Book_2020.pdf .  \nURANIUM DEMAND AND SUPPLY/DEMAND RELATIONSHIP  \nURANIUM 2022: RESOURCES, PRODUCTION AND DEMAND, NEA No. 7634, © OECD 2023  137 IAEA (2020b), World Energy Availability Factors by Year (database), Power Reactor Information \nSystem (PRIS), www.iaea.org/pris . \nIAEA (2020c), Climate Change and Nuclear Power 2020, IAEA, Vienna, www.iaea.org/publications/  \n14725/climate- change -and-nuclear -power -2020.  \nIAEA (2019a), Energy, Electricity and Nuclear Power Estimates for the Period up to 2050 , RDS-1 2019 \nedition, I AEA, Vienna, www.iaea.org/publications/13591/energy -electricity -and-nuclear -\npower -estimates -for-the-period -up-to-2050.  \nIAEA (20 19b), Guidance on Nuclear Energy Cogeneration , 2019, IAEA, Vienna, www.iaea.org/  \npublications/13385/guidance -on-nuclear -energy -cogeneration .  \nIEA (2022 ), Nuclear  Powe r and Secure Energy Transitions, IEA , Paris , www.iea.org/reports/nuclear -\npower -and-secure -energy -transitions . \nIEA (2021a ), World Energy Outlook , IEA , Paris, www.iea.org/reports/world -energy -outlook -2021.  \nIEA (2021b ), Net Zero by 2050:  A Roadmap for th e Global Energy Sector , IEA , Paris , www.iea.org/  \nreports/net -zero -by-2050.  \nIEA (2020), World Energy Outlook: 2020 , IEA, Paris, www.iea.org/reports/world -energy -outlook -2020.  \nIEA (2019), Nuclear Power in a Clean Energy System , IEA, Paris , www.iea.org/reports/nuclear -power -\nin-a-clean -energy -system . \nIEA (2017), World Energy Investment 2017 , IEA, Paris , www.iea.org/reports/world- energy -\ninvestment -2017.  \nNEA  (2022),  Meeting Climate Change Targe ts.

National reports on uranium exploration, resources, \nproduction, demand and the environment  \nIntroduction  \nThis chapter presents the national submissions on uranium exploration, resources and \nproduction. These reports have been provided by official government organisations (see \nAppendix  1) responsible for the control of nuclear raw materials in their respective countries, \nalthough the details are the responsibility of the individual organisations concerned. In countries where commercial companies ar e engaged in exploration, mining and production of uranium, the \ninformation is first submitted by these companies to the government of the host country and may \nthen be transmitted to the NEA or the IAEA at the discretion of the government concerned. In \ncertain cases, where an official national report was not submitted, and where it was deemed \nhelpful for the reader, the NEA/IAEA has provided additional comments or estimates to complete this report. In such cases, “NEA/IAEA estimates” are clearly indicated.  \nIt should be noted that exploration activities may be currently ongoing in a number of other \ncountries that are not included in this report. In addition, uranium resources may have been identified in some of these countries. It is believed, however, that t he total of these resources \nwould not significantly affect the overall conclusions of this report. Nevertheless, the NEA and IAEA encourage the governments of these countries to submit an official response to the questionnaire for the next edition of the R ed Book.  \nAdditional information on the world’s uranium deposits is available in the IAEA online \ndatabase World Distribution of Uranium Deposits –  UDEPO (www- nfcis.iaea.org). UDEPO contains \ninformation on location, ranges of uranium tonnage and average grad e, geological type, status, \noperating organisations (in case the deposit is being mined), and other technical and geological details about the deposits.  \nThirty -six member countries submitted a response to the questionnaire and the NEA/IAEA \ndrafted 18 country reports. As a result, there are a total of 54 national reports in the following \nsection.  \n \nNATIONAL REPORTS : ALGERIA  \n140 URA NIUM 202 2: RESOURCES, PRODUCTION AND DEMAND, NEA No. 7634, © OECD 202 3 Algeria  \nUranium exploration and mine development  \nHistorical review  \nOver the last forty years, uranium prospecting in Algeria, which began with the launch of a \nmineral prospecting programme in the Hoggar region, underwent a first stage (1969- 1973) marked \nby a significant investment effort which led to the discovery of the first uranium deposits in the Hoggar Precambrian crystalline basement (Timgaouine -Abankor -Tinef). \nThese results, obtained through ground radiometric surveys and geological mapping, \nquickly identified the uranium resource potential of the Hoggar region, which overall has favourable geological and metallogenic characteristics for mineral deposits.  \nAn aeromagnetic -spectrometric survey of the entire country, carried out in 1971, provided the \ninitial incentive and direction for uranium exploration. The processing of the data collected from \nthis survey identified potential regions for further uranium prospecting, including the Eglab, \nOuggarta, and Tin Seririne sedimentary basins (Southern Tassili where the Tahaggart deposit was discovered), as well as individual areas in Tamart -n-Iblis and Timouzeline.  \nWhile these developments were taking place, uranium p rospecting entered a new phase \n(1973- 1981) primarily aimed and focused on the assessment of uranium reserves and the \ndevelopment of previously discovered deposits.  \nDespite a pronounced slowdown in prospecting activities in the phase that followed  (1984-\n1997), work undertaken in the immediate vicinity of previously discovered deposits and in other promising areas revealed indications of uranium mineralisation and radiometric anomalies in the Amel and Tesnou zones located to the northwest and north respective ly of the Timgaouine region.  \nSurveys conducted in the Tin Seririne Basin (Tassili South Hoggar), provided a basis on which \nto undertake geologic mapping and revealed the distribution of uranium -bearing minerals in \nPalaeozoic sedimentary formations.  \nRecent and ongoing uranium exploration and mine development activities  \nIn 2017 and 2018, the Agency of the Geological Service of Algeria in collaboration with the United States Geological Survey carried out preliminary prospecting work for undiscovered mineral resources (diamond, Au, PGE -Cr, Cu -Ni-PGE-Cr and Mo -Cu) in the Eglabs region, including \nuranium resources related to granites, calcretes, alkaline rocks and carbonatites.  \nNo uranium prospecting or mine development work was carried out between January 2019 \nand January 2021. All prospecting programmes were placed on hold, largely due to the COVID -19 \npandemic.  \nUranium resources  \nIdentified conventional resources (reasonably assured and inferred resources)  \nThere are two geological types of reasonably assured resou rces in Algeria: upper Proterozoic \nvein deposits in the western Hoggar, and a deposit linked to the Precambrian basement and its Palaeozoic sedimentary unconformity in the central Hoggar. The first type includes vein \n NATIONAL REPORTS : ALGERIA  \nURANIUM 202 2: RESOURCES, PRODUCTION AND DEMAND, NEA No. 7634, ©  OECD 20 23 141 deposits linked to faults crossing the Pan -African batholith in the Timgaouine region, \nrepresented by the Timgaouine, Abankor and Tinef deposits in the south -western Ahaggar.  \nThe second type is unconformity -related, represented by the Tahaggart deposit. It is \nassociated with a weathering profil e (regolith) developed at the interface between the \nPrecambrian basement and the Palaeozoic cover, and to conglomerates at the base of the \nPalaeozoic sedimentary sequence in the Tin Seririne Basin (south -east of Hoggar). It is worth \nnoting that the uranium mineralisation discovered in the Ait Oklan -El Bema (north Hoggar) \nregion has not been assessed in terms of uranium resources.  \nUndiscovered conventional resources (prognosticated and speculative resources)  \nAlgeria does not report any resources in any categ ory other than reasonably assured resources.  \nUranium production  \nHistorical review  \nAlgeria does not produce uranium.  \nRegulatory regime  \nMining activities related to raw materials for nuclear energy, and environmental protection \naspects to be taken into accou nt for such activities are governed, among others, by:  \n• Law No. 03 -10 of 19 July 2003 on the protection of the environment for sustainable \ndevelopment;  \n• Law No. 14- 05 of 24 February 2014 relating to mining activities;  \n• Law No. 19- 05 of 17 July 2019 on nuclear  activities.  \nAlgeria decided to regulate activities related to the research, production and peaceful use of \nnuclear energy with the adoption of Law No. 19- 05 of 17 July 2019 on nuclear activities.  \nThe law sets objectives such as the protection of human hea lth, the environment and future \ngenerations against potentially harmful effects related to the use of ionising radiation, while respecting the principles of radiological protection and nuclear safety and secur ity, in compliance \nwith Algeria’ s commitments u nder international treaties and conventions. It applies to activities \nrelated to nuclear materials and ionising radiation sources, nuclear and radiological installations, radioactive waste, and uranium and thorium ores.  \nThe measures to be put in place by o perators, importers, transporters, and holders of \nradioactive materials to achieve these objectives, including exposure limits, accident prevention measures, or systems to control access to facilities or to combat illicit trafficking in nuclear materials, will be set by regulation.  \nIn application of this law, the National Authority for Nuclear Safety and Security was created \nunder the supervision of the Prime Minister by executive decree (No 21- 148 of 20 April 2021). This \nindependent administrative authorit y, which has legal personality and financial autonomy, is \ncompetent, in particular, to draft legislation and regulations relating to nuclear activities and guides of good practice to ensure the safety and security of operations and ensure their application . \nIts prerogatives also include the issuance of authorisations and licences, the control of \ninstallations, the approval of training programmes, the approval and management of emergency \nplans, and co -operation with international and regional organisations.  \nPending the establishment of the authority, the Atomic Energy Commission (COMENA) \nexercises its prerogatives.  \nNATIONAL REPORTS : ALGERIA  \n142 URA NIUM 202 2: RESOURCES, PRODUCTION AND DEMAND, NEA No. 7634, © OECD 202 3 National policies related to uranium  \nFrom a mining perspective, in a world market dominated in the short - and medium -term by a \nsmall number of pr oducers, it is currently not economically feasible to exploit uranium \nresources in Algeria.  \nAlgeria’ s uranium resources can only be exploited in a sustainable manner within the \nframework of an integrated development of the nuclear sector and its main applications. The \nlatter include, in particular, nuclear power generation and seawater desalination plants, \ntogether with applications in medicine, agriculture, water resources and industry.  \nWith regard to the current situation in the global energy market, Alge ria is working towards \nthe integrated development of the uranium sector, ranging from exploration to production and \nencompassing research and development, training, and long -term nuclear power generation \nprospects.  \nGaining control over the uranium producti on cycle and its applications would require the \nacquisition of technical expertise, which can only be achieved through ambitious research, \ndevelopment and training programmes. Through its nuclear research centres, Algeria currently \nhas the appropriate tools to undertake work in the future, either alone or through bilateral or \nmultilateral co- operation on various research, development and training programmes.  \nIt is in a spirit of openness and transparency that Algeria applied itself to the task of putting \nin place the most favourable and appropriate institutional and regulatory framework with \nwhich to pursue the energy development of the country, including a Mining Act, Environmental \nProtection Act, an Oil and Gas Act and recently a civil nuclear activities A ct. The latter \nestablishes the regulatory framework for mining activities relating to radioactive minerals, from exploration to mine rehabilitation, including the management of radioactive mining waste.  \nTo improve the mining sector and boost research, exp loration and exploitation, the \ngovernment amended Law 01- 10 (of 3 July 2001) by promulgating Law 14- 05 on 24 February 2014. \nThis mining law aims to create better conditions for the revival of the sector through adequate \nfunding for research and exploration  of new economically viable mining deposits, including \nuranium.  \nUranium stocks  \nNone.  \nReasonably assured conventional resources by production method  \n(in situ tonnes  U) \nProduction method  <USD 40/kgU  <USD 80/kgU  <USD 130/kgU  <USD 260/kgU  \nUnspecified  0 0 0 26 000 \nTotal  0 0 0 26 000  \nReasonably assured conventional resources by processing method  \n(in situ tonnes  U) \nProcessing method  <USD 40/kgU  <USD 80/kgU  <USD 130/kgU  <USD 260/kgU  \nUnspecified  0 0 0 26 000  \nTotal  0 0 0 26 000  \n \n NATIONAL REPORTS : ALGERIA  \nURANIUM 202 2: RESOURCES, PRODUCTION AND DEMAND, NEA No. 7634, ©  OECD 20 23 143 Reasonably assured conventional resources by deposit type  \n(in situ tonnes  U) \nDeposit type  <USD 40/kgU  <USD 80/kgU  <USD 130/kgU  <USD 260/kgU  \nProterozoic unconformity     2 000  \nGranite -related     24 000  \nTotal     26 000  \nInstalled nuclear generating capacity to 2040  \n(MWe net)  \n2017 2018 2020 2025 2030 2035 2040 \n0 0 Low  High  Low  High  Low  High  Low  High  Low  High  \n0 0 NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA \n \nNATIONAL REPORTS : ARGENTINA  \n144 URA NIUM 202 2: RESOURCES, PRODUCTION AND DEMAND, NEA No. 7634, © OECD 202 3 Argentina  \nUranium exploration and mine development  \nHistorical review  \nUranium exploration activities in Argentina were launched in 1951 -1952 by the Na tional Atomic \nEnergy Commission (CNEA), leading to the discovery of the Papagayos, Huemul, Don Otto and \nLos Berthos uranium deposits. During the late 1950s and the early 1960s, airborne surveys also led to the discovery of the Los Adobes sandstone -type deposits in Patagonia.  \nDuring the 1960s, the Schlagintweit and La Estela granite -related deposits were discovered \nand subsequently mined. During the 1970s, follow -up exploration near the previously discovered \nuranium occurrences in Patagonia led to the discov ery of two new sandstone deposits: Cerro \nCondor and Cerro Solo. At the end of the 1980s, a nationwide exploration programme was undertaken to evaluate geological units with uranium potential.  \nFrom 1990 to 1997, exploration was conducted in the vicinity of the Cerro Solo deposit (Chubut \nProvince), where more than 56  000 m were drilled to test the potential of favourable portions of \nthe paleochannel structure. The results included the localisation and partial evaluation of specific mineralised bodies with 4  600 tU of reasonably assured and inferred resources.  \nThese results allowed the CNEA to complete a preliminary economic assessment of the Cerro \nSolo U -Mo deposit in 1997, including a revised geological model and ore resource estimates, \nmining and milling met hods and costs, cash flow and risk analysis, as well as the exploration and \nevaluation of the surrounding areas.  \nAs a result of the national government’s policy announced in August 2006 to reactivate the \nnuclear programme, different areas of uranium inter est have been explore and evaluated.  \nFrom 2007 to 2016, a total of 45 672 m was drilled (across 380 boreholes) in the main \nmineralised areas of the Cerro Solo district, while in the Cerro Solo U deposit, a total of 44 246  m \nwas drilled (373 boreholes) to further stratigraphic correlation and metallogenic studies, \nmineralogical and hydrometallurgical studies, and triaxial strength.  \nOther areas under study in Chubut Province were the Sierra Cuadrada Uranium district, \nwhere at least four uranium mineralised areas were recognised. In this district, a regional \ngeological survey was carried out in an area of 4  000 ha with geological– radiometric data \ncollection and four drill holes accounting for total drilling of 585 m.  \nFluvial and lacustrine deposits of Cretac eous age  discoveries were made at the Mirasol Chico \nsite, where a drilling programme of 507 m (3 holes) was completed in 2015, and at the El Cruce \nsite, where radiometric prospecting works and 647 m of drilling were undertaken.  \nIn Santa Cruz Province, the  main exploration work was focused on shallow low -grade \nuranium anomalies in six areas defined as a surficial deposit (calcrete type), and in the Laguna Sirven area the focus was on defining the extension and continuity of uranium mineralisation. \nMining pr operties are shared by FOMICRUZ S.E. and the CNEA.  \nIn the Urcal and Urcuschun deposits, located in La Rioja Province, uranium mineralisation \nis associated with limestone deposits from the Ordovician age to sedimentary sequences from \nthe Carboniferous -Permi an age. Exploration activities included re -examination of old mining \nactivities, geological studies, geophysical exploration and the implementation of a drilling \nprogramme of 993 m (13 drilled holes) in 2015.  \n NATIONAL REPORTS : ARGENTINA  \nURANIUM 202 2: RESOURCES, PRODUCTION AND DEMAND, NEA No. 7634, ©  OECD 20 23 145 Systematic geochemical studies and geophysical exploration were carried out at the Alipán \nI site (perigranitic deposit) in the Velasco Range of La Rioja Prov ince. Between 2010 and 2013, \n14 drillings were executed for a total of 2 344 m. Over the eastern side of the Velasco Range, a \nnew area of explorat ion called Lucero has been studied with encouraging results, and three \nzones with anomalies and evidence of surface uranium minerals were defined.  \nAt the U Mina Franca perigranitic deposit, located in the Fiambalá Range, Catamarca \nProvince, surface systematic radiometric surveys, geological -structural -metallogenic mapping, \nmineralogical studies and geochemical analyses have been undertaken. In 2017, surface \ngeological reconnaissance activities were completed, which provided the structural geological \nbase ma p used to plan a drill programme to define mineralisation at depth.  \nGeophysical techniques were applied to study mineralisation behaviour in detail in the \nnorth and central sectors of the Don Otto deposit (Cretaceous -aged sandstone type), Salta \nProvince. O ther activities conducted in the district included geomorphological studies and \nidentification of the geological setting. These works were complemented with a dri lling \nprogramme totalling 1  734 m (8 holes).  \nEvidence of uranium mineralisation found in oil w ells and, to a lesser extent, known from \nsurface data, have been under analysis in two exploration areas near Catriel town, Río Negro \nProvince. Mineralisation is related to sandstone deposits within the Neuquén Basin. Geophysical \nexploration was undertaken  during 2015 and 2016, complemented with geochemical exploration, \ngeological radiometric reconnaissance and a drilling programme of 1  910 m distributed across  \n10 boreholes.  \nSome semi -regional geological recognition activities, including geochemical survey s and \ngeophysical studies, were conducted in an exploration area in Gobernador Ayala, La Pampa \nProvince, and a drilling programme was planned.  \nIn the early 2000s, six private uranium exploration companies began work in Argentina as \nnoted by the Cámara Arge ntina de Empresas de Uranio  (CADEU – Argentine Chamber of Uranium \nCompanies): U3O8 Corp. (Meseta Exploraciones S.A.  - MEXSA; Calypso Uranium Corp. merged \nwith U3O8 Corp.); Sophia Energy S.A.; Blue Sky Uranium Corp.  (Minera Cielo Azul S.A.); Cauldron \nMinera ls Ltd; Gaia Energy Argentina S.A. and UrAmerica Ltd. Of these private companies, U3O8 \nCorp., Sophia Energy S.A., UrAmerica Ltd and Blue Sky Uranium Corp. continue with their work in Argentina.  \nThe Laguna Salada U deposit (Chubut Province) held by MEXSA, a subsidiary of U3O8 Corp., is \na surficial uranium -vanadium deposit and includes the Guanaco and Lago Seco areas with 82% \nand 12% of the resources, respectively. Mineralisation occurs within 3 m of the surface in soft, unconsolidated gravel. Indicated and inferred in situ resources have been evaluated at 2 420 tU \nand 1 460 tU, respectively, while vanadium identified resources have been assessed at 21 330 tV. \nThe NI 43- 101 report, including exploration results, resource evaluation and the preliminary \neconomic assessment, was issued in 2014. Since then, however, the project has been on hold.  \nSophia Energy S.A. carried out the exploration of its calcrete -type vanadium -uranium \ndeposit at the Laguna Sirven site in Santa Cruz Province. Geochemical and biogeochemi cal \nsurveys and hyperspectral and thermal remote sensing studies were performed in order to \nspectrally characterise and determine mineralised areas of interest. Trenching and sampling was also carried out.  \nUrAmerica Ltd undertook an intensive underground exploration programme supported by \ndrilling 250 holes, for a total of approximately 24  000 m, on neighbouring areas of the Cerro \nSolo ore deposit, in Chubut Province. They report 7  350 tU as inferred in situ resources for the \nMeseta -Central project. As rep orted by UrAmerica, about 75% of the uranium resources \nevaluated are in confined aquifers. Therefore, further geological and hydrological studies will \nbe needed to determine if it is suitable for in situ leach mining. The NI 43- 101 report included \nexplorat ion results and an inferred resource assessment and was issued in 2013. In the same \nyear the project was put in care and maintenance.  \nBlue Sky Uranium Corp has been actively exploring its Amarillo Grande Project in central Río \nNegro Province since 2006. Defined mineralisation at Amarillo Grande is found in three target \nareas (Ivana, Anit, and Santa Barbara) along a 145 km trend. Mineralisation at all three areas occurs \nNATIONAL REPORTS : ARGENTINA  \n146 URA NIUM 202 2: RESOURCES, PRODUCTION AND DEMAND, NEA No. 7634, © OECD 202 3 at or very near surface in unconsolidated to weakly- cemented host rocks. Surface explorat ion, \nground geophysics, pit sampling and more than 9 000 m of reverse circulation drilling were \ncompleted at the project since the beginning of the revitalised work programme in 2016.  \nRecent and ongoing uranium exploration and mine development activities  \nAs of 2021, the CNEA owns 50 exploration licences in Argentina, considering requested and \nconceded exploration permit areas (22), statements of discovery (18), and ore deposits (10). They \nare located within the provinces of Salta, Catamarca, La Rioja, San Juan, Mendoza, La Pampa, \nRío Negro, Chubut and Santa Cruz.  \nFrom 2017 to 2019, exploration activities carried out by the government have slowed down \nand no drilling has been carried out. The main areas that have been targeted by the CNEA for \nuranium explor ation belong to Cañadon Asfalto Basin (Chubut Province), Neuquén Basin (Río \nNegro and La Pampa Provinces), Velasco Range (La Rioja Province), Fiambalá Range (Catamarca \nProvince) and Salta Group Basin (Salta Province). In general, the activities have been f ocused on \nsome field work for geological and radiometric reviews, geophysical surveys, sampling for \ngeochemical analysis and environmental studies.  \nOf those uranium deposits managed by the CNEA, the most relevant in the assessment/  \nexploration stage is Ce rro Solo, which belongs to the homonymous district and is located in \nChubut Province. Identified uranium resources of the Cerro Solo deposit total 9 230 tU. To define \nthe hydrometallurgical extraction line of uranium and molybdenum minerals, laboratory -scale \nsample testing has been completed, but further up -scale testing was postponed. Since 2018, only \nenvironmental monitoring has been carried out.  \nFrom 2012 to 2019, one of the main activities at the Cerro Solo ore deposit was related to \nenvironmental basel ine surveying in compliance with provincial regulations. In this regard, \nhydrological, palaeontological, socio- economic, air quality, flora and fauna, pedological and \narchaeological studies have been completed, while radiometric/radiological and natural ac idic \ndrainage surveys are being developed.  \nIn the framework of an IAEA Coordinated Research Project on “Geochemical and \nMineralogical Characterisation of Uranium and Thorium Deposits”, the interpretation of new studies on uranium mineralisation from sever al uranium sites of interest has improved the \nmetallogenetic understanding of the granite -related deposits and the exploration guidelines.  \nDue to the COVID -19 pandemic, during 2020 and the first half of 2021, cabinet uranium \nexploration activities were car ried out, consisting of: data collection, processing, and \ninterpretation; writing of technical reports; dissemination, training and teaching activities. \nLimited laboratory activities were carried out, which included preparation, studies and analysis of geo logical samples. At the same time, maintenance and servicing tasks of facilities, vehicles \nand technical equipment were fulfilled, as well as the administrative, legal, and environmental commitments corresponding to the various projects and sites. Field ta sks were very limited and \nreduced to two geological commissions carried out in the Northwest of the country.  \nGovernment exploration activities were expected to intensify in the second half of 2021, \nwhich included a programme of 1  200 metre drillings (6 dri lled holes) in the Neuquén Basin, but \nthe task was postponed until 2022.  \nSophia Energy S.A., UrAmerica Ltd, Blue Sky Uranium Corp., U3O8 Corp. and Consolidated \nUranium Inc. reported exploration- related activities during the 2017- 2021 period. Sophia Energy \nS.A. continued exploration of its mining properties at the Laguna Sirven deposit in Santa Cruz Province. Activities include processing satellite imagery, geological mapping, ground and airborne \nradiometric surveys, and geochemical and geobotanical sampling  and analyses, a portion of which \nwas carried out in co- operation with the University of Surrey (United Kingdom). In 2018, a \nradiometric airborne survey of the entire project (600 km\n2) was carried out under contract by the \nNational Atomic Energy Commission . All these exploration efforts brought encouraging results. In \nDecember 2019, Sophia Energy S.A. received approval from the province of Santa Cruz Mining \nAuthorities to perform an intensive two- year advanced exploration programme focused on \nresource asses sment, but the COVID -19 pandemic caused exploration activities to be put on hold \nsince early 2021.  \n NATIONAL REPORTS : ARGENTINA  \nURANIUM 202 2: RESOURCES, PRODUCTION AND DEMAND, NEA No. 7634, ©  OECD 20 23 147 In 2020, the memorandum of understanding signed in 2018 among UrAmerica Ltd, Uranium \nOne Group from Russia, UrAmerica Argentina and the Government of Argenti na, expired. The \nmain purpose of that MOU was to promote co -operation and the joint development of uranium \nexploration and production focused on ISL, with planned investment amounting to \nUSD  250 million. UrAmerica Ltd plans to set up a subsidiary company b ased in the United States, \nwhich among other goals, would provide uranium exploration investments for its Argentinian \nuranium projects.   \nIn 2019, Blue Sky Uranium Corp. announced the first preliminary economic assessment for \nthe Ivana deposit (Amarillo Grande project), as well as an updated resource estimate. The \ninferred in situ resource estimate includes 8 730 tU at 0.031% U and 2 920 tV at 0.011% V. Exploration in 2019 continued to focus on expanding the mineralisation proximal to the Ivana deposit. The first half of the year included additional pit and auger sampling, with a 6  km-long \ninduced polarisation (“IP” ) geophysical survey and up to 4 500 m of RC drilling planned for the \nsecond half of the year. The drilling programme was launched in Q1 2020 but immediately halted due to the COVID -19 pandemic, then resumed in Q1 2021.  \nIn June 2021, U3O8 Corp. announced that International Consolidated Uranium Inc. had been \nchosen to exercise its option to purchase the Laguna Salada project (Chubut Province) from U3O8 Corp. The terms of the option agreement were outlined in U3O8 Corp.’s press release dated \n14 December 2020. In December 2021, International Consolidated Uranium closed its option to \nacquire the Laguna Salada uranium and vanadium project. This project has been in care and \nmaintenance since 2014, but it is expected that exploration activities will be resumed in the \nshort term.  \nThe information about private exploration expenditures must be taken as only partially \ncomplete since the industry is not required to report these expenditures to the government.  \nUranium resources  \nIdentified conventional resources (reasonably assured and inferred resources)  \nNo new reasonably assured and inferred resources have been assessed since the last Red Book edition (2020). Chan ges observed in figures are due to recalculation to convert in situ into \nrecoverable resources and re -assignment of mining and processing methods taking into \nconsideration available NI 43 -101 reports  and CNEA internal documents.  \nIdentified recoverable uran ium resources (RAR+IR) in Argentina  \n(as of 1 January 2021)  \nDeposit  \n(ownership) Province  Type  RAR tU  \n≤ USD 130/kgU  IR tU  \n≤ USD 130/kgU  \nSierra Pintada  (CNEA)  Mendoza  Volcanic -related  3 900  6 110  \nCerro Solo  (CNEA)  Chubut  Sandstone  4 420  3 760 (4 810)* \nDon Otto  (CNEA)  Salta Sandstone  180 250 \nLaguna Colorada (CNEA)  Chubut  Volcanic -related  100 60 \nLaguna S alada  (Consolidated Uranium Inc. )  Chubut  Surficial  1 860  1 120  \nMeseta Central  (UrAmerica Ltd)  Chubut  Sandstone  - 5 290  \nIvana/Amarillo Grande (Blue Sky U Corp.)

It can be highlighted that if the highest production cost \ncategory of <260 USD/kgU is considered, there is no substantial variation and total recoverable \nidentified resources amount to 35 300 tU.  \nUndisco vered conventional resources (prognosticated and speculative resources)  \nThe 13 800 tU prognosticated resources reported in the Red Book 2020 corresponded to five \nsandstone -type deposits in the Cerro Solo and Sierra Cuadrada uranium districts of Chubut \nProvince (Cerro Solo, El Ganso, Puesto Alvear, El Molino, Sierra Cuadrada Norte and Arroyo Perdido).   \nAs a result of recent interpretation of direct and indirect data, an additional 6 900 tU of \nprognosticated resources have been evaluated at the Catriel (6 000 tU; sandstone type; Río Negro \nProvince), El Gallo (600 tU; intrusive type; La Rioja Province) and Laguna Sirven (300 tU; surficial \ntype; Santa Cruz Province) deposits. Therefore, total prognosticated in situ resources account \nfor 20 700 tU in the <USD 260 /kgU cost category.  \nTo assess the uranium favourability and estimate the potential resources by the application \nof quantitative McCammon and Deposit Size Frequency (DSF) methods, also used in the US National Uranium Resource Evaluation (NURE) programme, th e country was divided into \n61 investigation units (IU). These units, which cover 1  450 000 km\n2, were delineated on the basis \nof the geotectonic setting as well as petrological, mineralogical and geochemical characteristics. \nSpeculative uranium in situ resources amount to 79 500 tU according to the resource assessment \nthat has been completed in 5  IUs considered as the units with high uranium potential (i.e.  Salta \nGroup Basin, Pampean Ranges, Paganzo Basin, San Rafael Basin and Chubut Group Basin). \nSandstone,  volcanic -related and granite -related uranium deposit types have been taken into \nconsideration in this approach.  \nIn addition, qualitative methodologies based on spatial modelling and mineral system \nconcepts have been applied to determine uranium exploratio n targets. The geological units under \nstudy are: the Salta Group Basin (sandstone type; Salta province), Pipanaco Salt Flats/Aimogasta \nBasin (surficial type; Catamarca and La Rioja Provinces), Paganzo Basin (sandstone type; \nCatamarca and La Rioja Provinces ), Western Precordillera and Western Flank of the Pie de Palo \nRange (sandstone and surficial types; San Juan Province), Ambargasta Salt Flats (surficial type; Santiago del Estero Province), Sumampa Ranges (granite -related type; Santiago del Estero \nProvince ), Deseado Massif and related areas (sandstone and surficial types; Santa Cruz Province). \nOther prospective studies have been conducted, notably related to uranium from phosphates (unconventional resources). In the framework of an IAEA Coordinated Research Project, \npreliminary studies are underway for the assessment of the uranium potential of phosphate rocks \nand testing uranium extraction from low -grade phosphate ores. The research project involves \nstudies in three sedimentary basins (Ordovician North -West ern Basin, Upper Jurassic –  Lower \nCretaceous Neuquén Basin, and Paleocene –  Miocene Patagonia Basin), where low -grade \nphosphate mineralisation and uranium anomalies (up to 135 ppm U) have been detected.   \nUranium production  \nHistorical review  \nArgentina produ ced uranium from the mid -1950s until 1999 with a total of seven commercial -\nscale production centres and a pilot plant that operated between 1953 and 1970. The closure of \none of the last of these facilities in 1995 (Los Colorados) resulted in a change in th e ownership \nstructure of uranium production in Argentina, and since 1996 the uranium mining industry has been wholly owned by the CNEA. The last facility that remained operative at that time, San \nRafael, was placed on standby in 1997. No uranium has been p roduced since then, neither \nprivately nor by state. Between the mid -1950s and 1997, cumulative uranium production \ntotalled 2  582 tU. \n NATIONAL REPORTS : ARGENTINA  \nURANIUM 202 2: RESOURCES, PRODUCTION AND DEMAND, NEA No. 7634, ©  OECD 20 23 149 Status of production facilities, production capability, recent and ongoing activities and \nother issues  \nProduction projects  \nArgentina produced about 120 tU/year for about 20 years to provide raw material to fuel its nuclear \npower plants Atucha I and Embalse, with ore from different sites distributed throughout the \nnational territory. In the late 1990s, the decline in the international price of uranium made \ndomestic production no longer competitive and the decision was taken to shut down the \nremaining production plants and import uranium. However, changes in recent years have caused \nthe CNEA to review its plans and consider reope ning production facilities. These changes are the \nuncertainties in future external supply and the increase in domestic uranium requirements upon the full capacity operation of the Atucha II reactor, which was reached in 2015. In addition, \nEmbalse was out of the generation system for three years for successful refurbishment to extend \nits operational life by 30 years and increase its power by an additional 35 MWe. With an installed nuclear capacity of 1.79 GWe, natural uranium requirements are about 220 tU pe r year. The \npotential addition of one new PWR -1150 and the development of the CAREM -25 prototype and \nCAREM -120 commercial reactors will further increase domestic uranium requirements, which \ncould reach approximately 480 tU/year by 2030.  \nThe San Rafael Mini ng-Milling Complex (CMFSR) Remediation and Reactivation Project  \nOnce the CNEA evaluated the possibility of reopening the production facilities of the San Rafael mining -milling complex (Sierra Pintada mine), an environmental impact assessment (EIA -2004, \naccording to provincial Act 5961) was presented to the authorities in the province of Mendoza and \nto the Nuclear Regulatory Authority. This study evaluated the potential impacts of uranium \nconcentrate and dioxide production and the treatment of the former was tes simultaneously.  \nThis EIA concluded that former operations had not affected the quality of underground and \nsurface waters in the area, or any other environmental component in the surrounding area. \nProvincial authorities nonetheless rejected the reopenin g proposal, arguing that the CNEA must \nfirst remediate the open -pit water and the milling wastes stored in drums before restarting \nproduction. In response, the CNEA prepared and submitted a new EIA (2006) addressing only the treatment of wastes in temporar y storage and pit water. This proposal received technical \napproval, but not final approval because it lacked the required statutory public hearing. \nA further complication that increased the difficulty of reopening the plant was the approval of \nMendoza Provincial Act 7722 (2007), which prohibits the use of sulphuric acid, among other \nchemicals, in mining activities.  \nCurrently, the CNEA is constructing evaporation ponds and defining the basic engineering \nfor the simultaneous treatment of open -pit water and mi lling wastes stored at the San Rafael \ncomplex. To date, three effluent evaporation ponds have been finished and one more is under \nconstruction. In 2018, the update of the EIA 2006 (EIA, 2013) presented to the provincial control \nauthorities reached a favour able technical opinion and a mandatory public hearing by law was \nheld in 2019 with positive outcomes. Therefore, the provincial authorities granted the \nenvironmental impact statement through Resolution N° 259/19.  \nThe CNEA secured sufficient funds for the r ehabilitation works of former uranium production \nfacilities from the Bank for Investment Projects in the Ministry of Economy. Having an approved \nbudget means that more time and resources can be devoted to addressing the remediation and \nrehabilitation works. These activities involve the removal of obsolete facilities, construction of \neffluent ponds, purchase of equipment and facilities, and other associated activities.  \nBefore restarting uranium production in San Rafael, it is necessary to obtain both provin cial \napproval and agreement to amend the provincial law that prevents the use of sulphuric acid, \namong other chemicals. Technical feasibility has been partially demonstrated by the fact that \nthis deposit was previously in operation, using the acid heap -leach processing method. Other \nalternatives have been considered for possible future production, including the use of alkaline \nleaching, bioleaching and vat leaching. Also, given the possibility of reopening the mining -\nmilling complex, all available data have  been processed to redefine the geological model and \nformulate more suitable mining and processing designs.   \nNATIONAL REPORTS : ARGENTINA  \n150 URA NIUM 202 2: RESOURCES, PRODUCTION AND DEMAND, NEA No. 7634, © OECD 202 3 The Cerro Solo Project  \nThe CNEA continues developing feasibility studies for the proposed mining of the Cerro Solo \ndeposit (Chubut Province) and se veral laboratory- scale tests have been carried out to determine \nthe most economically competitive milling process. Since the deposit contains molybdenum in \naddition to uranium, identifying an appropriate and feasible process is not trivial. Molybdenum \ncoul d be a valuable by- product, but its presence in the leachate could complicate the exchange \nresins, so another process, like liquid -liquid extraction, may be used. For this reason, all \npreliminary investigations have been critical steps in developing a prof itable production plan. \nRecently, the conceptual engineering has been defined.  \nIn the mining sector, a conceptual study was advanced and improved using specific software \nfor geological modelling. A pre -technical economic feasibility study was in developmen t, \nbeginning with prior validation of all information (tonnages, grade, geotechnical, geostructural \nand hydrogeological) and some surface works.  \nCurrently, the project is in standby status awaiting a governmental decision to continue it, \ntaking into consid eration the basic engineering studies of both the mining operation and the \nprocessing plant.  \nBeside s technical considerations, a Chubut provincial law 5001/03 that prevents open -pit \nmining remains in effect and mining projects need to wait for the Chubut p rovincial territory \nzoning provisions of the aforementioned law, as well as the introduction of a regulatory framework for mining in this jurisdiction.  \nOwnership structure of the uranium industry  \nIn Argentina, the uranium industry is owned by the government.

Currently, environmental studies are being undertaken on three major uranium production projects.   \nThe San Rafael Mining -Milling Complex Remediation Project (Mendoza Province)  \nAs stated in the 2018 edition of the Red Book, an update of the 2006 EIA (MGIA -2013) had been \npresented to the authorities of the Mendoza Province. This study addressed only the  treatment of \nsolid wastes (currently in temporary storage) and open -pit mine water. The proposal received \ntechnical approval (2013 EIA), which was endorsed after the implementation of the statutory public hearing in 2019. In the meantime, the CNEA has continued to evaluate technical options to minimise environmental impacts and established additional security measures:  \n Effluent pond “DN 8 -9” \nAn evaporation pond (5  hectares) with a double lined waterproof high -density polyethylene \n(HDPE) geo -membrane and a  leakage detection system has been built, and hydraulic tests have \nbeen successfully accomplished. It is currently being used to manage open -pit water.  \n Effluent pond “DN 5”  \nThis precipitation facility is designed to treat open -pit water. This pond will hav e a total \noperational capacity of approximately 12 000 m3 and will have security drainage systems and \ndouble waterproofing HDPE geo -membrane to control potential leaks. Its purpose is to provide \nthe necessary conditions (residence time) to generate As and Ra precipitates before they are fed into the effluent pond “DN 8 -9” for final disposal.

From that date, a post -closure environmental and radiological monitoring programme was initiated.  \nThe Córdoba and Los Gigantes sites (Córdoba Province) have advanced detailed engineering \nprojects underway. The sites being studied are Huemul (Mendoza Province), Pichiñán (Chubut \nProvince), Tonco (Salta Province), La Estela (San Luis Province), and Los Colorados (La Rioja \nProvince), where environmental baseline studies are being developed. All these sites are the subject of periodic radiological and environmental monitoring. PRAMU seek s to improve the \nconditions of the tailing deposits and mines to ensure the long -term protection of people and the \nenvironment.  \nThe CNEA is required to comply with all legislation that is in force and is under the control \nof various national, provincial, and local state institutions.  \nRegulatory activities  \nArgentina’s provinces have legislation limiting certain aspects of mining activities (e.g.  use of \ncertain substances, open -pit mining). The local regulations co- exist with national legislation \nrelated to mining activities and environmental protection.  \nNational regulations  \n• Law No. 25 675: “General Environmental Law” establishes minimum standards for \nachieving sustainable management of the environment, the preservation and protection \nof biodiversity and the implementation of sustainable development.  \n• Law No. 1 919: “National Mining Code”, which in Title Eleventh (Articles 205 to 212) refers to nuclear minerals (U and Th).  \n• Law No. 24 585: Requirement to submit an environmental impact assessment (EIA) prior \nto each stage of development of a mining project. It sets the maximum acceptable limits \nof various effluent parameters in water, air and soil.  \nMendoza provincial regulations  \n• Law No. 3 790, created the Mining General Direction with specific functions related to  the \nadministration, control and promotion of the mining industry in all its phases throughout \nthe province.  \n• Law No. 7 722 prohibits the use of chemicals such as cyanide, mercury, sulphuric acid, and \nother toxic substances typically used in metalliferous m ining, including prospecting, \nexploration, exploitation and industrialisation of metal ores obtained by any extraction method in the province.  \n• Resolution No. 778/96 of the General Department of Irrigation (DGI) regulates all activities \nthat potentially aff ect surface water and groundwater quality in the province.  \nChubut provincial regulations  \n• Law XVII- No. 68 prohibits open -pit metal mining in the province, as well as the use of \ncyanide in mining production processes. It also specifies the need for zoning in  the \nprovince for the exploitation of mineral resources with an approved production model \nrequired for each case.  \nNATIONAL REPORTS : ARGENTINA  \n154 URA NIUM 202 2: RESOURCES, PRODUCTION AND DEMAND, NEA No. 7634, © OECD 202 3 Uranium requirements  \nThe uranium requirements listed below correspond to an estimate made in the Strategic \nNuclear Energy Planning 2010- 2030 a nd the reactivation of the Argentine Nuclear Energy Plan \nlaunched in 2006. As of the end of 2020, the nuclear plan’s status is as follows:  \n• finishing construction and commissioning Atucha II (achieved);  \n• extending the licence of Embalse (achieved);  \n• extendin g the licence of Atucha I (committed);  \n• construction of the 4th and 5th nuclear power plants (although only construction of one is \ncurrently planned);  \n• development and construction of a small modular nuclear power reactor (CAREM; in \nprogress);  \n• reactivation o f uranium enrichment (in progress);  \n• reactivation of uranium mining industry (in stand by status).  \nThe most important update in Argentina’s nuclear production was the start -up of Atucha II \n(745 MWe), reaching first criticality at the end of 2014 and obtaini ng its commercial operating \nlicence in 2016.  \nBetween 2016 and 2018, Embalse was out of the electricity generation system for \nrefurbishment tasks designed to extend its operating time  frame  by 30 years, which also increased \nits output by an additional 35 MWe. In January 2019, the refurbished unit successfully reached \ncriticality and in August of the same year obtained a commercial operation licence for its second life cycle.  \nDuring 2024, Atucha I will be inoperative as it undergoes facility refurbishment to extend \noperation until 2046.  \nAlso proposed is the expansion of the nuclear energy network, which would be covered by \nthe construction of a fourth nuclear power plant consisting of a PWR -type reactor (1  150 MWe \nby 2030).  \nIn addition, the CNEA is carrying o ut the construction of the CAREM (27  MWe), a small \nmodular reactor prototype expected to come into operation by 2025. Planning is underway to \nbuild another larger unit, CAREM -120 (120 MWe), which is expected to begin operating by 2030.  \nA pilot plant for ur anium enrichment located in the Pilcaniyeu Technological Complex \n(Bariloche) was operated in the 1980s and early 1990s before deactivation in 1995. A restart \nproject was launched in 2006 and operations resumed in March 2014, enabling Argentina to \nproduce e nriched uranium by gaseous diffusion technology. The plant  has a capacity of \n20 000 SWU/ year and in 2 015 enriched about 600 kg of UF\n6. The CNEA is currently engaged in \nthe development of other enrichment technologies, such as ultra -centrifuges and lasers.  \nSupply and procurement strategy  \nIn 1992, due to low prices in international markets, uranium concentrates began to be imported from South Africa, eventually leading to the closure of local production in 1997. Since then, there \nhas been no production of ura nium in Argentina and uranium requirements for operating \nnuclear power plants have been met with raw mat erial imports from abroad (i.e.  Uzbekistan, \nCzech Republic, Kazakhstan and Canada).  \nAt present, both government and industry are carrying out exploratio n projects with the \nintention of restarting domestic uranium production to achieve the goal of self -sufficiency in \nuranium supply.  \n NATIONAL REPORTS : ARGENTINA  \nURANIUM 202 2: RESOURCES, PRODUCTION AND DEMAND, NEA No. 7634, ©  OECD 20 23 155 Uranium policies, uranium stocks and uranium prices  \nNational policies relating to uranium  \nThe Nuclear Activity Law of 1997 es tablishes the roles of the CNEA and the Nuclear Regulatory \nAuthority. It also provides for the participation of the public and private sectors in uranium \nexploration and development activities.  \nThe National Mining Code of 1994 states that nuclear minerals (uranium and thorium) can \nbe explored and exploited by both the national government and the private sector with legal \nlicences issued by a Competent Provincial Authority. The national government has the first \noption to purchase all uranium and thorium prod uced in Argentina and the export of nuclear \nminerals depends upon first guaranteeing domestic supply and control of the destination of any exports. The government also regulates development activities to ensure practices comply with international environme ntal standards.  \nUranium stocks  \nNucleoelectrica Argentina S.A., operator of the domestic nuclear power plants, implements the \nuranium supply policy and is responsible for guaranteeing a uranium fuel stock of at least two \nyears for Argentina’s operational nu clear power plants.  \nThe uranium dioxide producing company (Dioxitek S.A.) acquires uranium oxide concentrates, \nwhich in recent years have come from Canada and Kazakhstan. On average, the country imports \napproximately 220 tU annually.  \nIn addition, the fue l fabrication company (Conuar S.A.) every year imports a few tonnes of \nlow-enriched uranium (LEU), which is required for manufacturing slightly enriched uranium \n(SEU: 0.85% U -235) fuel for Atucha II and low -enriched uranium (LEU: 1.9/3.2% U -235) fuel for t he \nCAREM SMR prototype.   \nUranium prices  \nSince 1997 uranium needs have been entirely met with purchases on the spot market through international tenders, without subscribing to medium - or long -term supply contracts.  \nIn recent years, the average prices paid by the country have ranged from USD 125/kgU to \nUSD 150/kgU, including transportation fares, taxes, and insurance premiums.  \n  \nNATIONAL REPORTS : ARGENTINA  \n156 URA NIUM 202 2: RESOURCES, PRODUCTION AND DEMAND, NEA No. 7634, © OECD 202 3 Uranium exploration and development expenditures and drilling effort –  domestic  \n(In Argentine pesos [ARS])  \n 2018 2019 2020 2021 (ex pected)  \nPrivate* exploration expenditures  39 000 000  32 300 000  48 800 000  287 000 000  \nGovernment exploration expenditures  26 900 000  31 800 000  27 380 000  62 990 000  \nPrivate* development expenditures  0 0 0 0 \nGovernment development expenditures  0 0 0 0 \nTotal expenditures  65 900 000  64 100 000  76 180 000  349 990 000  \nPrivate* exploration drilling (m)  2 373  654 385 4 115  \nPrivate* exploration holes drilled  236 88 8 80 \nPrivate* exploration trenches (metres)  60 0 0 100 \nPrivate* tranches (number)  39 0 0 20 \nGovernment exploration drilling (metres)  0 0 0 0 \nGovernment exploration holes drilled  0 0 0 0 \nGovernment exploration trenches (m)  0 0 0 0 \nGovernment trenches (number)  0 0 0 0 \nPrivate* development drilling (m)  0 0 0 0 \nPrivate* development holes dri lled 0 0 0 0 \nGovernment development drilling (m)  0 0 0 0 \nGovernment development holes drilled  0 0 0 0 \nSubtotal exploration drilling (m)  2 373  654 385 4 115  \nSubtotal exploration holes drilled  236 88 8 80 \nSubtotal development drilling (m)  0 0 0 0 \nSubto tal development holes drilled  0 0 0 0 \nTotal drilling (m)  2 373  654  385  4 115  \nTotal number of holes drilled  236  88 8 80 \n* Expenditures made by private companies.

The founders of ARMC are the Armenian  government and \nAtomredmetzoloto of Russia.  \nWithin this framework, the collection and analysis of archival material relevant to uranium \nmining was completed, and a document, “Geologic Exploration Activity for 2009 -2010 ”, specifically \nregarding uranium ore exploration i n Armenia, was published and approved.  \nIn the s pring of 2009, fieldwork related to uranium exploration started in the province of \nSyunik. Geological prospecting carried out on the first Voghchi zone of the Pkhrut -Lernadzor \nlicenced area in 2011 identified  some anomalies. All plans for geologic prospecting in 2011 were \nfulfilled by January 2012. Exploration of the first Voghchi zone of the Pkhrut deposit led to the identification of a very small occurrence, below 1  000 tU inferred resources (category C2 in \nRussian classification), and indicated that the deposit is prospective.  \nIn 2013, the Armenian -Russian joint venture activities were suspended due to unfavourable \nuranium market prices.  \nUranium production  \nArmenia does not produce uranium, so there is no as sociated infrastructure (legislation, \nregulatory authority, licencing/authorisation system, inspection, etc.).  \nAccording to the Strategic Programme for the Development of the Energy Sector of the \nRepublic of Armenia, uranium mining is not foreseen until 20 40. On 14 January 2021, this \nprogramme was approved by the government of the Republic of Armenia.  \nUranium requirements  \nThere have been no changes to Armenia’s nuclear energy programme during the past two years. \nThe country’s short -term uranium requirement s remain the same and are based on the \noperation of one VVER -440 unit (Armenian -2). A detailed forecast for uranium requirements was \ncarried out, considering the designed lifetime for this reactor, which has an installed capacity \nof about 407.5  MWe.  \nLong -term uranium requirements depend on the country’s policy in the nuclear energy \nsector. The approval of the Strategic Programme for the Development of the Energy Sector until \n2040, and the schedule ensuring the implementation of this Strategic Programme, inc lude as \npriorities the extension of operations of the existing power reactor from 2026 to 2036 and the \nconstruction of a new nuclear power plant.  \nNATIONAL REPORTS : ARMENIA  \n162 URA NIUM 202 2: RESOURCES, PRODUCTION AND DEMAND, NEA No. 7634, © OECD 202 3 Supply and procurement strategy  \nNuclear fuel for the Armenian nuclear power plant is supplied by Russia.

The majority of Australia’ s \nsignificant uranium deposits were discovered between 1969 and 1980 when exploration \nexpenditures for the commodity were relatively high. Uranium exploration budgets have \ngenerally declined since the greenfields discovery of the Kintyre deposit in Western  Australia by \nConzinc Rio Tinto of Australia (CRA) in 1985. Despite the lack of major recent greenfields \ndiscoveries, the resource base has grown through significant brownfields extensions to known \nresources, and some new occurrences delineated proximally to these with similar geology.  \nDiscovered by Western Mining in 1975 and owned and operated by BHP since 2005, the \nOlympic Dam mine in South Australia is the world’s largest single uranium resource. Production has been continuous since 1988. Australia’s uranium has usually been produced from a small \nnumber of mines (often only three), though production has shifted localities over time. Mining \nhas occurred at Mary Kathleen and Westmoreland in Queensland; Radium Hill, Mount Painter, \nHoneymoon, F our Mile and Beverley in South Australia; along with Ranger, Narbalek and Rum \nJungle in the Northern Territory.  \nMost of Australia’s uranium resources occur in two main types of deposits: breccia complex \ndeposits, such as Olympic Dam, or unconformity -relate d deposits, such as Ranger or Kintyre. \nOther categories include sandstone uranium deposits, such as Honeymoon; surficial (calcrete) \ndeposits such as Yeelirrie or Centipede; and metasomatite, metamorphic, volcanic or intrusive \ndeposits. Australia has no sig nificant deposits of the quartz -pebble conglomerate -type, vein -type \nand collapse breccia -pipe type.  \nAustralia currently has two operating mines that produce uranium, Olympic Dam and Four \nMile, both in South Australia.  \nRecent and ongoing uranium exploration  and mine development activities  \nMineral exploration in Australia is undertaken exclusively by commercial entities. However, \nquality geoscientific databases and information systems are maintained and made available by \nthe Federal Government and relevant st ate or territory governments, augmenting Australia’s \nfavourable geological settings.  \nExploration expenditure for uranium decreased in 2020 to AUD  6.7 million from \nAUD 10.2 million in 2019 and AUD 12.3 million in 2018.  \nWestern Australia  \n Mulga Rock  \nThe sandstone -type Mulga Rock resource is wholly owned by Vimy R esources Ltd. It is located \n240 kilometres east of Kalgoorlie in Western Australia and consists of four deposits, Ambassador, \nEmperor, Princess and Shogun. The project involves shallow open -pit minin g of four polymetallic \ndeposits with commercial grades of uranium situated in sandstone -hosted carbonaceous material. \nIt has a 15 -year mine life and is anticipated to produce 1  346 tU annually. In January 2018, Vimy \nResources released a definitive feasibility study for the Mulga Rock project and in September 2021 \nNATIONAL REPORTS : AUSTRALIA  \n164 URA NIUM 202 2: RESOURCES, PRODUCTION AND DEMAND, NEA No. 7634, © OECD 202 3 the Western Australian Department of Mines, Industry Regulation and Safety approved the Mulga \nRock mining proposal and associated mine closure plan.  \n Yeelirrie  \nThe surficial calcrete -hosted Yeelirri e uranium deposit is wholly owned by Cameco Australia \nPty Ltd and is located about 420  km north of Kalgoorlie and 70 km south -west of Wiluna in \nWestern Australia. It is one of the world’s largest surficial uranium deposits and is therefore \nsuited to open -pit mining with minimal drilling or blasting required. Cameco acquired the \nYeelirrie project from BHP in 2012.  \nThe Yeelirrie Uranium Project received environmental approval from the Western Australia \nGovernment in January 2017 and the Commonwealth Governme nt in April 2019.  \nFuture development of the Yeelirrie Uranium Project will depend on better market \nconditions. It is estimated that average production from the Yeelirrie project would be nearly 3 300 tU per annum over 19 years, utilising open -pit mining a nd alkaline leach technology.  \n Kintyre  \nThe unconformity -related Kintyre uranium deposit is wholly owned by Cameco Australia Pty \nLtd, which in 2018 acquired the 30% interest that was held by Mitsubishi Development Pty Ltd. \nKintyre is located in the East Pilb ara region of Western Australia, approximately 260  km \nnortheast of Newman at the western edge of the Great Sandy Desert. Although there is no \noutcrop, the Kintyre resource is suited to open -pit mining with the uppermost parts of the \nresource 50  m below sur face.  \nCameco Australia secured environmental approval for the Kintyre project in 2015 from the \nCommonwealth and Western Australian governments. Future development of the Kintyre Uranium Project will depend on better market conditions. Production from the Kintyre project is estimated at around 2  290 tU per annum, with an estimated mine life of 15 years.  \n Wiluna Uranium Project  \nToro Energy Ltd is the single owner of the Wiluna Uranium Project, which is a surficial calcrete -\nhosted regional resource located 30 km from the town of Wiluna in central Western Australia. Wiluna comprises six deposits: Centipede, Lake Way, Millipede, Lake Maitland, Dawson Hinkler and Nowathanna. The first four deposits collectively make up the Wiluna Uranium Project, while the Dawson Hinkler and Nowathanna deposits are regarded as advanced exploration prospects.  \nMining of the Centipede and Lake Way uranium deposits, including the construction of a \nprocessing facility at Centipede, received environmental approval from the Western Austra lian \ngovernment in 2012 and the Commonwealth Government in 2013. Toro expanded the Wiluna project proposal, which encompasses the Lake Maitland and Millipede resources, and received environmental approval from the Western Australian government in January 2 017 and the \nCommonwealth in July 2017.  \nMining at Wiluna is planned as shallow strip excavation to a maximum depth of 15 metres. \nThe project proposes to use alkaline agitated leaching in tanks at elevated temperatures to process the ore. Production is estim ated to be approximately 577 tU per annum.  \nSouth Australia  \nSouth Australia has five approved uranium mines: Olympic Dam, Honeymoon, Beverley, \nBeverley North and Four Mile. Only Olympic Dam and Four Mile produced uranium as of 2020. \nMining at Beverley and B everley North has ceased and the sites are working towards closure.  \n Olympic Dam  \nBHP Ltd’s breccia complex -hosted Olympic Dam is Australia’s largest uranium mine, contributing \naround two -thirds of Australia’s uranium production as a by -product to primary co pper \nproduction. Plans for a large expansion at Olympic Dam have been scaled back, although BHP \nplans to steadily increase production capacity under its existing approvals, and in 2018, \nunderground operations commenced in the “Southern Mining Area” of the resource. While \nNATIONAL REPORTS : AUSTRALIA  \nURANIUM 202 2: RESOURCES, PRODUCTION AND DEMAND, NEA No. 7634, ©  OECD 20 23 165 production is planned to remain stable in the near term, it is anticipated output will increase over \ntime through incremental production efficiency gains and infrastructure investment.  \n Four Mile  \nThe Four Mile mine is located approximately 5 50 km north of Adelaide. It is operated by Quasar \nResources Pty Ltd using in situ recovery (ISR) to extract uranium from sandstone deposits. \nUranium is extracted at Four Mile West with other ore bodies identified and under continued \ndelineation at Four Mile East, Four Mile North East and Four Mile North. Uranium -bearing resin \nfrom Four Mile is pumped to the Beverley processing plant for elution, precipitation and drying as uranium concentrate.  \n Honeymoon  \nOperated by Boss Energy Ltd, the sandstone- type Honeym oon deposit is currently in care and \nmaintenance. However, it remains approved for mining and exploration and metallurgical test work continues. Mineral exploration continued by Boss Energy in the Yarramba and Billeroo \npalaeochannels with new resources ide ntified at the Gould’s Dam and Jason’s deposit. The \nHoneymoon project comprising, Honeymoon, Gould’s Dam and Jason’s, has identified, \nrecoverable resources of 23 306 tU. Boss Energy released an Enhanced Feasibility Study of the \nHoneymoon Project in June 20 21. \nNorthern Territory  \n Ranger  \nUranium production at the Ranger mine ceased on 8 January 2021 after 40 years of operation that totalled approximately 112 000 tU. The Ranger mine, operated by Energy Resources Australia (ERA; majority owner Rio Tinto with 86. 3%) is located in the Pine Creek Inlier and is classified as an \nunconformity -related deposit. In 2012, Pit 3 mining operations ceased, with production from 2013 \nbeing maintained through stockpiled ore material. Activities ceased at Ranger Open Pit  1 in 1994, \nand as a part of the closure, the pit was filled with tailings and waste rock with a laterite clay cap \nbeing placed on the pit surface in 2016. Rehabilitation of the mine area is scheduled to be \ncompleted by January 2026.  \n Queensland  \nQueensland hosts mor e than 80 known sites that contain valuable amounts of uranium, mainly \nin the remote north -western area of the state. In March 2015, the incoming Queensland \ngovernment announced that it intended to reinstate a ban on uranium mining. The ban had been \nrepeal ed in 2012 by the previous government following a period of over 30 years during which no \nuranium mining had been undertaken in the state. Currently, Queensland allows uranium \nexploration but not mining.  \nNew South Wales  \nUranium exploration was prohibited in New South Wales for 26 years until 2012, when the state government overturned the ban. However, while uranium exploration is currently permitted, the ban on uranium mining remains in place.  \nUranium resources  \nIdentified conventional resources (reasonably  assured and inferred resources)  \nOn 1 January 2021, Australia’s total identified recoverable uranium resources at a cost of <USD  130/kgU amounted to 1 238 741 tU (1 907 495 tU in situ) of reasonably assured conventional \nresources and 445 356 tU (700 893 tU  in situ) of inferred conventional resources.  \n  \nNATIONAL REPORTS : AUSTRALIA  \n166 URA NIUM 202 2: RESOURCES, PRODUCTION AND DEMAND, NEA No. 7634, © OECD 202 3 Estimated mining and processing losses were deducted from commercial uranium resource \nreports for individual deposits submitted under the Australian Joint Ore Reserves Committee \n(JORC) Code. For deposits whe re this information is not available, an overall mining and milling \nrecovery factor was applied as recommended in the 2021 Red Book Questionnaire. Overall \nrecovery factors range from 58% to 95%.   \nNotable differences between Australia’s previous country rep ort (2020) include an overall \nincrease in RAR but decrease in inferred resources. This is principally accounted for by reported resources at Olympic Dam which show a significant increase in RAR but decrease in inferred \nresources. Additionally, recoverability information was updated for some deposits.  \nAlthough there are more than 35 deposits with identified resources recoverable at costs of \n<USD  130/kgU, the vast majority of Australia’s resources are within the following three individual \ndeposits: Olympic Da m in South Australia, Jabiluka in the Alligator Rivers Region of the Northern \nTerritory, and Yeelirrie in Western Australia. At the Olympic Dam mine, uranium is a by -product \nof copper mining, with gold and silver also recovered.  \nUndiscovered conventional resources (prognosticated and speculative resources)  \nGeoscience Australia does not make estimates of Australia’s undiscovered uranium resources.  \nUnconventional resources and other materials  \nGeoscience Australia does not make estimates of Australia’s unconv entional uranium resources.  \nUranium production  \nHistorical review  \nThe current phase of Australian uranium production commenced in 1976. Exports are \napproximately 6 600 (tU) per annum (averaged over ten years), or around 12% of the global market. \nUranium pro duced in Australia is exported to countries in North America, Asia and Europe, and \nis used as fuel in nuclear power stations to generate electricity.  \nA review of the history of uranium exploration, development and production in Australia is \nprovided in Au stralia’s Uranium Resources, Geology and Development of Deposits, available at: \nwww.ga.gov.au/webtemp/image_cache/GA9508.pdf . \nStatus of production capability and recent and ongoing activit ies \nAs of 1 January 2021, Australia had three operating uranium mines: Ranger (Energy Resources \nof Australia Ltd) in the Northern Territory, Olympic Dam (BHP Ltd) and Four Mile (Quasar \nResources Pty Ltd), both in South Australia. However, production at the  Ranger mine ceased on \n8 January 2021.  \nFive uranium projects in Australia are awaiting better market conditions before proceeding \nwith development: Honeymoon (Boss Energy Ltd) in South Australia, Kintyre and Yeelirrie (Cameco Australia Pty Ltd), Wiluna (Toro Energy Ltd), and Mulga Rock (Vimy Resources Ltd), all in Western Australia.  \nTotal uranium mine production for 2020 from the three operating mines, Olympic Dam, \nRanger and Four Mile, amounted to 6 195 tU.  \nOlympic Dam  \nOlympic Dam’s production of payable m etal in concentrate for 2020 was 3 062 tU, a decrease of \n300 tonnes from 2019. Olympic Dam contains well over one million tonnes of uranium resources, making it the largest single uranium deposit in the world. It is also the only known breccia \ncomplex depo sit that has significant economic resources of uranium. Olympic Dam produces \nNATIONAL REPORTS : AUSTRALIA  \nURANIUM 202 2: RESOURCES, PRODUCTION AND DEMAND, NEA No. 7634, ©  OECD 20 23 167 copper cathode, refined gold and silver bullion, along with uranium oxide. The BHP -owned \nunderground mine utilises long -hole open stoping technology and cemented aggregate fill, w ith \nintegrated metallurgical processing.  \nRanger  \nProduction at the Ranger mine was 1  335 tU in 2020, a decrease of 150 tonnes, or 10%, from the \n1 485 tU produced in 2019. All production at the Ranger mine ceased as of 8 January 2021. Energy \nResources Austra lia (ERA) has produced uranium at Ranger since 1981, with more than \n132 000 tonnes of uranium oxide concentrate (112 000 tU) produced. Mining at Ranger Pit  3 \nconcluded in December 2012, but stockpiled ore continued to be processed at the main \nmetallurgical plant and the laterite treatment plant until operations ceased.  \nRanger  3 Deeps was discovered in 2009 and is estimated to contain over 34 000 tonnes of \nuranium oxide (28  830 tU). ERA invested around AUD  120 million in an exploration decline, \nwhich was com menced in 2012 and completed in 2014, providing access to the resource for \nfurther analysis and assessment. In 2015, ERA’s majority owner, Rio Tinto, announced that after careful consideration the company did not support further study or the future develop ment of \nRanger  3 Deeps due to the economic challenges facing the project.  \nThe Gundjeihmi Aboriginal Corporation advised ERA in 2016 that the Mirarr Traditional \nOwners do not support the creation of a new Ranger Authority, which would provide the \nregulator y mechanism to enable mining after 2021. Rehabilitation activities at the Ranger site \nhave commenced and are scheduled to be completed by January 2026.  \nBeverley  \nThe sandstone -type Beverley resources, located east of the Flinders Ranges in South Australia, \nbegan operations in 1990. Production from Beverley, operated by Heathgate Resources Pty Ltd, started in late 2000, making it Australia’s first operating ISR mine. The Beverley and Beverley North mines have been in care and maintenance since early 2012 and 2018, respectively, and since late 2020 have moved into mine closure.  \nFour Mile  \nThe Four Mile resource comprises two significant sandstone uranium deposits, Four Mile East and Four Mile West, operated by Heathgate Resources on behalf of Quasar Resources P ty Ltd. \nThe initial phase of operations consisted of pumping uranium -bearing solutions to the nearby \nsatellite ion -exchange plant at the Pannikan deposit. The resin produced was initially trucked \nto the Beverley processing plant for elution, but as of October 2019 it is pumped via trunk lines \nfor precipitation and drying of the uranium concentrates.  \nHoneymoon  \nOperated by Boss Energy Ltd, which acquired it in 2015 from Uranium One (Rosatom – the \nRussian state -owned nuclear industry operator), Honeymoon remai ns in care and maintenance. \nUranium One’s production from the Honeymoon project ceased in November 2013. However, all \ngovernment approvals remain in place, and exploration and metallurgical test work continues.  \n  \nNATIONAL REPORTS : AUSTRALIA  \n168 URA NIUM 202 2: RESOURCES, PRODUCTION AND DEMAND, NEA No. 7634, © OECD 202 3 Uranium production centre technical detail s \n(as of 1 January 2021)  \n Centre #1  Centre #2  Centre #3  Centre #4  \nName of production centre  Olympic Dam  Four Mile (a)  Honeymoon  Mulga Rock  \nProduction centre classification  Existing  Existing  Planned  Planned  \nDate of first production (year)  1988  2014  2011  Not known \nSource of ore      \nDeposit name(s) or district name  Olympic Dam  Four Mile  Honeymoon, Gould’s \nDam Jason’s  Princess, Shogun, \nAmbassador, Emperor  \nDeposit type(s)  Polymetallic  \nFe-oxide breccia \ncomplex  Sandstone  Sandstone  Sandstone  \nRecoverable reso urces (tU)  1 328 837   14 680  23 306  28 836  \nGrade (% U)  0.048  0.29  0.15  0.08  \nMining operation      \nType (OP/UG/ISL)  UG ISR ISR OP \nSize (tonnes ore/day)  12 NA NA NA \nAverage mining recovery (%)  85 NA NA 95 \nProcessing plant      \nAcid/alkaline  Acid  Acid  Acid  Acid  \nType (IX/SX)  SX IX SX & IX   \nSize (tonnes ore/day)  12 NA NA NA \nAverage process recovery (%)  68 85 85 87.3  \nNominal production capacity (tU/year)  3 250  1 700  769 1 346  \nPlans for expansion (yes/no)  yes no no no \n \n Centre #5  Centre #6  Centre #7  \nName of production centre  Yeelirrie  Wiluna  Kintyre  \nProduction centre classification  Planned  Planned  Planned  \nDate of first production (year)  Not known  Not known  Not known  \nSource of ore     \nDeposit name(s) or district name  Yeelirrie  Centipede, Lake Way, \nMillipede, Lake Maitland  Kintyre  \nDeposit type(s)  Surficial (Calcrete)  Surficial (Calcrete)  Proterozoic unconformity  \nRecoverable resources (tU)  39 409  19 344  18 253  \nGrade (% U)  0.13  0.09  0.53  \nMining operation     \nType (OP/UG/ISL)  OP OP OP \nSize (tonnes or e/day)  NA NA NA \nAverage mining recovery (%)  NA NA NA \nProcessing plant     \nAcid/alkaline  Alkaline  Alkaline  Alkaline  \nType (IX/SX)  (d) IX NA \nSize (tonnes ore/day)  NA NA 1 700  \nAverage process recovery (%)  80 80 80 \nNominal production capacity (tU/year)  3 265 577 2 290  \nPlans for expansion (yes/no)  no  yes no \n(a) The Four Mile resource comprises Four Mile East and Four Mile West.

A Commonwealth \nassessment is conducted under the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999  \n(EPBC Act). An EPBC Act assessment is usually under taken bilaterally with relevant state and \nterritory authorities. An assessment is required for modifications to existing projects along with new proposals, ensuring that strict requirements for environmental, heritage and nuclear safeguards are maintained.   \nSocial factors are also considered in the approvals processes. In particular, Aboriginal Land \nRights and Native Title legislation ensures that the concerns and cultural needs of Aboriginal people are respected.  \nRecent environmental assessments include:  \n• BHP received approval in February 2015 from the Government of South Australia to raise \nthe wall height of Tailings Storage Facility 4, from 30  m to 40  m. Commonwealth approval \nwas not required. Previously, in 2012, BHP obtained approval to develop an open -pit mine. \nHowever, BHP has postponed this proposal indefinitely and, in 2016, announced plans to increase production through an underground expansion into the higher -grade Southern \nMining Area at Olympic Dam. In late 2019, BHP received approval to construct  Tailings \nStorage Facility 6 (TSF6) and in mid -2021, received approval to commission and operate \nTSF6. TSF6 replaces TSF4, which has now reached the end of its operational life.  \n• Cameco Australia’s Kintyre project obtained Western Australian state environme ntal \napproval in March 2015 and Commonwealth environmental approval in April 2015.  \n• Vimy Resources’s Mulga Rock project obtained Western Australian state environmental approval in December 2016 and Commonwealth environmental approval in March 2017. \nMost rec ently, in September 2021, the Western Australian Department of Mines, Industry \nRegulation and Safety approved the Mulga Rock mining proposal and associated mine \nclosure plan.  \n• Toro Energy’s Wiluna Extension project, encompassing the Lake Maitland and Millip ede \nresources, obtained Western Australian state environmental approval in January 2017 and Commonwealth environmental approval in July 2017.  \n• Cameco Australia’s Yeelirrie Uranium Project obtained Western Australian state \nenvironmental approval  in January 2 017 and Commonwealth environmental approval in \nApril 2019.  \nNATIONAL REPORTS : AUSTRALIA  \n170 URA NIUM 202 2: RESOURCES, PRODUCTION AND DEMAND, NEA No. 7634, © OECD 202 3 Site rehabilitation  \nThe Ranger mine, operated by Energy Resources Australia, ceased uranium production on \n8 January 2021. The Ranger project area will now undergo extensive rehabilitation work that  is \ndue to be completed by January 2026. Since 2012, ERA has spent in excess of AUD 683 million on \nrehabilitation and water treatment at Ranger and expects to invest an additional AUD  800 million \non rehabilitation by completion. The Ranger mine closure pla n was released by ERA in October \n2020 with the objective to rehabilitate the disturbed regions of the project area to a condition similar to the environment of the surrounding Kakadu National Park. The closure plan also \nincludes a maintenance and monitoring programme for 25 years after the rehabilitation \nprogramme is completed.  \nIndustry/government collaboration activities  \nThe Uranium Council (UC), formerly the Uranium Industry Framework (UIF), was established by the Australian government in 2009 to develop a sustainable Australian uranium mining sector in line with world’s best practice in environmental and safety standards. Membership of the UC comprises representatives of federal, state and territory government agencies, industry, and industry associations .  \nThe UC made a submission to the 2015 South Australian Royal Commission into the nuclear \nfuel cycle. The UC’s submission reviewed its (and the UIF’s) work undertaken in three key areas: \nhealth and safety, regulation and environmental protection, and community engagement. The \nsubmission also provided the following publications developed in response to UC (or UIF) initiatives:  \n• Safe and Effective Transport of Uranium  (2007);  \n• Review of Regulatory Efficiency in Uranium Mining (2008);  \n• Consolidated Indigenous En gagement Factsheets;  \n• Australia’s In Situ Recovery Uranium Mining Best Practice Guide: Groundwaters, Residues and \nRadiation Protection  (2010);  \n• Environmental Protection: Development of an Australian Approach for Assessing Effects of Ionising Radiation on Non- Human Species (2010);  \n• Guide to Safe Transport of Uranium Oxide Concentrate (2012);  \n• Uranium Oxide Concentrate (UOC) Transport Strategy  (2014).  \nFurther information on the UC can be found at www.industry.gov.au/about -us/what -we-\ndo/uranium -council .  \nNational Energy Resources Australia (NERA) is one of six growth centres established by the \nAustralian government under the Industry Growth Centres Initiative. Through a national focus, \nNERA’s roles are to grow collaboration and innovation to help the energy resources industry \n(petroleum, coal, and uranium) manage cost structures and productivity, direct research to \nindustry needs, deliver the future work skills required and promote fit fo r purpose regulation. \nTo do this, key strategies include:  \n• supporting collaborative and innovative research;  \n• building a resilient and agile supply chain through small and medium -sized enterprises \nand research sector collaboration;  \n• promoting industry sustain ability through developing a greater understanding of social, \nenvironmental, economic and operational consequences of industry activity.  \nTo date, NERA has developed a Sector Competitiveness Plan and in association with \nmanagement consultants, Accenture, undertook the Australian Uranium Industry Competitiveness Assessment. These reports have outlined several challenges facing the Australian uranium industry, but have also identified several opportunities to assist the industry in becoming more globally compe titive. Further information on NERA can be found at: \nwww.nera.org.au .  \nNATIONAL REPORTS : AUSTRALIA  \nURANIUM 202 2: RESOURCES, PRODUCTION AND DEMAND, NEA No. 7634, ©  OECD 20 23 171 Regulatory activities  \nRadiological protection matters arising from uranium mining in Australia are principally the \nresponsibility of the states an d territories where mining occurs. The Australian Radiation \nProtection and Nuclear Safety Agency (ARPANSA) is responsible for developing Australia’s \nnational radiological protection framework as laid out in the Radiation Protection Series (RPS), which are implemented through jurisdictional legislation and licence conditions.  \nARPANSA’s RPS includes a pivotal background document, RPS F -1 Fundamentals for Protection \nAgainst Ionising Radiation  (2014), and several codes and guides relating to uranium mining and  \nassociated processes:  \n• RPS 9 Code of Practice and Safety Guide for Radiation Protection and Radioactive Waste \nManagement in Mining and Mineral Processing (2005); RPS 15 Safety Guide for the Management of Naturally Occurring Radioactive Material (NORM) (2008);  \n• RPS 16 Safety Guide for the Predisposal Management of Radioactive Waste (2008);  \n• RPS 20 Safety Guide for Classification of Radioactive Waste (2010);  \n• RPS 9.1 Safety Guide for Monitoring, Assessing and Recording Occupational Radiation Doses in \nMining and  Mineral Processing (2011);  \n• RPS C -2 Code for the Safe Transport of Radioactive Material (2014);  \n• RPS G -1 Guide for Radiation Protection of the Environment (2015);  \n• RPS C -1 Code for Radiation Protection in Planned Exposure Situations (2016).  \nARPANSA continues  to develop frameworks that guide radiological protection best practice \nand works closely with industry representative bodies through relevant consultative processes. \nARPANSA also administers the Australian National Radiation Dose Register (ANRDR) for the \nstorage and maintenance of dose records of workers occupationally exposed to ionising \nradiation. Since 2013, ANRDR has complete coverage of the uranium mining and milling \nindustry in Australia with all operations submitting relevant dose records.  \nA Radon Progeny Technical Coordination Group was established with representation from the \nuranium mining industry, state regulators, and ARPANSA to develop a national approach to radon progeny dose assessment to address proposed changes in international recommenda tions. This \nincluded a programme of measurements in Australian uranium mines. This work has been \npublished as an Advisory Note on the ARPANSA website: New dose coefficients for radon progeny: \nImpact on workers and the public , and is available at: www.arpansa.gov.au/understanding -radiation/  \nsources- radiation/radon/new -dose -coefficients -radon -progeny -impact -workers .  \nThe Australian government released the 2016 edition of the Leading Practice Sustainable \nDevelopment Program for the Mining Industry (LPSDP)  of that year. The latest edition consists of a \n17-book series with several updated handbooks and two new handbooks –  Community Health and \nSafety and Energy Management in Mining . Further information on the Leading Practice handbooks \ncan be found at www.industry. gov.au/data- and-publications/leading -practice -handbooks -for-\nsustainable -mining .  \nUranium requirements  \nAustralia has no commercial nuclear power plants and has very limited domestic uranium \nrequirements. An Open Pool Australian Lightwater (OPAL) research r eactor is operated by the \nAustralian Nuclear Science and Technology Organisation (ANSTO) at Lucas Heights south of \nSydney, New South Wales. The OPAL reactor was opened in 2007, with the capacity to produce commercial quantities of radioisotopes utilising l ow-enriched uranium (LEU) fuel.  \nNATIONAL REPORTS : AUSTRALIA  \n172 URA NIUM 202 2: RESOURCES, PRODUCTION AND DEMAND, NEA No. 7634, © OECD 202 3 Uranium policies, uranium stocks and uranium prices  \nNational policies  \nAustralian policy states Australian uranium can only be sold to countries with which Australia \nhas a nuclear co -operation agreement, to ensure that count ries are committed to peaceful uses \nof nuclear energy. They must also have safeguards agreements with the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), including an Additional Protocol. Australia’s network of safeguards agreements now totals 43.  \nThe Australia n government supports the development of a sustainable Australian uranium \nmining sector in line with world’s best practice environmental and safety standards. Uranium \nexploration and mining are currently permissible in South Australia, the Northern Territory and \nWestern Australia. New South Wales overturned legislation prohibiting uranium exploration in 2012; however, uranium mining remains prohibited. In March 2015, Queensland stated it planned \nto reinstate the ban on uranium mining, which had been overtur ned in October 2012 by the \nprevious state government, but uranium exploration is permitted. Victoria currently prohibits \nboth uranium exploration and mining. In March 2017, the incoming Western Australian \ngovernment restated its commitment to place a ban o n future uranium activities except for mines \nthat had already been approved by the previous government.  \nAustralia currently has no plans to develop a domestic nuclear power industry, but interest \nat the state level led to the South Australian Nuclear Fuel Cycle Royal Commission in 2015 and, \nmore recently, the New South Wales Uranium Mining and Nuclear Facilities (Prohibitions) \nRepeal Bill 2019 and the Victorian Inquiry into Nuclear Energy Prohibition (2019). At the \nCommonwealth level, the House of Represent atives Standing Committee on the Environment and \nEnergy undertook an Inquiry into the Prerequisites for Nuclear Energy in Australia, also in 2019.  \nFurther, Regulation 9 of Australia’s Customs (Prohibited Exports) Regulations 1958, provides that \nthe export of goods listed in Schedule 7 of the Regulations is prohibited unless permission is \nobtained from the Commonwealth Minister for Industry, Innovation and Science or an authorised \nperson.

To implement that vision, the BAEC initiated an exploration programme for atomic minerals in favourable geological areas in Bangladesh.  \nFour regions in Bangladesh are considered to be interesting for uranium exploration: the \nEastern Mobile Belt, the Stable Platform, the Dauki Fault Belt and the Dinajpur Slope. The north -\neastern border of Bangladesh, located near the Meghalaya uranium province of India, is also potentia lly promising. Targets include sandstone and basement hosted deposits (U, U -Th-REE), \nas well as placer deposits (Th, U, REE).\n \nThe presence of radioactivity in U and Th bearing zircon-  and monazite -rich beach and river \nsand deposits in Bangladesh was report ed in the early 1960s. BAEC has been studying placer \nminerals along the coastal belts of Bangladesh since its independence and a programme of systematic exploration of heavy minerals was initiated in 1968. The entire south -eastern and \nsouthern coastal areas along with their offshore islands were explored from 1968 to 1986. From \nthis detailed survey, a total of 1.76 million tonnes of economic heavy minerals were estimated, \namong which uranium and thorium bearing zircon and monaz ite were estimated at \n1 158 117 tonnes and 17 352 tonnes, respectively. The findings include:\n \n• Testing of bulk sand samples by BAEC indicate that radioactive heavy minerals can be \nconcentrated in specific fractions.  \n• In separated zircon fractions, uranium and thorium values of up to 140  ppm  U (0.014% \nU), and 526 ppm Th were identified by neutron activation analysis.  \n• In radioactive sample concentrates, uranium and tho rium were measured as high as \n1 400 (0.14% U) and 700 ppm, respectively. Values from mineral grain concentrates were \nrecorde d as high as 37  600 ppm Th and 5 120 ppm U (0.512%  U) using high -resolution \ngamma -ray spectroscopy.  \nIn 1976, with assistance from the International Atomic Energy Agency and through the \nUnited Nations Development Programme, a reconnaissance radiometric surv ey was conducted \nthrough the Exploration of Uranium and Thorium in Bangladesh project. Some of the highlights of the project:\n \n• A regional reconnaissance survey was completed over a 2 000 km2 area of the greater \nChittagong and Chittagong Hill Tracts and Sylh et districts. More than 150 surface \nradiometric anomalies were identified.  \n• An aerial survey was completed over the Jaldi anticline, and a detailed survey was completed over a 450 km\n2 area including the Sylhet, Jaintia and Harargaj geological \nstructures.  \n• Radon surveys were carried out in a 35 km2 area over the Sylhet anticline and the Jaintia \nStructure.  \n• About 27 shallow boreholes were drilled in the Sylhet region resulting in the identification of more than 85 anomalies.  \nNATIONAL REPORTS:  BANGLADESH  \n178 URA NIUM 202 2: RESOURCES, PRODUCTION AND DEMAND, NEA No. 7634, © OECD 202 3 • Uranium indicators were identified  in the Harargaj anticline, Moulavibazar District, \nEastern Mobile Belt. Most of the samples collected from anomalous beds contain \nuranium and thorium ranging from 10 to 300 ppm (0.001 -0.03% U) and 100 to 1 000 ppm, \nrespectively. The highest radiometric cou nts occurred in the Phooltala Reserve Forest, at \n6 000 counts per second (60 times the background counts). Chemical analysis of this sample indicated the presence of 1  020 ppm of total uranium (0.102% U). Uranothorite \nand thorianite were identified in the rock samples.  \nThe project was suspended in 1985 before the follow -up exploration of prospective areas. \nBAEC reinitiated its uranium and thorium exploration activity in 1993 through the Exploration \nand Exploitation of Atomic Minerals: Joypurhat –  Sylhet Are a in the Dauki Fault project.  Project \noutcomes include:\n \n• In 1995, a radiometric survey was conducted over various locations along the Dauki Fault, Jaintiapur. Radioactivity in some locations was found to be 5 -6 times above background \nlevels. Also, radioactive counts were found to be 4 to 6 times the background level in the \nJadukata valley and 3.5 times the background level near the Rangpani River, with a maximum of up to 10 times the background level at one location.  \n• Gamma logging was completed in a 300 m deep drill hole (EDH -52, drilled by the \nGeological Survey of Bangladesh at Madarpur, Mithapukur, Rangpur). Total gamma count \nanomalies of 20 -25 times the background level were identified at various depths in the \ncrystalline basement rocks. Larger -scale follo w-up surveys have not yet been carried out \nin prospective regions due to limited budgets and technical know -how. However, BAEC \ncontinues to conduct small -scale exploration research.  \nRecent and ongoing uranium exploration activities   \nFrom 2018 to 2020, BAEC  completed uranium and thorium exploration over a 12  km2 area in the \nJaintiapur and adjacent Sylhet areas of north -east Bangladesh. The exploration was carried out \nthrough the Institute of Nuclear Minerals of the Atomic Energy Research Establishment.  \n• The r ange of radon concentration was measured as 8 to 4 360 Bq/m3 with an average of \n851 Bq/m3, with anomalous values of 2 120 to 4 360 Bq/m3 observed in the Tertiary \nsediments, and 8 to 584 Bq/m3 found in the recent alluvial soil.  \n• Samples were analysed by neu tron activation for uranium and thorium, and \nenrichments were attributed to the presence of monazite and zircon. Uranium values averaged 5  ppm (0.0005% U), with a maximum of 12  ppm (0.0012% U). Thorium averaged \n41 ppm, with a maximum of 100 ppm.   \n• Average b ackground spectrometric sample values were 611, 45, and 83 Bq/kg, for samples \n40K, 226Ra and 232Th, respectively. The highest values recorded for 40K were 1 040 Bq/kg, \nand 86 and 179 Bq/kg, for 226Ra and 232Th, respectively.  \nUranium exploration and develop ment expenditures and drilling effort  – Government \ndomestic  \n(BDT)  \n 2018 2019 2020 2021(expected)  \nGovernment exploration expenditures  500 000  500 000  600 000  700 000  \nTotal expenditures  500 000  500 000  600 000  700 000  \nTotal drilling (metres)  NA NA NA NA \nTotal number of holes drilled  NA NA NA NA \nNATIONAL REPORTS:  BANGLADESH  \nURANIUM 202 2: RESOURCES, PRODUCTION AND DEMAND, NEA No. 7634, ©  OECD 20 23 179 Recent mine development activities  \nBangladesh has no current or planned mine development activities.  \nUranium resources and production  \nBangladesh has no current uranium resources or production.  \nUranium requirement s  \nBangladesh began construction of its first nuclear power reactor (Rooppur 1) in November 2017 \nwith commissioning scheduled in 2023 and commercial production in 2023 or 2024. \nConstruction of the second unit at Rooppur commenced in July 2018, with complet ion scheduled \nfor 2024 and commercial production in 2024 or 2025.

In addition, the Uranium Metallurgy project of the Institute of Mining and \nMetallurgical Research, has the specific function of completing studies on the extraction of \nuranium concentrates and the o ptimisation of production costs based on new techniques within \nthe framework of the national nuclear policy.  \nThe main uranium exploration activities occurred in three stages.  \nFirst stage  \nIn 1953, at the request of the Bolivian government, the United Stat es Atomic Energy Commission \n(USAEC) sent a geological reconnaissance mission to the country to investigate the uranium \nexploration potential. The mission detected heightened radioactivity in some areas of Bolivia \n(Potosí and Cochabamba Departments) related  to old mines where copper, cobalt and nickel \nminerals were associated with uranium minerals in the Santa Cruz Department. During this \ncampaign, radioactive anomalies were also identified in the eastern highlands of Santa Cruz, as \na result of aerial reconn aissance.  \nFrom 1954 to 1955, the USAEC and the former National Department of Geology of Bolivia \n(DENAGEO) carried out a new exploration campaign, which despite many difficulties encountered \nin the field, yielded interesting results that were reflected in the report by Henderson and others*. \nAmong numerous mines investigated in the Cordillera and Altiplano regions, based on the \nmeasurements made on mineral samples, the tin porphyry mine Siglo XX (also known as Siglo \nVeinte, Llallagua, and Catavi), located c lose to the city of Llallagua in Bustillos province (Potosí), \nappeared to have good potential for uranium resources. In addition, other uranium indicators \nwere found in the areas of Sorata, in La Paz and Tasna, in Potosí.  \nSecond stage  \nIn 1963, on behalf o f the DENAGEO and the United Nations Development Program (UNDP), a \nSwedish consulting company carried out an aerial prospecting campaign, covering the Cordillera \nand the Altiplano regions.  \n  \n                                                      \n*  Henderson, J., M. Honea  and G. Donoso (1955), “Appraisal of uranium possibilities in Bolivia” , United States \nAtomic Energy Commission, Unpublished Report 4060.  \nNATIONA L REPORTS: BOLIVIA  \nURANIUM 202 2: RESOURCES, PRODUCTION AND DEMAND, NEA No. 7634, ©  OECD 20 23 181 The reports presented indicated that there were several radioact ive anomalies of variable \ndimensions, detected mainly in “La Meseta de Los Frailes” in an area of around 15 000 km2 . \nDespite uncertainties, it was concluded that there were enough indicators to guide the future \nexploration by COBOEN.  \nCOBOEN paid close at tention to the western part of the “Los Frailes” volcanic plateau with \nthe central Altiplano -Cordillera boundary. In 1968 the first exploratory work was planned in this \nvolcanic area.  \nIn 1970, the regional prospecting project began in the “Los Frailes” region, covering the \nadjacent altiplanic portion, located between Salinas, Sevaruyo and Río Mulato. During this campaign, the Cotaje deposit (the only Bolivian deposit at that time) was discovered in July 1970. In addition, regional prospecting work that yea r was carried out in the areas of Tupiza, Camargo \nand Uyuni.  \nAfter a technical evaluation of the economic possibilities of the uranium deposits, the \nHomestake Mining Co., in co- ordination with COBOEN, in 1973 recommended that the evaluation \nof the prospect s in the Sevaruyo area and prospecting in the Chacarilla area with ground and \naerial methods should continue and that anomalies found in the Tupiza area should be investigated.  \nIn December 1974, COBOEN authorities delivered two kilograms of uranium concent rates \n(yellowcake), obtained in its laboratories from Cotaje uranium deposit ore (Potosí), to the national government. This work was carried out in co -operation with the Nuclear Operations \nand Processes Division, and marked a technological milestone in Lat in America and for Bolivian \nnuclear metallurgy in particular.  \nThird stage  \nFrom 1975, prospecting and exploration was consolidated across Bolivia, though the rate of anomaly discovery was reduced. Activities at the Cotaje deposit were maintained to evalua te \nthe feasibility of the metallurgical mining project and to quantify the economic potential of existing resources, using donated UNDP exploration equipment.  \nIn 1977, the first uranium ore concentration pilot plant was inaugurated in Cotaje (the \nsecond i n Latin America). Its design, installation and start -up were undertaken exclusively by \nCOBOEN personnel.  \nIn order to increase deposit resources, physical exploration of the Cotaje metallurgical \nmining complex was intensified in 1979 by means of an electric al resistivity geophysical survey. \nThe geological evaluation found that the estimated resource base did not justify construction of an industrial plant for uranium processing. It was instead decided to expand the Cotaje pilot \nplant to a semi -industrial sca le with a declared rated annual production capacity of 4 tonnes of \nU\n3O8 in the form of commercial concentrates.  \nIn September 1980, the plant was officially inaugurated, but due to a limited budget and lack \nof prospecting equipment it was not possible to c ontinue with the discovery of additional \nresources in the country.  \nMining exploration work was resumed in 2008 when the Prefecture of the Department of \nPotosí contracted the services of the National Geological and Technical Mining Survey \n(SERGEOTECMIN, no w SERGEOMIN) to carry out a prospecting and exploration programme in \nthe Cotaje district and adjacent areas.  \nResults from the Cotaje mine indicated that mineralisation was low grade and not \ncommercially exploitable. In addition, the uranium grade was less than what was estimated by COBOEN in the 1970s.  \nDuring the 2009 -2010 period, SERGEOTECMIN conducted a radiometric prospecting survey \nin the sectors previously investigated by COBOEN, defining Tholapalca, Asunción and Coroma Este as the areas of greatest i nterest due to heightened uranium anomalies.  \n  \nNATIONAL REPORTS:  BOLIVIA  \n182 URA NIUM 202 2: RESOURCES, PRODUCTION AND DEMAND, NEA No. 7634, © OECD 202 3 Between 2009 and 2011, SERGEOTECMIN signed a contract with the Prefecture of Potosí and \nsubsequently with the Departmental Autonomous Government to conduct exploration.

Large airborne radiometric surveys were followed by ground \nsurveys, soil sampling, trenching and drilling. However, the thick sand cover in many parts of \nthe country hindered exploration acti vities. Exploration effectively ceased in the early 1980s \nwith the slump in uranium prices. No deposits of economic interest were discovered in this \nearly phase of exploration, but significant mineralisation was identified in the Karoo sandstones \nand surfi cial calcretes, particularly in the east -central part of the country.  \nRising uranium prices in 2005 renewed interest in uranium exploration by junior Australian \ncompanies, and by 2011, there were 168 uranium prospecting licences registered in Botswana.  \nA-Cap Resources (currently known as A -Cap Energy) has been exploring in Botswana since \n2004, following up on mineralisation discovered by Falconbridge in the 1970s in the Serowe area \nand further discovering significant mineralisation at the Letlhakane project . Intensive drilling \nresulted in A -Cap reporting Botswana’s first JORC compliant uranium resource in 2008 of just \nover 100 000 tU at an average grade of 129 ppm  U (0.0129%  U). \nAt the end of 2012, A -Cap’s prospecting licences for uranium covered 5  000 km2 while Impact \nMinerals Ltd controlled 26  000 km2. The two companies drilled a total of 12  462 m in 95  reverse \ncirculation holes during 2011 but no drilling was reported in 2012. Both companies completed regional ground gravity surveys and Impact Minerals Ltd  completed a soil geochemical survey \nover an area of 250  km\n2 at the Ikongwe prospect.  \nImpact Minerals Ltd, another Australian junior company, acquired permits around A -Cap’s \nareas in early 2008. Exploration activities in 2009 began with airborne radiometri c surveys, \nfollowed by field reconnaissance, mapping and drilling, leading to the discovery of four prospects in Karoo siltstones and sandstones. In addition to sandstone -hosted mineralisation, there were \ndiscoveries of uranium -bearing alaskitic rocks, sim ilar to those found at R össing in Namibia, and \nmineralisation related to Proterozoic sedimentary and basement rocks with similarities to the unconformity -related deposits in Canada and Australia. Further work is needed to assess the \nvalidity of the model a nd the potential of this unconformity style of mineralisation.  \nImpact Minerals was exploring some prospective deposits in eastern Botswana, including \nLekobolo, with uranium mineralisation down to 45  m. Further south, it had the Shoshong and \nIkongwe prospec ts in calcrete. In May 2013, Impact announced the sale of four prospecting \nlicences to a local company, Sechaba Natural Resources, but this was not completed due to licensing delays, and in 2014 Impact put its uranium exploration on hold and the majority of Impact’s prospecting licences within the Botswana uranium project licences were not renewed.  \n  \n                                                      \n*  Report prepared by the NEA/IAEA, based on previous Red Books and A -Cap Energy Ltd reports.  \nNATIONAL REPORTS: BOTSWANA  \n184 URA NIUM 202 2: RESOURCES, PRODUCTION AND DEMAND, NEA No. 7634, © OECD 202 3 The Letlhakane uranium deposit has been the focus of detailed technical work for A -Cap \nsince 2010, resulting in the February 2013 release of a positive scoping study. A thorough \nexamination of all aspects of the resource has led to a greater understanding of the framework \nand grade distribution of uranium mineralisation and the use of appropriate mining techniques to maximise the economics of the deposit.  \nThe ur anium mineralisation, hosted predominantly in carbonaceous mudstones and \nsiltstones, occurs in relatively thin (0.5 -5 m), laterally extensive lenses with lower -grade material \nseparating higher -grade ore horizons. The nature of the ore combined with shallow , flat -lying and \nsoft strata lends itself well to open -pit extraction methods. This information has resulted in a \nresource determination that is smaller than previously reported, but with higher grades.  \nA drilling programme was completed in September 2014 focusing on shallow high -grade \nzones where initial optimisation runs delineated possible early pits. This drilling was designed \nto test the continuity and mine scale variability of mineralisation in three main project areas \n(Kraken, Gorgon and Serule West ), and to provide data for further resource modelling and mine \nplanning. This drilling yielded excellent results and confirmed the presence and continuity of \nhigh- grade mineralisation within these areas.  \nA drill optimisation study has also been completed. The drill study focused on the Kraken \narea where infill drilling had previously been completed. Holes were then excluded to make pre -\ninfill drilling grids. These were completed at 400  m spacing and 200  m spacing as well as \n100 x 100 m and 50  x 100 m. At th e 400  m and 200  m spacing alternate offset grids were also used \nto evaluate consistency. The results from the Kraken area concluded that the drilling defines the resource at 200  m spacing and only small variations in grade and contained metal occur when \nthe infill drilling is conducted. This gives A -Cap an excellent guide to defining mineralisation for \nthe project as a whole.  \nAn infill drilling programme that was a follow -up to a major reverse circulation and diamond \ndrilling programme, completed in June 20 14, was commenced in October 2014 to further define \npotential early pilot pits. This programme was successfully completed in November. Resource evaluation, using uniform conditioning (UC) and localised uniform conditioning (LUC) techniques, \nwere conducted.  In September 2015, A -Cap announced an upgrade of Letlhakane resources \nutilising the LUC method. The resources for all deposits, in compliance with the JORC 2012 code, \nare presented in the table below.  \nResources reported by A -Cap, compliant with the JORC 2 012 code (September 2015)  \nCut -off \n(U ppm) Total  indicated  Total  inferred  Total  \nMt U  \n(ppm)  Contained  U \n(tU) Mt U \n(ppm)  Contained  \n(tU) Mt U \n(ppm)  Contained  U \n(tU) \n85 197.1  167 32 890  625 172 107 740  822.1  171 140 630  \n170 59.2  274 16 230  209.7  272 57 010  268.9  272 73 240 \n255 22.2  393 8 730  81.6  378 30 890  103.8  382 39 620 \nIn August 2015, a mining licence application was submitted to the Botswana Department of \nMines. The application was based on the results of a technical study and financial modelling, \nassuming open -pit mining and heap leaching processing, to produce 1  440 tU/yr over a mine life \nof 18 years. A detailed programme of acid column leaching, solvent extraction and ion exchange \nwas completed. Uranium recoveries varied from 60.5% to 77.7% depend ing on the mineralisation \ntype.  \nRecent and ongoing uranium exploration and mine development activities  \nIn 2017, A -Cap completed in -house processing studies with the objective of reducing acid \nconsumption and increasing recovery. Acid soluble uranium analysis was performed on \n296 samples. Results showed spatial and mineralogical relationships with high acid consumption \nNATIONAL REPORTS: BOTSWANA  \nURANIUM 202 2: RESOURCES, PRODUCTION AND DEMAND, NEA No. 7634, ©  OECD 20 23 185 in the Kraken and Gorgon South areas, exhibiting an increase in acid consumption with depth. \nOptimisation studies identified savings of up t o 26% of acid consumption.  \nA-Cap continued to assess the LUC resources in terms of mining optimisation and in \n2018 -2019 it continued to attend to the requirements of the Letlhakane Uranium Project’s \nmining licence, including meeting reporting requirements,  maintenance of the mining licence \nboundary, radiation inspectorate, compliance and engaging with the community to update them on the project’s status. The Department of Mines confirmed that the mining licence and \nall prospecting licences continue to be in  good standing.  \nUranium resources  \nIdentified conventional resources (reasonably assured and inferred resources)  \nIn September 2015, A -Cap Energy upgraded the global JORC Resource of the Letlhakane Uranium \nProject. Letlhakane hosts a global resource of 822. 1 million tonnes at 171  ppm uranium (0.017%  U) \nfor an in situ resource totalling 140  630 tU, based on an 85  ppm U cut -off grade. Within this \nresource, 32 890 tU belong to the RAR category and 107 740 tU to Inferred. Using a total recovery \nfactor of 62% (mining and processing), the total identified recoverable resource amounts to 87 190 tU in the <USD  130/kg U category.  \nA-Cap Energy has also defined a higher -grade resource of 73  240 tU, based on the 170  ppm  U \ncut-off grade, or 39  620 tU, based on the 255 ppm  U cut -off grade.  \nUndiscovered conventional resources (prognosticated and speculative resources)  \nThe key feature for uranium mineralisation in Botswana is the presence of highly radiogenic granitoid suites, most relating to the Pan -African (~500  Ma) magma tic event, which introduced \nuranium -rich source material into the upper crust. The uranium mineralisation is highly mobile \nand, through leaching, uranium -bearing solutions became concentrated in reduced environments \nin sandstones, mudstones and carbonaceou s materials in the overlying lower Karoo system.  \nMost calcareous sediments in the Gojwane and the Foley area, which lies on the Karoo and \nthe Karoo -aged sediments, are presumed to host widespread and continuous uranium \nmineralisation. These areas are consi dered to have the same geology as the Letlhakane area, \nwhich hosts one of the biggest undeveloped uranium deposits in Botswana.  \nImpact Minerals Ltd reports “target conceptual” undiscovered resources of less than 2  000 tU; \nhowever, the uncertainty of this t erm, and the small amount reported, do not warrant inclusion \nas undiscovered resources at this time. Although undiscovered resources no doubt exist, further work is required to develop the estimates.  \nUranium production  \nFrom 2013 -2015, A -Cap conducted feasi bility studies required for the application of a mining \nlicence for the Letlhakane Uranium Project.  \nPhysical test work on expected lithology mixes was done to evaluate productivity and mining \ncosts using surface miners. Metallurgical test work was complete d to optimise the process design \nand provide geotechnical, geochemical, and hydrological data for studies on heaps and waste \nproducts. Process test work was based on heap leach processing using acid leaching for the \nprimary oxide and secondary mudstone ore , and alkaline leaching for the secondary calcrete ore. \nThe uranium recoveries varied from 60.5% to 77.7% depending on mineralisation type.  \nOn completion of the feasibility study, a mining licence application was submitted to the \nBotswana Department of Mines in August 2015. The mining licence was granted by the Minister of Minerals, Energy and Water Resources on 12 September 2016, and is valid for 22 years.  \nNATIONAL REPORTS: BOTSWANA  \n186 URA NIUM 202 2: RESOURCES, PRODUCTION AND DEMAND, NEA No. 7634, © OECD 202 3 A-Cap Resources anticipated starting production at its uranium mine by 2018, with a \nproduction capaci ty of 1  440 tU/yr, at an average operating cost of USD  34.9/lb U 3O8 (USD  90.7/kgU) \nin the first five years and USD  40.70/lb U 3O8 (USD  105.8/kgU) during the life of the mine.  \nOn 23 April 2019, A -Cap met with the Botswana Department of Mines and submitted a letter \nrequesting an amendment to extend by two years the commencement of the pre -construction \nand construction period for the Letlhakane Uranium Project.

These efforts led to the discovery of the first uranium occurrences at Poços de Caldas (State of Min as Gerais) and Jacobina (State of Bahia). In 1955, a technical co -operation agreement was \nsigned with the United States to assess the uranium potential of Brazil. After the creation of the \nNational Nuclear Energy Commission (CNEN), a mineral exploration de partment was organised \nwith the support of the French Alternative Energies and Atomic Energy Commission (CEA) in 1962.  \nIn the 1970s, CNEN exploration for radioactive minerals accelerated with the addition of \nfinancial resources. Further incentive for exploration was provided in 1974 when the government \nopened NUCLEBRAS, an organisation with the exclusive purpose of uranium exploration and \nproduction. One of the early achievements of the government organisations was the discovery \nand development of the Osamu  Utsumi deposit on the Poços de Caldas plateau.  \nIn late 1975, Brazil and Germany signed a co -operation agreement for the peaceful use of \nnuclear energy. It was the beginning of an ambitious nuclear development programme that \nrequired NUCLEBRAS to increase its exploration activities. This led to the discovery of eight areas \nhosting uranium resources, including the Poços de Caldas plateau, Figueira, the Quadrilátero Ferrífero, Amorinópolis, Rio Preto/Campos Belos, Itataia, Lagoa Real and Espinharas (discovere d \nand evaluated by Nuclam, a Brazilian- German joint venture).  \nAs a result of the Brazilian nuclear development programme reorganisation of 1988, Indústrias \nNucleares do Brasil S.A. (INB) discontinued uranium exploration activities in 1991. Since then, limited exploration work has been done to further define resources in Lagoa Real province.  \nRecent and ongoing uranium exploration and mine development activities  \nDuring the 2012 -2017 period, exploration efforts focused on favourable areas related to albitic \nmetasomatites of LR 09, LR 35 and LR 36 deposits in the north part of the Lagoa Real province. \nNo exploration work was done during the 2018 -2020 period.  \nIn late 2020, the INB started the reassessment of resources in several deposits in the \nprovinces of Lago a Real and Santa Quitéria. Results were expected for the end of 2021.  \nUranium resources  \nIdentified conventional resources (reasonably assured and inferred resources)  \nBrazil’s conventional identified uranium resources are hosted in the following deposits:  \n• Poços de Caldas (Osamu Utsumi mine) with the orebodies A, B, E and Agostinho (collapse \nbreccia -type);  \n• Figueira and Amorinópolis (sandstone);  \n• Itataia, including the adjoining deposits of Alcantil and Serrotes Baixos (phosphate);  \n• Lagoa Real Province, Espinhar as (metasomatic);  \nNATIONAL REPORTS: BRAZIL  \n190 URA NIUM 202 2: RESOURCES, PRODUCTION AND DEMAND, NEA No. 7634, © OECD 202 3 • Campos Belos (metamorphite);  \n• Pitinga (by -product Sb/ Nb; granite -related);  \n• others including the Quadrilátero Ferrífero with the Gandarela and Serra des Gaivotas \ndeposits (paleo -quartz -pebble conglomerate).  \nNo additional resources were ide ntified during the 2019- 2020 period.  \nUndiscovered conventional resources (prognosticated and speculative resources)  \nBased on exploration activities in the Rio Cristalino (Proterozoic unconformity) area and additional resources at the Pitinga site (granite -related), in situ prognosticated resources are estimated to \namount to 300  000 tU. \nSpeculative uranium resources amount to some 500  000 tU according to a preliminary \nresource assessment that has been completed in geological environments with high uranium potential. Different geological types of uranium deposits were included in this estimate.  \nUranium production  \nHistorical review  \nThe Poços de Caldas uranium production facility, which started production in 1982 with a design \ncapacity of 425  tU/year, was opera ted by the state -owned company NUCLEBRAS until 1988. At \nthat time, Brazil’s nuclear activities were restructured. NUCLEBRAS was succeeded by the INB \nand its mineral assets transferred to Urânio do Brasil S.A. With the dissolution of Urânio do \nBrasil in 199 4, ownership of uranium production is 100% controlled by the INB, a state- owned \ncompany.  \nBetween 1990 and 1992, the production centre at Poços de Caldas was on standby because \nof increasing production costs and reduced demand. Production was restarted in l ate 1993 and \ncontinued until October 1995. After two years on standby, the Poços de Caldas production centre \nwas shut down in 1997 and a decommissioning programme started in 1998. This industrial \nfacility was used to produce rare earth compounds from monaz ite treatment until 2006, but \nclosed the next year for market reasons.  \nThe Caetité unit (Lagoa Real province) is currently the only uranium production facility in \noperation in Brazil.  The open -pit part of the Cachoeira deposit was entirely mined out in 20 14. \nStatus of production facilities, production capability, recent and ongoing activities and \nother issues  \nThe expansion of Caetité unit (Lagoa Real) to 670 tU/year is progressing and production is expected \nto restart in 2027. Expansion of the mine include s development of one unde rground and one open-\npit mine.  \nBoth the licensing process for underground mining of the remainder of the Cachoeira deposit \nand resource reassessments are underway. Production is expected to start in 2027.  \nPlanning for expansion inc luded the evaluation of several scenarios and involves \nreplacement of the current heap leaching (HL) process by conventional agitated leaching. The \noverall investment in this expansion is estimated to amount to USD  90 million.  \nSince 2014, the INB has been  working on the development of the Engenho deposit, which was \ninitially planned as an additional ore source for increased production at the Caetité plant, but is currently the only ore source for the plant due to the delay in commissioning the Cachoeira \nunderground mine. The unit started operating in a commissioning process in 2019 -2020 without \nsignificant production. Mine production in 2021 was 30 tU.  \nNATIONAL REPORTS: BRAZIL  \nURANIUM 202 2: RESOURCES, PRODUCTION AND DEMAND, NEA No. 7634, ©  OECD 20 23 191 Ownership structure of the uranium industry  \nThe Brazilian uranium industry is 100% state -owned through the  INB. \nEmployment in the uranium industry  \nEmployment at existing production centres slightly decreased in 2018 from 2016 -2017, with a \nsmall increase in 2019- 2020 (see table below).  \nFuture production centres  \nThe Santa Quitéria phosphate/uranium project, a partnership between the INB and a Brazilian \nfertiliser producer, remains under development.

Several studies have been carried out to charac terise \ngeochemical and hydrochemical aspects of the waste rock and tailings dam to better establish the \nimpact they may have had on the environment and to develop the necessary mitigation measures. \nA remediation/restoration plan, considering several altern atives, was submitted to the regulatory \nbody at the end of 2012. Depending on the option adopted, the costs of implementing the \nremediation/restoration plan could reach USD  300 million. In the meantime, some measures have \nbeen taken to reduce environmental  impacts, such as uranium recovery from acid drainage (resin), \nheavy metal precipitation (ozone), and surface drainage optimisation. The INB, regulators and \ncentral government are involved in the consolidation of a work plan for the remediation.  \nThe licen sing of Santa Quitéria Uranium/Phosphate Project is split into a non -nuclear part, \ninvolving milling and phosphate production, and a nuclear part, involving uranium concentrate \nproduction. The INB has applied for local construction licences under the guide lines established \nby the IBAMA and the CNEN.  \nRegulatory regime \nLicences are issued by the IBAMA, according to Brazilian environment law and CNEN regulations.  \nGovernment policies and regulations established by the CNEN include basic radiological \nprotection directives  (NE-3.01 – Diretrizes Básicas de Radioproteção ), standards for licensing of \nuranium mines and mills (NE -1.13 – Licenciamento de Minas e Usinas de Beneficiamento de Minérios de \nUrânio ou Tório) and decommissioning of tailing ponds (NE -1.10 – Segu rança de Sistema de Barragem \nde Rejeito Contendo Radionuclídeos ), as well as standards for conventional U and Th mining and \nmilling (NORM and TENORM NM 4.01 –  Requisitos de Segurança e Proteção Radiológica para Instalações \nMínero -Industriais ). In the absence of specific norms, the recommendations of the International \nCommission on Radiological Protection and the International Atomic Energy Agency are used.  \nThe CNEN oversees nuclear research and regulation, but due to the potential future growth of \nthe Brazi lian nuclear programme, the creation of a separate independent nuclear regulatory \nagency is under study by the federal government. In this regard, a bill was submitted to the congress in 2021.  \nUranium requirements  \nBrazil’s present uranium requirements for the Angra 1 nuclear power plant, a 630 MWe \npressurised water reactor (PWR), are about 150  tU/yr. The Angra  2 nuclear power plant, a \n1 245 MWe PWR, requires 220 tU/yr. The start -up of the Angra  3 nuclear power plant (a similar \ndesign to Angra  2) was scheduled initially for 2016, but construction was stopped in 2015. With \nthe resumption of construction, Angra 3 is scheduled to be operating in 2026. Once in operation, it will add another 220  tU/yr to annual domestic demand.  \nA new version of the national energy plan, “Plano Nacional de Energia 2050”  (PNE 2050), issued \nin 2020, is a fundamental study of long -term planning for the country’s energy sector. It assesses \ntrends in production and use of energy and evaluates alternative strategies for expanding energy supply in the coming decades. The PNE 2050 also establishes guidelines for the role of nuclear \npower in the national strategy, including post -Fukushima risk perception and increasing costs, \nmastery of the complete nuclear fuel production cycle, and the possibility of exporting such \nproducts, taking into consideration the scale of production and competitiveness. Depending on \ndifferent scenarios, nuclear generation could reach 10 GW in 2050.  \nNATIONAL REPORTS: BRAZIL  \nURANIUM 202 2: RESOURCES, PRODUCTION AND DEMAND, NEA No. 7634, ©  OECD 20 23 193 Supply and procurement strategy  \nAll domestic production is designated  for domestic requirements.

The first exploration activities were undertaken in 1935. More \nserious exploration activities using technological research methods an d economic calculations \nwere carried out between 1938 and 1939 with the co -operation of German specialists. The first \n300 tonnes of uranium ore were mined in 1939.  \nDuring 1946 -1947, Soviet geologists performed intensive geological investigations of the \nBuhovo ore deposit. In the spring of 1946, a joint Soviet -Bulgarian enterprise was established, but \nits activity ceased in 1956. The Rare Metals Bureau of the Council of Ministers was established and existed until 1992, when the government decided to cease al l uranium production activities.  \nA large number of exploration methods were applied: geological, geophysical, technological \nand combined methods. Aero -gamma -ray-spectrometry, hydro -radio -geochemical and water -\nhelium photography were used for exploration.  \nIn total, 39 ore deposits were discovered, dozens of mines were developed across the country, \nand two facilities for the processing of uranium ore and production of uranium concentrate \n(U\n3O8) were built in Buhovo and Eleshnitsa.  \nBulgarian uranium deposits a re small to medium in size (up to 10 000 tU), with ore grades of \nabout 0.1% U. They have complex morphologies and irregular mineralisation. Deposits exploited via classical mining methods have complex geological structures and are situated mainly in \nmounta in regions (Stara Planina, Rhodope massif, East Sredna Gora). The areas of the ore beds \nrange between 250 m\n2 to 20 000 m2, with an occurrence depth of about 500  m and low metal \nconcentration. Technical mining conditions and geological parameters resulted in a high prime \ncost and lower efficiency of uranium production.  \nThe main ore deposits for underground mining are: Buhovo near Sofia; Eleshnitsa, Senokos \nand Simitli in south -west Bulgaria; Vinishte and Smolyanovtsi in north -west Bulgaria; Sliven in \ncentral  Bulgaria; Smolyan, Dospat and Selishte in the Rhodopa Mountains.  \nWhen sediment -hosted mineralisation was found, the acid in situ leaching (ISL) mining \nmethod was adopted1. It was first used in 1969 and applied mainly (90% of the time) to sandstone -\nhosted  deposits (roll- front) using drilling systems (wellfields) for leaching, and occasionally (10% \nof the time) to hardrock deposits using underground systems.  \nDeposits of this type were found first in regions of the Upper Thracian Valley, then also in the \nStruma river valley and in the Dospat river valley. Uranium -bearing horizons occur at 30 to 250 m \nbelow the surface. Their thickness varies from 10 -12 m to 60 -80 m. Uranium mineralisation is \nhosted by Pliocene sandstone with a thickness varying from 0.4  m to  7-8 m. Uranium grades are \nvariable, within large limits, but with an average value of 300 ppm U (0.03%  U).  \n                                                      \n*  This report is based on the 2007 and 2009 Red Books and a partial Red Book 2022 questionnaire response.  \n1  International Atomic Energy Agency, (2016), “In Situ Leach Uranium Mining: An Overview of Operations”, \nIAEA Nuclear Energy Series NF- T-1.4 report STI/PUB/1741.  \nNATIONAL REPORTS: BULGARIA  \nURANIUM 202 2: RESOURCES, PRODUCTION AND DEMAND, NEA No. 7634, ©  OECD 20 23 199 In the case of hardrock deposits, the dimensions of ore bodies vary by height from 50 -70 m \nto 500- 600 m and by thickness from 2 -4 m to 80 -100 m. Ur anium grades are between 0.03% U to \n0.2-0.3% U.  \nRecent and ongoing uranium exploration and mine development activities  \nUranium exploration and mine development activities were terminated in 1990.  No exploration \nwas conducted in recent years and no new expl oration is expected to be conducted as of 2021.   \nUranium resources  \nIdentified conventional resources (reasonably assured and inferred resources)  \nAs of 1 January 1991, identified conventional resources amounted to 20 565 tU in situ, which at \nthe time were d etermined to be subeconomic based upon prevailing market conditions and \nprocessing technology.  \nA revised resource estimate was made based on a select subset of deposits using data from \na Redki Metali State Company report (a final report coinciding with th e termination of uranium, \nexploration and mining activities in 1990) and from subsequent reports submitted to the \nSpecialised Expert Committee on Reserves and Resources (SEC), within the Ministry of \nEnvironment and Waters.  \nAs of 1 January 2009, the remain ing identified conventional uranium resources were \nestimated to be 19 809 tU in situ, of which 11 908 tU were determined to be amenable to underground mining methods, and 7 901 tU amenable to ISL methods.  \nThe 11 908 tU of in situ resources amenable to und erground  methods are associated with \n67 different sites (locations) where insignificant  quantities of uranium were detected. These \ndeposits and their resources were considered subeconomic with little or no production potential.  \nThe 7 901 tU of in situ res ources amenable to ISL mining methods were considered to be \npotentially economic. During production in 1991, an average recovery factor of 65% was achieved based on ISL operations at 16 sites.  \nTo date, no official estimates of the cost of production have b een performed. The stated \nevaluation of the identified conventional uranium resources is unchanged as of 1  January 2021. \nNo determinations of the identified conventional resources per cost category are available.  \nUndiscovered conventional resources (progno sticated and speculative resources)  \nPrognosticated conventional resources are estimated to amount  to about 25 000 in situ tU. \nNo classifications of the undiscovered conventional resources per cost category are available.  \nUnconventional Resources and other materials  \nNo unconventional resources have been identified.  \nUranium production  \nHistorical review  \nUp to 1990, 60 000 tU stocks were assessed and about 16 500 tU were produced. Production grew from 150 -200 tU/y in the 1950s to 430 tU in 1975. The adoption o f the ISL mining method for \nuranium production from Upper Thracian uranium deposi ts raised the production to 660  tU in \n1989, when 70% of the uranium was ISL extracted. Ores were processed in the two hydro metallurgical  plants. Uranium extraction from ISL so rbent resins and their processing was \ndone at the Zvezda plant near Eleshnitsa. U\n3O8 was produced with 80 -82% of concentration  \n(68-70% U).  \nNATIONAL REPORTS: BULGARIA  \n200 URA NIUM 202 2: RESOURCES, PRODUCTION AND DEMAND, NEA No. 7634, © OECD 202 3 Status of production facilities, production capability, recent and ongoing activities and \nother issues  \nAt present n o production centres exist that could be operated for uranium extraction. If plans \nfor the renewal of uranium production were considered, independent of who operates these \nfacilities, the entire process would need to be built from the beginning.  \nAt the fo rmer uranium ore processing plant Zvezda, an installation for ion -exchange resins \nis operational. This facility serves for the purification of uranium -contaminated mine waters. It \nis a small capacity installation of some 742  m3 of resins per year.  \nSince 1 992 the only activities have been the dismantling of facilities, closing of mining works, \nre-cultivation of contaminated areas, purification of uranium -contaminated mine waters, and \nenvironmental monitoring.  \nOwnership structure of the uranium industry  \nAll uranium production was carried out by the state.  \nEmployment in the uranium industry  \nThere is currently no uranium production and no exploration or production -related employment.  \nEnvironmental activities and socio -cultural issues  \nUranium production and proc essing ceased by Government Decree No 163 of 20 August  1992.  \nRemediation activities from uranium production and processing include: technical liquidation, \ntechnical and biological re -cultivation, purification of uranium -contaminated mine waters, and \nenvir onmental monitoring of the areas affected by the uranium mining.  \nPresently the main part of the environment re -cultivation from the uranium mining impact \nis considered completed.  \nUranium requirements  \nThe Bulgarian nuclear power programme was launched in 19 74 with the commissioning of the \nfirst nuclear power unit of the Kozloduy Nuclear Power Plant. The nuclear facilities are concentrated at the Kozloduy Nuclear Power Plant site, where six units were built (units 5 and \n6 are in operation and units 1 -4 are in  the process of decommissioning). In 2020, nuclear power \nprovided about 40.8% of total electricity production in Bulgaria. With an operable nuclear power \ncapacity of 2 006 MWe (2 VVER V -320 units at Kozloduy), uranium requirements are estimated \nat 322 tU/y ear.  \nThe lifetime extension of units 5 and 6 is a top priority. From 2014 to 2018, the Plant Lifetime \nExtension (PLEX) project was completed. The project results demonstrated the units’ technical \ncapabilities for long -term operation –  until 2047 for unit 5 and 2051 for unit 6. The Nuclear \nRegulatory Agency (NRA) Chairman issued operating licences for unit  5 in 2017 and for unit 6 in \n2019.  \nOn 22 May 2019, a call for the procedure to select a strategic investor for the Belene Nuclear \nPower Plant project was  published in the Official Journal of the European Union. The call also \ngave an opportunity to declare interest in acquiring a minority shareholding in the project, and/or for purchasing electricity from the power plant.  \nBy the deadline of 19 August 2019, 13 companies ha d submitted applications. On \n19 December  2019, a shortlist of candidates was published, to whom a call for binding tenders \nwas submitted. The shortlisted companies included China National Nuclear Corporation (CNNC), \nAtomenergoprom AD as part  of Rosatom, Korea Hydro -Nuclear Power, Framatom SAS, France, \nand General Electric, United States. The procedure envisages that negotiations be held with the \nNATIONAL REPORTS: BULGARIA  \nURANIUM 202 2: RESOURCES, PRODUCTION AND DEMAND, NEA No. 7634, ©  OECD 20 23 201 companies included in the shortlist to structure the Belene Nuclear Power Plant project. The \nimple mentation of the procedure has been delayed due to the COVID -19 pandemic.  \nBy decision of the Council of Ministers, dated April 2012, the construction of new nuclear \npower capacity at the Kozloduy Nuclear Power Plant was agreed upon in principle. In August 2013, \nthe NRA issued a permit for determining the location of a nuclear power plant (site selection). The \nfollowing activities have also been implemented: technical- economic analysis for the \nconstruction of a new nuclear power unit at the Kozloduy Nuclear Power Plant site; research and \ndetermining the location of the preferred site for the construction of new nuclear unit at Kozloduy; \nand performing an environmental impact assessment (EIA) of the investment proposal for \nbuilding a new nuclear power unit at the Kozloduy site. In 2016, a procedure was launched to appeal the EIA decision before the Supreme Administrative Court (SAC). In April 2019, the SAC rejected the appeal and the EIA decision was adopted. In the beginning on April 2019, a request \nfor approv al of the selected site was submitted. On 21  February 2020, an order to determine the \nlocation of the site (site 2) was issued by the Chairman of the NRA.  \nSupply and procurement strategy  \nThe Kozloduy Nuclear Power Plant fuel cycle does not include the purc hase of uranium, its \nconversion or enrichment, but only the purchase of fuel assemblies from the supplier, their \ninterim storage at the plant site after being removed from reactor cores, spent fuel transport for \nreprocessing, and further disposal of high -level waste. Those activities are based on an \nagreement between Bulgaria and Russia, as well as on commercial contracts for the supply of \nnuclear fuel and reprocessing of spent nuclear fuel.  \nIn accordance with the European Energy Security Strategy, a study was conducted to explore \noptions on diverse enriched uranium supplies for the manufacture of fuel assemblies, as well as for the identification of an alternative supplier of fuel assemblies.  \nUranium policies, uranium stocks and uranium prices  \nNational policies relating to uranium  \nThere have been no changes to the legal basis related to uranium. At present, Bulgaria does not intend to renew uranium mining activities.  \nUranium stocks  \nThere have been no changes in the uranium stock levels.  \nHistorical uranium production by production method  \n(tonnes U in concentrates)  \nProduction method  Total through \nend of 2018  2019 2020 Total through \nend of 2020  2021 (expected)  \nOpen -pit mining*  90 0 0 90 0 \nUnderground mining*  11 985  0 0 11 985  0 \nIn situ leaching  4 272  0 0 4 27 2 0 \nTotal  16 347  0 0 16 347  0 \n* Pre-2018 totals may include uranium recovered by heap and in -place leaching.  \n  \nNATIONAL REPORTS: BULGARIA  \n202 URA NIUM 202 2: RESOURCES, PRODUCTION AND DEMAND, NEA No. 7634, © OECD 202 3 Historical uranium production by processing method  \n(tonnes U in concentrates)  \nProcessing method  Total through \nend of 2018  2019 2020 Total throu gh \nend of 2020  2021 (expected)  \nConventional  11 526  0 0 11 526  0 \nIn-place leaching * 549 0 0 549 0 \nIn situ leaching  4 272  0 0 4 272  0 \nTotal  16 347  0 0 16 347  0 \n* Also known as stope leaching or block leaching.  \nHistorical uranium production by deposit type  \n(tonnes U in concentrates)  \nDeposit type  Total through \nend of 2018  2019 2020 Total through \nend of 2020  2021 \n(expected)  \nSandstone  8 700  0 0 8 700  0 \nPolymetallic Fe -oxide breccia complex  4 640  0 0 4 640  0 \nGranite -related  1 497  0 0 1 497  0 \nMetamorphite  366 0 0 366 0 \nVolcanic -related  1 144  0 0 1 144  0 \nTotal  16 347  0 0 16 347  0 \n \nNet nuclear electricity generation (TWh net)  \n 2019 2020 \nNuclear electricity generated (TWh net)  15.379  15.776  \nInstalled nuclear generating capacity to 2040  \n(MWe net)  \n2019 2020 2025 2030 2035 2040 \nNA NA Low  High  Low  High  Low  High  Low  High  \nNA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA \nAnnual reactor -related uranium requirements to 2040 (excluding MOX)  \n(tonnes U)  \n2019 2020 2025 2030 2035 2040 \nNA NA Low  High  Low  High  Low  High  Low  High  \nNA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA \n \nNATIONAL REPORTS: CANADA \nURANIUM 202 2: RESOURCES, PRODUCTION AND DEMAND, NEA No. 7634, ©  OECD 20 23 203 Canada \nUranium exploration  \nHistorical review  \nUranium exploration in Canada began in 1942, with the focus of activity first in the Northwest \nTerritories where pitchblende ore had been mined since the 1930s to extract radium. Exploration soon expanded to other areas of Canada, resulting in the development of mines in northern \nSaskatchewan and in the Elliot Lake and Bancroft regions of Ontario during the 1950s. In the late \n1960s, exploration returned to northern Saskatchewan where large high- grade unconformity \ndeposits were discovered in the Athabasca Basin and later developed (the first was the Rabbit Lake \ndeposit, discovered in 1968, and brought into production in 1975). Saskatchewan is now the sole \nproducer of uranium in Canada.  \nRecent and ongoing uranium exploration and mine development activities  \nDuring 2019 and 2020, exploration efforts continued to focus on areas favourable for the occurrence of deposits associated with the Proterozoic unconformity in the Athabasca Basin of Saskatchewan.  Very little exploration activity occurred in other areas of Canada in 2019 and 2020.  \nSurface drilling, as well as geophysical and geochemical surveys, continued to be the main \ntools used to identify new uranium occurrences, define extensions of known mine ralised zones, \nand reassess previously discovered deposits.  \nExploration activity has led to new uranium discoveries in the Athabasca Basin. Notable \nrecently discovered large high -grade uranium deposits include Phoenix/Gryphon, Triple R, \nArrow and Fox Lake.  \nDomestic uranium exploration expenditures amounted to CAD  162 million in 2019, down \n5% from CAD  170 million in 2018. Domestic exploration expenditures decreased further in 2020, \nto CAD  88 million, primarily due to the COVID -19 pandemic work restrictions. In 2019 and 2020, \noverall Canadian uranium exploration and development expenditures amounted to CAD  276 million and CAD  193 million, respectively . \nUranium resources  \nIdentified conventional resources (reasonably assured and inferred resources)  \nAs of 1 Janua ry 2021, Canada’s total identified conventional uranium resources recoverable at a \ncost of <USD  80/kgU amounted to 292 400 tU, an increase of 8.5 % from the 2019 estimate of \n269 500 tU. Canada’s total identified uranium resources recoverable at a cost of <U SD 130/kgU \nwere 588 500 tU as of 1  January 2021, an increase of 4.2% compared to the 2019 estimate of \n565 000 tU. These increases are primarily due to two unconformity deposits, Phoenix and Heldeth \nTúé, which are now proposed to be mined using lower cost I SL methods. Canada no longer report s \nuranium resources in the <USD  40/kgU cost category. Companies that previously reported \ndeposits with resources in the <USD 40/kgU cost category have reassessed these deposits using a \ncut-off grade that reflects a price of <USD 80/kgU. The <USD 80/kgU category more closely reflects \nrecent uranium prices as well as increased costs of production. Most of Canada’s identified \nuranium resources are re -evaluated annually by the uranium mining companies.  \nNATIONAL REPORTS: CANADA  \n204 URA NIUM 202 2: RESOURCES, PRODUCTION AND DEMAND, NEA No. 7634, © OECD 202 3 The bulk of Canada’s ide ntified conventional uranium resources occur in Proterozoic \nunconformity -related deposits in the Athabasca Basin of Saskatchewan and the Thelon Basin \nof Nunavut. These deposits host their mineralisation near the unconformity boundary (below, \nabove and acro ss) in either monometallic or polymetallic mineral assemblages. Pitchblende \nprevails in the monometallic deposits, whereas uranium -nickel -cobalt assemblages prevail in \nthe polymetallic assemblages. The average grade varies from 1%  U to over 15%  U. None of the \nuranium resources referred to or quantified herein are a co -product or by -product output of any \nother mineral of economic importance. Mining losses (~10%) and ore processing losses (~3%) were used to calculate known conventional resources if not provid ed by the company.  \nThe percentage of identified conventional uranium resources in existing or committed \nproduction centres that are recoverable at <USD 80/kgU, <USD  130/kgU and <USD  260/kgU are \n100%, 63.5% and 53.1%, respectively. All the resources in exis ting or committed production \ncentres are updated annually by the mining companies.  \nUndiscovered conventional resources (prognosticated and speculated resources)  \nPrognosticated and speculated resources have not been a part of recent resource assessments; hence there are no changes to report in these categories since 1  January 2001.  \nUranium production  \nHistorical review  \nCanada’s uranium industry began in the Northwest Territories with the 1930 discovery of the Port \nRadium pitchblende deposit. Exploited from 19 33 to 1940 for radium, the mine was reopened in \n1942 in response to uranium demand for the Manhattan Project. Provincial and Territorial bans \non private exploration and development were lifted in 1947 and 1948, and by the late 1950s some \n20 uranium product ion centres had started up in Ontario, Saskatchewan and the Northwest \nTerritories. Production peaked in 1959 at 12 200 tU. No further defence contracts were signed after \n1959 and production began to decline. Despite government stockpiling programmes, outpu t fell \nrapidly to less than 3  000 tU in 1966, by which time only four producers remained. While the first \ncommercial sales to electric utilities were signed in 1966, it was not until the mid -1970s that prices \nand demand had increased sufficiently to promot e expansions in exploration and development \nactivity. By the late 1970s, with the industry firmly re -established, several new facilities were \nunder development in Saskatchewan and Ontario. Annual output grew steadily throughout the \n1980s, as Canada’s focus  on uranium production shifted increasingly to Saskatchewan. The last \nremaining Ontario uranium mine closed in mid -1996. Uranium production peaked at 14 039 tU in \n2016 when the Cigar Lake mine reached full output, but production has declined since 2016 due  \nto the suspension of operations at Rabbit Lake and McArthur River/Key Lake in response to low uranium prices.  \nStatus of production capability and recent and ongoing activities  \nAll active uranium production centres are in northern Saskatchewan and operated  by Cameco \nCorp. (Cameco) and Orano Canada Ltd (Orano). Current Canadian uranium production is well below the full licensed production capacity of the uranium mills. Production in 2020 was 3  878 tU, \n44% below 2019 production of 6 944 tU, as operations were  suspended for six months due to the \nCOVID -19 pandemic. In 2020, Canadian uranium production was at its lowest level since 1975. The \nCigar Lake mine and McClean Lake mill were returned to production in April 2021; however, total \noutput for 2021 (4 692 tU) is still below 2019 production as operations continue to be affected by \nthe COVID -19 pandemic. Operations at the McArthur River mine and Key Lake mill have been \nsuspended since January 2018 in response to low uranium market prices. Cigar Lake is expected \nto return to full production (6  900 tU) in 2022 and Canadian production is expected to increase \nfurther when operations at McArthur River and Key Lake resume.  \n  \nNATIONAL REPORTS: CANADA \nURANIUM 202 2: RESOURCES, PRODUCTION AND DEMAND, NEA No. 7634, ©  OECD 20 23 205 Cameco is the operator of the McArthur River mine, a Cameco (70%) and Orano (30%) joint \nventure which was the world’s second -largest uranium mine in terms of annual production in \n2017 and is the world’s largest high -grade uranium deposit. Production was idled indefinitely in \nJanuary 2018 in response to low uranium demand; however, the mine is expecte d to restart when \nmarkets improve. At the mine, ground freezing is used to reduce water inflow from the overlying \nrock formation and the high -grade ore (>5%  U) is extracted using raise bore mining with concrete \nused as a backfill. A high -grade ore slurry i s produced by underground crushing, grinding and \nmixing, which is then pumped to the surface and loaded on specially designed containers that are shipped 80  km southward by road to the Key Lake mill. The remaining identified resources for \nMcArthur River mi ne are currently 154 100 tU with an average grade of 5.5%  U. \nThe Key Lake mill is a Cameco (83%) and Orano (17%) joint venture operated by Cameco. The \nmill has been in care and maintenance since January 2018 due to low uranium prices. In 2018, 61 tU were r ecovered from cleaning the mill circuits and a further 6.1 tU was recovered in 2019. \nThere was no production from the Key Lake mill in 2020.  \nThe McClean Lake production centre, operated by Orano, is a joint venture between Orano \n(77.5%) and Denison Mines C orp. (22.5%). In December 2020, Orano purchased the 7.5% share that \nwas held by Overseas Uranium Resources Development (Canada) Co. Ltd, a subsidiary of Overseas \nUranium Resources Development Corporation of Japan. Open -pit mining was completed in 2008 \nand ore containing 2  500 tU was stockpiled to provide mill feed. Production in 2009 and 2010 \namounted to 2  045 tU and was obtained from processing the higher -grade ore from the stockpile. \nThe 500 tU of ore remaining in the stockpile was not economic to process so the mill was placed \ninto care and maintenance in July 2010. Production from the McClean Lake JEB mill resumed in \n2014 to process low -grade ore from the stockpile and high -grade ore from the Cigar Lake mine. \nProduction from Cigar Lake ore was 6  938 tU in 2019, but dropped to 3 878 tU in 2020 and then \nincreased 4  692 tU in 2021, due to  the idling of operations for 6  months during the COVID -19 \npandemic and its lingering effects.  \nProduction from the Rabbit Lake production centre, wholly owned and operated by Cameco, \nhas been idled since mid -2016 due to low uranium prices. Production could resume when \nuranium prices recover. Exploratory drilling at the Eagle Point mine during the past several years \nhas increased identified resources to 27  000 tU at an averag e grade of 0.63% U.  \nCigar Lake, with identified resources of 111 100 tU at an average grade of 11%  U, is the world’s \nthird -largest high -grade uranium deposit. The mine began operation in March 2014 and is a \nCameco (50.025%), Orano (37.1%), Idemitsu (7.875% ) and Tokyo Electric Power Company (5%) joint \nventure operated by Cameco. Cigar Lake was the world’s largest producing uranium mine in 2019; however, production decreased by 44% in 2020 due to the COVID -19 pandemic, although \nproduction appears to be recove ring in 2021, it is 32% below 2019 production. Ground freezing is \nused to reduce groundwater inflow and ore is extracted using an innovative jet bore mining \nmethod with concrete used as backfill. The high -grade ore slurry is then shipped by road to the \nMcClean Lake (JEB) mill for processing. The McClean Lake mill produced 6 938  tU, 3 878 tU, and \n4 692 tU from Cigar Lake ore in 2019, 2020 and 2021 respectively.  \nOwnership structure of the uranium industry  \nCameco Corp. (Cameco) and Orano Canada Ltd. (Orano) ar e the operators of the current uranium \nproduction centres in Canada. Cameco is the owner and operator of the Rabbit Lake production \ncentre, which includes the Eagle Point mine and the Rabbit Lake mill. Cameco is also the operator of the McArthur River mine  and the Key Lake mill, which are joint ventures with Orano. Cameco \nis the majority owner and operator of the Cigar Lake mine, in which Orano, Idemitsu and the \nTokyo Electric Power Co. (TEPCO) have minority ownership.

Employment directly related to uranium production, including contract workers, was 831 in 201 8, 913 in 2019 and 746 in 2020. The \nreduced employment at the mine and mill sites in 2020 is primarily the result of only allowing essential staff to work at the sites during the COVID -19 pandemic.  \nFuture production centres  \nTwo uranium mining projects in S askatchewan that would feed existing mills could enter into \nproduction within the next decade should uranium prices increase. Ore from Orano’s proposed Midwest mine, which has received environmental approval, would provide additional feed for the \nMcClean L ake mill. Ore from Cameco’s proposed Millennium mine would be processed at the Key \nLake mill. Cameco has also identified other deposits (Fox Lake, Tamarack) that could feed existing \nmills.  \nSeveral other exploration projects in the Athabasca Basin have rece ntly identified large high -\ngrade uranium deposits that have the potential for development. In the western Athabasca Basin, the Arrow deposit (NexGen Energy Ltd.) is the world’s second -largest high -grade uranium deposit \n(130 000 tU) and a project to develop  an underground mine and a mill is currently undergoing an \nenvironmental assessment. The nearby Triple R deposit (Fission Uranium Corp.) is a high -grade \nuranium deposit (52  000 tU) which also has indicated and inferred gold resources totalling \nNATIONAL REPORTS: CANADA \nURANIUM 202 2: RESOURCES, PRODUCTION AND DEMAND, NEA No. 7634, ©  OECD 20 23 207 67 000 ounce s and has recently undergone a Pre -Feasibility Assessment for the development of an \nunderground mine. In the eastern Athabasca Basin, Denison Mines Corp.’s Phoenix deposit \n(26 900 tU) is undergoing an environmental assessment process for a proposal to deve lop an ISL \nmining operation. The Phoenix deposit is located in permeable sandstone above the unconformity \nand ground freezing is proposed in the sandstone overlying the deposit to create the confining \nconditions required for ISL operations. Denison Mines C orp.’s nearby Gryphon deposit (24  000 tU) \nhas the potential to be mined by conventional underground methods. In 2020, Denison conducted \na Preliminary Economic Assessment for mining the Heldeth Túé deposit (former name: J -Zone \ndeposit) at Waterbury Lake using ISL methods.  \nThere is also a possibility of mines being developed outside of Saskatchewan; however, \nuranium prices would have to increase substantially. Orano has proposed developing the Kiggavik and Sissons deposits in Nunavut, should market conditions  improve and mining \nbecomes economic.  \nSecondary sources of uranium  \nCanada does not use secondary sources of uranium. Canada does not produce or use mixed oxide fuels nor use re -enriched tails.  \nEnvironmental activities and socio -cultural issues  \nEnvironment al impact assessments  \nAs indicated above, environmental assessments are currently underway for proposals to develop \nthe Arrow deposit in the western Athabasca Basin and the Phoenix deposit in the eastern \nAthabasca Basin.  \nEffluent management  \nWater treatmen t and minor engineering works continued to be the main activities at the closed \nElliot Lake area uranium mine and mill sites in 2019 and 2020. Water quality within the Serpent River Watershed has improved since the closure and decommissioning of the mines and currently meets Ontario Drinking Water Standards.  \nSite rehabilitation  \nThe Cluff Lake mine, located in the western Athabasca Basin of Saskatchewan, ceased mining and milling operations in May 2002. A two- year decommissioning programme was initiated in 2 004, \nfollowing a five -year comprehensive environmental assessment study. Decommissioning was \nessentially completed by 2006, followed by revegetation. The remaining buildings were demolished in 2013 and access to the site is no longer restricted. Orano cond ucts monitoring of \nthe site every quarter.  \nIn northern Saskatchewan, several mines (principally the Gunnar and Lorado mines) were \noperated from the late 1950s to early 1960s by private sector companies that no longer exist. \nWhen the sites were closed, ther e were no regulatory requirements in place to appropriately \ncontain and treat the waste, which has led to environmental impacts on local soils and lakes. \nThe responsibility for these sites is now held by the government of Saskatchewan and a project is curr ently underway to remediate these sites.  \nUranium requirements  \nIn 2020, nuclear energy provided about 15% of Canada’s total electricity needs (including \napproximately 60% in Ontario and 40% in New Brunswick) and is expected to contin ue to play \nan important role in supplying Canada with electricity in the future. Canada has a fleet of \n19 CANDU pressurised heavy water reactors, of which 17 are currently in full commercial \nNATIONAL REPORTS: CANADA  \n208 URA NIUM 202 2: RESOURCES, PRODUCTION AND DEMAND, NEA No. 7634, © OECD 202 3 operation (16 in Ontario and 1 in New Brunswick). Two reactors in  Ontario (Darlington unit 3 \nand Bruce Power unit 6) were taken out of service in 2020 for refurbishment and are expected \nto return to service in 2023 -2024. Two reactors in Ontario (Pickering 2 and 3) and one reactor in \nQuebec (Gentilly -2) have been shut do wn permanently for decommissioning.  \nIn Canada, the responsibility for deciding on the energy supply mix and investments in \nelectricity generation capacity, including the planning, construction and operation of nuclear \npower plants, resides with the provin ces and their provincial power utilities.  \nCanada’s CANDU nuclear reactors are designed to provide electricity generation for about 25 -\n30 years. Through “refurbishment” (replacement of key reactor and station components), \ncontinued operation of the reactor s can be extended for approximately 30 additional years. \nRefurbishment projects in New Brunswick (Point Lepreau) and Ontario (Bruce A units 1 and 2) have been completed and the reactors returned to service in the fall of 2012. More recently, as laid out \nin Ontario’s 2013 Long- term Energy Plan, refurbishment of the first Darlington unit began in \nOctober 2016 and was completed on schedule in June 2020. Refurbishment of the second \nDarlington unit began in September 2020 with all four Darlington units expected to be refurbished \nby 2026 as planned and within budget. Similarly, the first Bruce unit refurbishment began in \nJanuary 2020 and all six Bruce units are expected to be refurbished by 2033.  \nThe Pickering Nuclear Generating Station, Ontario’s first commercial -scale nuclear power \nplant, will not be refurbished once it reaches the end of its safe operating life. In 2018, approval \nwas given for the continued operation of Pickering up to 2024.  \nIn 2012, Canada’s nuclear regulator, the Canadian Nuclear Safety Commi ssion (CNSC), \ngranted a site preparation licence for a nuclear new build at Darlington following approval of \nthe environmental assessment. The licence is valid for ten  years and the CNSC is currently \nconsidering an application to renew the licence, with th e intention that the site be prepared for \nuse as a demonstration of small modular reactor (SMR) technology. An SMR demonstration is \nalso being considered at another site in Chalk River Ontario, located at Canada’s nuclear \nlaboratories, pending the licence to prepare the site.  \nIn December 2020, the Minister of Natural Resources announced the release of Canada’s SMR \nAction Plan, which was developed in partnership with more than 100 organisations, including \nseven provincial and territorial governments (Alberta , Saskatchewan, Ontario, New Brunswick, \nPrince Edward Island, Yukon, Nunavut), municipalities, utilities, industry, civil society, academia \nand some Indigenous voices. The Action Plan outlines progress and ongoing efforts by these \norganisations to support the development and deployment of SMRs, while responding to and \ngoing beyond recommendations in Canada’s SMR Roadmap. In 2021, NRCan will continue to advance priorities outlined in the Government of Canada chapter of the Action Plan together with \npartners from across the government.  \nIn December 2019, the Provinces of Alberta, Ontario, Saskatchewan and New Brunswick \nsigned a memorandum of understanding to advance the demonstration and deployment of SMRs \nin Canada. The Province of Alberta formally became a s ignatory in April 2021. These provinces \nhave agreed to collaborate on the advancement of SMRs as a clean energy option to address \nclimate change and regional energy demands, while simultaneously supporting economic growth \nand innovation.  \nSupply and procure ment strategy  \nApproximately 1  700 tU of Canada’s uranium production is used domestically to generate \nnuclear power. The nuclear utilities fill uranium requirements through long -term contracts and \nperiodic spot market purchases.  \nNATIONAL REPORTS: CANADA \nURANIUM 202 2: RESOURCES, PRODUCTION AND DEMAND, NEA No. 7634, ©  OECD 20 23 209 Uranium policies, uranium stocks and uranium prices  \nNational policies relating to uranium  \nThe Nuclear Fuel Waste Act (NFWA), which came into force on 15  November 2002, requires \nnuclear energy corporations to establish a Nuclear Waste Management Organization ( NWMO) \nto manage nuclear fuel waste safely and securely over the long term.  \nAdaptive phased management (APM) was chosen as Canada’s approach for safely managing \nnuclear fuel waste over the long term. APM involves the containment and isolation of nuclear fue l \nwaste in a deep geological repository. The APM approach recognises that people benefiting from \nnuclear energy produced today must take steps to ensure that the wastes are dealt with \nresponsibly and without unduly burdening future generations. At the same  time, it is sufficiently \nflexible to adapt to changing social and technological developments. APM is implemented by the \nNWMO, using funds provided by the owners of nuclear fuel waste.  \nThe NWMO has developed a siting process to identify an informed, willin g host community \nwith a safe, secure and suitable site for a deep geological repository. This nine -step siting \nprocess was collaboratively designed, refined and finalised through an iterative two- year public \nengagement and consultation process. In May 2010 , the NWMO initiated the siting process with \nan invitation to communities to learn more about the APM project and the plan to safely manage the waste. By the end of 2014, the NWMO had actively engaged with 21 communities in Ontario \nand Saskatchewan, includ ing First Nations and Métis communities that had expressed an \ninterest in hosting the waste management facility. The ultimate success of the project depends upon community engagement and lasting partnerships.  \nIn November 2019, the NWMO selection process w as narrowed down to two potential siting \nareas: the Township of Ignace (north -western  Ontario) and the Township of Huron -Kinloss/ \nMunicipality of South Bruce (southern Ontario). Detailed fieldwork to address the scientific and technical aspects, as well as  the social dimensions of site selection, will proceed over the next \nseveral years. Field studies, borehole drilling, airborne surveys, environmental mapping, socio -\neconomic studies and other assessments will be carried out to determine the suitability of sites \nand the willingness of communities. The NWMO will continue to build and strengthen its \nworking relationships with participating communities as this process advances.  \nThe Nuclear Liability and Compensation Act (NLCA), which entered into force on 1  January \n2017, replacing the Nuclear Liability Act of 1976, strengthens Canada’s nuclear liability regime. \nIt establishes the compensation and civil liability regime to address damages in the extremely \nunlikely event of a nuclear incident at a Canadian nuclear  installation. It also enables Canada’s \nimplementation of the IAEA Convention on Supplementary Compensation for Nuclear Damage. \nBy being a member of the Convention, Canada commits to harmonising its nuclear liability \nprinciples with those of other member c ountries and provides compensation for civil damages \nin other member countries resulting from a nuclear accident in Canada. Reciprocally, another \nmember country would provide compensation for civil damages resulting from a nuclear accident in that country.  The Convention also provides for the establishment of a pool of funds \nthat would be available in the event of an accident, should it be required, to compensate for damage in countries that are members of the Convention.  \nThe NLCA embodies the principles of  absolute and exclusive liability of the operator, \nmandatory insurance and limitations on the operator’s liability in both time and amount. Under the NLCA, the operator of a nuclear power plant is  responsible to pay up to CAD  1 billion for civil \ndamages re sulting from an accident at that plant. The Act also established that the existing \nCAD  1 billion liability limit for nuclear installations must be reassessed at least once every five \nyears and based on the assessment, the Government of Canada may increase the amount by regulation. The first review of the NLCA liability limit was undertaken in 2021.  \n  \nNATIONAL REPORTS: CANADA  \n210 URA NIUM 202 2: RESOURCES, PRODUCTION AND DEMAND, NEA No. 7634, © OECD 202 3 Uranium stocks  \nThe Canadian government does not maintain any stocks of natural uranium and data for \nproducers and utilities are not available.

d Atomic Energy Commission (CEA) was the first organisation \nto prospect for uranium in the Central African Republic. Initial reconnaissance work \ncommenced in 1947 and exploration of the extensive zones of crystalline formations which \nborder the west and oc cupy the centre of the country was conducted without success. In 1956, \nprospecting using improved techniques and benefiting from improved knowledge of uranium \nmetallogeny was extended to the detrital siliceous series of the Middle Precambrian -Upper \nPrecamb rian (Nbafkl and Fouroumbala Series). A major radiometric anomaly was discovered in \nthe N’zako laterites, but importantly, a significant geological similarity was noted between the \nFouroumbala Series and Franceville in Gabon, where a uranium deposit had be en discovered. \nEncouraged by this similarity, the CEA intensified its exploration in 1959 with a systematic \nprogramme of aerial prospecting, covering the entire eastern region of the country, an area of \naround 50 000  km². This work led, in 1961, to the dis covery of the country’s first uranium deposit \nnear the town of Bakouma. Three deposits were discovered. Geologically, the host is a uranium -\nbearing phosphatic formation of the Eocene age. The notable feature is the exceptionally high \nuranium content for a formation of this type. In 1963, the CEA and the Compagnie Française des \nMinéraux d’Uranium (CFMU) formed a syndicate to continue exploration and to study the feasibility of mining the deposit. A jointly owned mining company, the Bakouma Uranium \nMining Com pany (URBA), was set up in 1969 between the state and the CEA and CFMU \npartnership. However, the result of the feasibility study on the mining of the deposit was \nunfavourable, as the phosphatic nature of the ore made it difficult to develop a suitable \nproc essing method, and activities by URBA ceased in 1971.  \nAfter the oil crisis in the winter of 1973 -1974, numerous foreign companies showed interest \nin the Bakouma deposit, and Aluminium Suisse S.A. of Zurich resumed studies on the mining \nof the deposit. In F ebruary 1975, a new mining company (URCA, Central African Uranium \nCompany) was set up between Aluminium Suisse and the three original partners of URBA. \nProspecting conducted by the Atomic Energy Commission, URBA, and URCA used the following \nmethods: (a) ge ological investigation and cartography; (b) airborne radiometric surveys; \n(c) ground radiometric surveys; (d) ground verification of selected anomalous zones; (e) drilling \nof boreholes at different spacing intervals; (f) geochemical analysis of soil, water  and alluvial \nsediments. However, subsequent technical, metallurgical, and economic studies indicated that \nthe deposits were not economically viable at the then prevailing price of uranium, and in 1978 \nthe project was terminated.  \nIn May 2006, UraMin Inc. w as granted one mining permit and two research permits for the \nexploration of uranium mineralisation in the Bakouma region. Reverse circulation percussion \ndrilling commenced at the Patricia deposit in August 2006 to confirm the presence of uranium \nmineralis ation and to increase the known resource. Initial drilling of 66 holes on a 100  m × 50  m \ngrid spacing delineated the extent of the Patricia deposit. Data from these holes were used as \nthe basis for the resource estimate. Reverse circulation infill drilling  on a 50  m × 50  m grid \nspacing commenced and a diamond drilling campaign to acquire additional geological and geotechnical information was also planned. Further reverse circulation and diamond drilling were planned at the other deposits that comprise the B akouma project.  \n                                                      \n*  Report prepared by the NEA/IAEA, based on previous Red Books and company reports.  \nNATI ONAL REPORTS: CENTRAL AFRICAN REPUBLIC  \n216 URA NIUM 202 2: RESOURCES, PRODUCTION AND DEMAND, NEA No. 7634, © OECD 202 3 On 30 July 2007, the owner of Bakouma and other African uranium deposits, UraMin Inc., \nwas acquired by A reva (now Orano) for USD  2.5 billion. This transaction gave Areva a 90% \ninterest in the project, with a 10% carried interest retained b y the state. The start -up of the \nBakouma pilot project was planned for 2010. In June 2012, gunmen attacked the Bakouma \nproject site and since then all activities have been suspended.  \nRecent and ongoing uranium exploration and mine development activities  \nThere has been no recent exploration and mining development for uranium in the Central \nAfrican Republic.  \nUranium resources  \nThe uranium mineralisation of the Bakouma Basin is associated with phosphate lenses \nintercalated with silts and siliceous horizons. It  is these lenses that have the highest \nconcentrations of uranium mineralisation and they are grouped into several deposits: Palmyre, \nPama, Pamela, Pâquerette, Patou and Patricia, which make up the greater Bakouma deposit.  \nIdentified conventional resources  \nIn its 2020 annual report, Orano reported the results of a new resource evaluation that shows \ninferred in situ resources amounting to 36  475 tU at an average grade of 0.20 %U.  \nIn previous Red Book editions, the Central African Republic reported 42 200 tU a s RAR in  situ \nresources, in the < USD 260 cost category.  \nUnconventional resources  \nThe Central African Republic does not report unconventional resources. While the Bakouma \nuranium deposit is associated with phosphates, it is classified as a conventional dep osit because \nof the relatively high (0.15 -0.30% U) uranium grade.  \nUranium production  \nThe start -up of the Bakouma pilot project was planned for 2010.  It aimed to start open -pit mining \nat 1 200 tU/yr . At full capacity, the mine would have produced 2 000 tU p er year. The A reva group \nsuspended the uranium mining project at the end of 2011 for one to two years due to low uranium \nprices and the need for further research on the metallurgy.

Following a \ndelay of about ten years, activities were renewed in 1970 by the Spanish Nuclear Ener gy \nOrganisation, focusing for four years on Region  IV of the Tambillos mining district.  \nBetween 1976 and 1990, regional prospecting encompassing an area of 150  000 km2 was \nconducted in co -operation with the International Atomic Energy Agency using geochemical \ndrainage surveys, aerial radiometry, ground -based geology and radiometry. This work led to the \ndetection of 1  800 aerial anomalies, 2  000 geochemical and radiometric anomalies and the \ndefinition of 120  sectors of interest. Subsequent investigation of 84 of these sectors of interest \nled to the identification of 80  uranium occurrences, stimulating further study of the 12 most \npromising prospects, preliminary exploration of these prospects, and eventually the evaluation of uranium resources as a by- product  of copper and phosphate mining.  \nFrom 1980 to 1984, Cía Minera Pudahuel (the Pudahuel Mining Company), in co -operation with \nthe Chilean Nuclear Energy Commission (CCHEN), conducted drilling of the Sagasca Cu -U deposit, \nRegion  I (Tarapacá), leading to a tec hnical and economic evaluation of the Huinquintipa copper \ndeposit, Region  I. The Production Development Corporation (Corporación de Fomento de la \nProducción – CORFO) and the CCHEN conducted exploration and technical economic evaluation \nof the Bahía Inglesa phosphorite deposit, Region  III (Atacama), in 1986 and 1987.  \nBetween 1990 and 1996, the CCHEN undertook geological and metallogenic uranium research, \nmainly in the north of the country. From 1996 to 1999, the CCHEN and the National Mining Company of Chile  (ENAMI) investigated REE in relation to radioactive minerals in the Atacama and \nCoquimbo regions. Dozens of primary occurrences were studied, with the “Diego de Almagro” Anomaly- 2 chosen as a priority. The study of this 180  km\n2 sector found disseminations and veins \nof davidite, ilmenite, magnetite, sphene, rutile and anatase, with 3.5 to 4.0 kg/t of REE oxides (REO), \n0.3 to 0.4 kg/t of U and 20  to 80  kg/t of Ti. The geological resources of the ore contained in this \nprospect were estimated at 12 000 000 t. The metallurgical recovery of REO from these minerals \nwas also considered during an investigation of mining resources with economic potential in the medium term.  \nIn 1998 and 1999, the CCHEN created the National Uranium Potential Evaluation Project, \nencompa ssing the activities of uranium metallogeny research and development of a geological \ndatabase. The aim of this project was to set up a portfolio of research projects to improve the evaluation of national uranium ore potential. Between 2000 and 2002, a prel iminary geological \nevaluation for uranium and REO of the Cerro Carmen prospect (2000 -2002), located in Region  III \n(Atacama), was completed as part of the specific co- operation agreement between the CCHEN and \nENAMI. Geophysical exploration work was undertak en (magnetometry, resistivity and \nchargeability), defining targets with metallic sulphur minerals with uranium and associated REE.  \nIn 2001, a project portfolio document was developed that updated the metallogeny and \ngeological favourability for uranium in Chile. A total of 166  research projects were proposed, \nranging from regional activities to detailed scientific studies, to be undertaken sequentially in \n                                                      \n*  Report prepared by the NEA/IAEA, based on previous Red Books, government data and company reports.  \nNATIONAL REPORTS: CHILE  \n218 URA NIUM 202 2: RESOURCES, PRODUCTION AND DEMAND, NEA No. 7634, © OECD 202 3 accordance with the CCHEN capacities. In the extractive metallurgy area, work has been \nongoing since 19 96, through a co -operation agreement between the CCHEN and ENAMI, to \ndevelop processes to produce commercial concentrates of rare earths. High purity concentrates \nof light REE, as well as yttrium, have been obtained.  \nIn 2003, regional reconnaissance was un dertaken for uranium and REE in Region  I of the \ncountry, after which the CCHEN -ENAMI co -operation agreement was terminated. Through 2004, \ndatabase work was continued by the CCHEN, and commercial services were provided to the \nmining industry through 2010.  \nFrom 2008 to 2012, the CCHEN completed a broad scope co- operation agreement with the \nNational Copper Corporation (CODELCO Norte) for geological and metallurgical investigation of \nnatural radioactive material occurrences.

Studies need to be done to validate or eliminate these figures.  \n1.  The Sagasca deposit is exhausted, the Cascada deposit (continuation of the mineralised body) is practically exhausted; however, new explorations \nin the area have found new mineralised bodies, so the figure could vary substantially.  \n2.  Huinquintipa currently forms part of the Collahuasi Project, a contractual mining company belonging to Anglo American Plc and Xstrata Copper, \na division of the Swiss mining company Xstrata Plc,  each of which has a 44% stake. The remaining 12% belongs to JCR, a consortium of Japanese \ncompanies led by Mitsui & Co., Ltd. The oxidised mineral reserves amount to 53  million tonnes, for which copper extraction and production began \nin 2000 and will last  for 20  years. The figures shown in the foregoing table could rise by a factor of between 10 and 20.  \n3.  Chuqui Sur: Although this deposit is not exhausted, the surcharge makes it expensive to operate, so the uranium resources con tributed to the \nChuquicama ta Division oxides plant could be zero. Accordingly, the figures indicated above could decrease significantly.  \n4.  Quebrada Ichuno, has not been studied and there are only preliminary works, so the figure mentioned above is maintained.  \n5.  The uranium reso urces assigned to the El Tesoro mine correspond to preliminary geological reconnaissance data obtained in 1983. This deposit is \ncurrently a nationally important mining centre, 70% owned by Antofagasta Minerals S.A., which belongs to Antofagasta Plc, and  30% owned by \nthe Marubeni Corporation of Japan. Its mineral reserves amount to 186  million tonnes, with a useful life of 21  years. Preliminary samples suggest \nuranium contents of between 5 and 200  ppm, with an average of between 15 and 20  ppm. Investigating this uranium source could change the \nfigure indicated above substantially.  \n6.  The “Chuquicamata Norte” prospect currently corresponds to the Radomiro Tomic mining centre, with reserves of 970  million tonnes of minerals \nthat could be leached from copper an d a useful life of 22  years. A programme of activities is currently being developed to recover uranium and \nmolybdenum.  \n7.  Estimations performed in the 1970s assigned a potential of 1  000 tU that could be recovered from copper leaching solutions obtained f rom the \ngravels of the old oxides plant of the Chuquicamata copper mine. This project began its activities in 1998 and will be active for 12  years. By the end \nof the period it will produce 467  000 t of fine copper. Recovery of uranium from these leaching s olutions has not been researched.  \nIn addition to the uranium resources present in the leaching solutions from the aforementioned mines, there are other large c opper deposits in \nthe large- scale mining sector, whose leaching solutions have not been researche d. An example is El Abra. This deposit, owned by Phelps Dodge \nMining Co (51%) and CODELCO Chile (49%), started production of 800  million tonnes of is copper minerals for a 17 -year period.  \n8.  These figures have historical value only and as geological backg round data. The low copper content of these districts and the small volume of their \nreserves makes it difficult to recover their uranium content.  \n9.  No experiments have been done to recover uranium from the uranium content in marine phosphorites. The only  deposit currently being exploited \nis Bahía Inglesa, in Region III (Atacama), which produces a solid phosphate concentrate of direct use as fertiliser. In  2001, Compañía Minera de \nFosfatos Naturales Ltda., (BIFOX LTDA.), which operates the aforementioned mine, began producing phosphoric acid, which would make it possible to recover uranium from the mother solutions.  \nNATIONAL REPORTS: CHILE  \n222 URA NIUM 202 2: RESOURCES, PRODUCTION AND DEMAND, NEA No. 7634, © OECD 202 3 Unconventional resources and other materials  \n(in situ tonnes U)  \nDeposit  RAR  IR PR SR % U  Mineral  \nUnconventional  1 798  0 1 818  3 640  0.0008 -0.1 Leaching solution 7 to 15  g/m3 \nOxide plants gravel  \nCu silicate and oxides, 20 -70 ppm  \nSulphur oxide veins of 500 -1 000 ppm  \nTotal  1 798  0 1 818  3 640    \nSpeculative resources in uranium geological favourable areas  \nGrowing knowledge of the distribution of u ranium mineralisation in Chile has made it possible \nto define four areas of uranium occurrence and seven favourable areas, five of which have \noccurrences of uranium, collectively accounting for potential resources of 3  300 tU. \nAreas of uranium occurrences,  accounting for ~1  350 tU: \n1.

The regional alignment that controls the mineralisation of this prospect extends 60  km to the north -west. This structure, \nvisible in satellite images, involves other mining districts for which a potential of 1 500 tU of speculative resources is assigned.  \n3.  In 1999- 2000, data held by the CCHEN was reviewed as part of the National Uranium Potential Evaluation Project. It was concluded that  the acidic \nand intermediate volcanism present in a broad area of the  Main Cordillera stretching from regions  I to III constituted an inclined plane dipping \ntowards the west, ending in a lagoon environment situated in a central depression, with a similar condition occurring to the east. This volcanism \ncovered the pre- volcan ic landscape, preserving the surface drainage courses (now paleochannels). The leaching of these volcanic rocks \ncontributed large amounts of uranium into the lagoon systems, paleochannels and other structures in which solutions circulate. This process is represented by extensive layers of calcilutites, diatomites (Pampa Camarones), layers of salt (Salar Grande), argillites, limestones, limolites and \nvolcanic ash (Quillagua, Prosperidad, Quebrada Amarga, Chiu Chiu), with uranium contents ranging between 100 and 1  000 ppm. These uranium \noccurrences and mineralisations have been classified historically as “surface deposits”. There are also paleochannels with copper and associated uranium (the Sagasca, Cascada, Huinquintipa, Quebrada Ichuno, Chuqui Sur, El Tesor o deposits and others). Within the volcanic area, uranium \nmineralisation (torbernite and autunite) has been discovered in volcanic structures containing iron (El Laco and El Perro). T his environment is \nconsidered to have great potential and requires furthe r research. In structures associated with the U mineralisation indicated above, 500  tU is \nassigned as EAR -II (now prognosticated).  \nUranium production  \nHistorical review  \nThe uranium present in copper oxide ores could be recovered from the leaching solutions.  A pilot -\nlevel trial was conducted in the Chuquicamata Division between 1976 and 1979, obtaining 0.5 t of \nyellow cake from copper -rich solutions containing 10 to 15  ppm  U (0.001 to 0.0015%  U), which was \nsent for purification at the CCHEN metallurgy pilot p lant at the Lo Aguirre nuclear centre. The \nproduction of copper oxide minerals has quadrupled in Chile over the last decade.  \nThe copper mining industry, particularly large -scale mining, has strategic (sub -economic) \nuranium potential in the large volumes of  copper oxide leaching solutions. These resources are \nassigned a potential of 1  000 tU in mining centres not included in the previous table. However, no \nbackground studies have been performed to confirm these figures, either as mining resources or \nin terms  of the volumes of solutions treated annually, so the information should be treated as \nunverified. Over the last decade, private firms, both domestic and foreign, have explored \n12 “exotic copper” deposits in Chile, which correspond to paleochannels filled with gravel, \nmineralised with copper silicates, oxides and sulphates as a result of the natural leaching of \nporphyry copper deposits or other contribution areas. These mineralised bodies contain variable uranium contents ranging between 7 and 116 ppm (0.00 7 to 0.016%  U). The leaching solutions in \nthe plants that treat these copper oxide minerals display uranium levels of up to 10  ppm. This \nuranium content is technically recoverable using ion -exchange resins, at a likely production cost \nof over USD  80/kgU.  \nNATIONAL REPORTS: CHILE  \n224 URA NIUM 202 2: RESOURCES, PRODUCTION AND DEMAND, NEA No. 7634, © OECD 202 3 There has been no experience in recovering uranium from phosphorites in Chile. The only \ndeposit currently being worked is Bahía Inglesa in Region III (Atacama), which produces a solid \nphosphate concentrate used directly as fertiliser. In 2001, Compañía Mine ra de Fosfatos Naturales \nLtda. (Bifox Ltda.) began producing phosphoric acid from this deposit, opening the potential of \nrecovering uranium from the acid.  \nStatus of production capability and recent and ongoing activities  \nOther than the trial production mentioned above, no uranium has been produced in Chile.  \nEnvironmental activities and socio -cultural issues  \nThe CCHEN runs a permanent programme to disseminate information on peaceful uses of \nnuclear energy, attached to the Office of Dissemination and Public R elations (Oficina de Difusión \ny Relaciones Públicas).  \nRegulatory regime \nIn Chile, there is no regulatory framework for uranium production cycle activities.  \nUranium requirements  \nChile has achieved significant technological development in the manufacture of MTR -type \n(materials test reactor) combustible elements, based on U 3Si2 (uranium silicide). In March 1998, \nthe manufacture of 47  combustible elements began at the CCHEN combustible elements plant, \nending in 2004. For this work, 60 kg of metallic uranium was  purchased from Russia, enriched \nto 19.75% in 235U, covering uranium requirements up to the indicated date.

Prior to the 1990s, uranium \nexploration mainly focused on granite -related or volcanic -related hydrothermal deposits in \nJiangxi, Hunan, Guangdong and Guangxi in South China. Over four decades, exploration by the \nBureau of Geolo gy (BOG), a subsidiary of the China National Nuclear Corporation (CNNC), \nresulted in the identification of most of the ore fields (deposits), such as Xiangshan, Xiazhuang, \nZhuguang, Ujing and Miaoershan. Except for a few large deposits, most are relatively  small and \ntypically mid - to low -grade. Additionally, the deposits are mostly located in remote mountain \nareas, so mining costs are high.  \nAt the beginning of the 1990s, when China initiated its nuclear energy programme, domestic \ndemand for uranium increase d very little due to the small number of nuclear power plants. Given \nthat there was an oversupply of natural uranium in the international market during that period, China slowed its uranium exploration activities and drastically cut its uranium exploration  \nexpenditures . \nIn the late 1990s, as nuclear power plant construction in China accelerated, domestic demand \nfor uranium steadily increased. Since then, year -over -year national expenditures on uranium \nexploration gradually increased, and the targets shifted  from conventional hard rock mining in \nSouthern China to in situ leaching (ISL) sandstone -type deposits in Meso -Cenozoic sedimentary \nbasins in northern China, such as in the Yili, Turpan- Hami, Junggar, Erlian, Erdos and Songliao \nBasins. From 2000 to 2006, a nnual drilling gradually increased from 40  000 m to 250 000 m. Since \n2006, investment in uranium exploration increased, with drilling peaking at 900  000 m in 2012.  \nIn addition to the CNNC, which has been the major organisation involved in uranium \nexplorat ion in China, the China National Petroleum Corporation (CNPC) also carried out uranium \nexploration in Tongliao, Inner Mongolia, in the late 1990s. Since 2008, Uranium Resources Co. Ltd, \na subsidiary of the China General Nuclear Power Corporation (CGN), has  also been active in \ndomestic uranium exploration and has carried out related activities along the northern margin of Tarim Basin, Xinjiang and in Guangdong Province.  \nDomestic uranium exploration continued in 2017 and 2018 with positive results. The \nexplor ation focused on sandstone -type uranium deposits in north China, where resources were \nexpanded in the Erdos, Yili and Songliao Basins. Uranium mineralisation was discovered in new \nareas in the Songliao, Jung gar and Erlian Basins. Preliminary exploration in dicates that these \nareas have high potential.  Progress has also been made in the exploration of the deeper parts \nand periphery of the known uranium ore fields in south China.  \nExploration, including regional uranium potential assessments and further work on  \npreviously discovered mineralisation and deposits in northern China, has principally been \nfocused on medium to large sedimentary basins, including the Yili, Turpan -Hami, Junggar and \nTarim Basins in the Xinjiang Autonomous Region; the Erdos, Erlian, Songliao, Badanjili and \nBayingebi Basins in Inner Mongolia; the Caidamu Basin in Qinghai Province and the Jiuquan \nBasin in Gansu Province. Geologic surveys, radiometric surveys, and electromagnetic surveys \n                                                      \n*  Report prepared by the NEA/IAEA based on previous Red Books, available public information and \nNEA/IAEA estimates.  \nNATIONAL REPORTS: CHINA (PEOPLE’S REPUBLIC OF)  \n228 URA NIUM 202 2: RESOURCES, PRODUCTION AND DEMAND, NEA No. 7634, © OECD 202 3 were combined with a moderate amount of drilling and sha llow seismic methods to delineate \nprospects for further investigations. Further drilling was carried out in mineralised areas to \nidentify ISL sandstone -type deposits, as well as sandstone/mudstone -type deposits with low \npermeability to be exploited by conv entional mining.  \nExploration in Southern China is mainly directed at identifying metallogenic belts relating to \nvolcanic -related and granite -related deposit types, mostly distributed in the Xiangshan uranium \nore field in Jiangxi Province, the Xiazhuang and  Zhuguang uranium ore fields in Guangdong \nProvince, and the Miaoershan uranium ore field in the Guangxi Autonomous Region . \nThe total drilling completed in 2017 and 2018 amounted to about 610 000 m and 580 000 m, \nrespectively. As a result, uranium resources  in sedimentary basins in northern China, such as \nthe Yili, Erdos, Erlian and  Songliao Basins, have increased. In Southern China, there have been \nsmall increases of uranium resources in the deeper parts and on the periphery of the Xiangshan, \nMiaoershan , Zhuguangnanbu and Xiazhuang uranium ore fields.  \nRecent and ongoing uranium exploration and mine development activities  \nNo public information on recent domestic uranium exploration activities and expenditures in \nChina is available for 2019 and 2020. For the p urposes of this report, it is assumed that exploration \ncontinued at a similar pace as in 2018 within sedimentary basins in northern China and Inner \nMongolia, and continued to be focused on new resource estimates related to sandstone -type ISL \namenable depos its. See the 2020 edition of the Red Book for domestic and non -domestic uranium \nexploration and development expenditures as of 1  January 2019.  \nUranium resources  \nIdentified conventional resources (reasonably assured and inferred resources)  \nAs of 1 January 2 021, identified in situ uranium resources in China totalled 339  500 tU, including \n154 470 tU reasonably assured resources (RAR) and 185 030 tU inferred resources, assuming that \nno new resources have been discovered since the end of 2018. Compared to the 2020 edition, \nthere is a slight decrease in RAR resources by 4 500 tU due to mining depletion in 2019 and 2020. \nInferred resources have remained unchanged from 2019. Approximately 58% of all identified resources are amenable for ISL mining and 55% belong to the cost category of <USD 80/kgU. In this cost category, 91% of the resources are amenable to ISL mining and the rest for conventional underground mining.   \nThe following table shows the distribution of uranium resources over 21  uranium ore fields, \nbasins a nd deposits in 13  provinces or autonomous regions as of 1 January 2019. It has not been \nupdated due to the lack of public information on recent exploration activities and mining depletion in 2019 and 2020.  \nUndiscovered conventional resources (prognosticate d and speculative resources)  \nChina has conducted systematic nationwide uranium resource prediction and evaluation with \nprognosticated resources estimated to amount to around 2  million  tU. Favourable target areas \nfor uranium mineralisation include the Erlia n, Erdos, Tarim, Junggar, and Songliao Basins in \nnortheast China, and the periphery at the depth of the known uranium deposits in Southern \nChina. With further exploration in uranium metallogenetic prospective area s, more uranium \nresources are expected to b e discovered . \nUnconventional resources and other materials  \nThere are unconventional uranium resources associated with phosphate rocks  in China, mainly \ndistributed in Hunan, Guizhou and Sichuan Provinces . The grade is relatively low.  Systematic \nappraisal of  unconventional uranium resources has not yet been conducted.  \nNATIONAL REPORTS: CHINA (PEOPLE’S REPUBLIC OF)  \nURANIUM 202 2: RESOURCES, PRODUCTION AND DEMAND, NEA No. 7634, ©  OECD 20 23 229 Province  Ore field / basin / deposit  Deposit types  Resources tU,  \nas of 01.01.2019 \nJiangxi  Xiangshan orefield  Volcanic -related and granite -related  26 200  \nGanzhou orefield  Volcanic -related and  granite -related  28 900  \nTaoshan orefield  Granite -related  8 000  \nGuangdong  Xiazhuang orefield  Granite -related  11 600  \nZhuguangnanbu orefield  Granite -related  19 700  \nHeyuanbei deposit  Granite -related  2 300  \nHunan  Xiangcaodawan orefield  Granite -related  7 600 \nGuangxi  Chanziping deposit  (Ziyuan site)  Black shales  9 500  \nXinjiang  Yili basin  Sandstone  42 700  \nTuha basin  Sandstone  10 100  \nInner \nMongolia  Erdos basin  Sandstone  80 100  \nErlian basin  Sandstone  52 100  \nTongliao basin  Sandstone  16 500  \nBayingebi basin  Sandstone  7 500  \nHebei  Qinglong orefield  Volcanic -related  6 700  \nYunnan  Chengzishan deposit (Tengchong site)  Sandstone  4 300  \nShaanxi  Lantian deposit  Granite -related  1 200  \nGansu  Guangshigou deposit (Longshoushan site)  Intrusive  1 450  \nZhejiang  Dach ayuan deposit  (Dazhou site)  Volcanic -related  2 100  \nLiaoning  Lianshanguan deposit (Benxi site)  Metasomatite  350 \nSichuan  Zhajiang deposit  (Ruoergai site)  Black shales  5 100  \nTotal (in situ)  344 000  \nUranium production  \nHistorical review  \nThe nearly 60 -year h istory of China’s natural uranium production include s a boom in the first \ntwo decades and a decline from the late 1980s to the 1990s. In the early 2000s, there was a surge \nin activity, driven principally by the ambitious new nuclear power plant construction \nprogramme announced by the Chinese government and the increase in uranium spot price at \nthat time. As a result, uranium production was reinvigorated.  \nAs domestic uranium demand is projected to increase rapidly in the coming decades, China \naccelerated the  pace of domestic uranium mining  to ensure uranium supply . Several existing  \nuranium production centres, such as Fuzhou and Yining, expanded their capacity to achieve \nboth stable and increased production . Additionally , to promote uranium production, the \ndevelopment of other new uranium production centres based on uranium deposits with reliable  \nreserves  and favourable technological/economic feasibilities , such as the Tongliao  production \ncentre , was also accelerated. Finally , to construct new uranium productio n centres in the future, \na series of pilot tests and feasibility studies  were carried out on some new ly discovered ISL -\namenable sandstone uranium deposits with abundant reserves, such as the sandstone -type \nuranium deposits in the Erdos and Erlian  Basins . \n  \nNATIONAL REPORTS: CHINA (PEOPLE’S REPUBLIC OF)  \n230 URA NIUM 202 2: RESOURCES, PRODUCTION AND DEMAND, NEA No. 7634, © OECD 202 3 Uranium production centre technical details  \n(as of 1  January 2021 ) \n Centre #1  Centre #2  Centre #3  Centre #4  Centre #5  Centre #6  \nName of production centre  Fuzhou  Chongyi  Yining  Lantian  Shaoguan  Tongliao  \nProduction centre classification  Existing  Idled  Existing  Idled  Existing  Existing  \nDate of first production  1966  1979  1993  1993  1967  2015  \nSource of ore :       \nDeposit name(s)     Lantian    \nDeposit type(s)  Volcanic  Granite  Sandstone  Granite  Granite  Sandstone  \nResources (tU)  NA NA NA NA NA NA \nGrade (% U ) NA NA NA NA NA NA \nMining op eratio n:       \nType (OP/UG/ISL)  UG UG ISL UG UG ISL \nSize (tonnes ore/day)  1 000  600 NA 300 650 NA \nAverage mining recovery ( %) 92 90 NA 80 90 NA \nProcessing plant:        \nAcid/alkaline  Acid  Acid  Acid  Acid  Acid  CO 2+O 2* \nType (IX /SX)  IX IX IX IX IX IX \nSize (tonnes ore/day);  \nfor ISL (l/day or l/h)  1 000  600 NA NA NA NA \nAverage process recovery (% ) 90 84 NA 90 90 NA \nNominal production capacity ( tU/year ) 350 0 850 0 200 200 \nPlans for expansion  NA NA NA NA NA NA \nOther remarks  NA NA NA NA NA NA \n* Considered a form of alkaline in situ leaching by some countries, as CO 2+O 2 ISL is alkaline at the beginning of the process, then neutral \nor slightly acidic at the end.  \nStatus of production capability  \nIn response to a sustained decline i n uranium prices and to meet the environmental goals \nannounced by the Chinese government, Chinese uranium companies reorganised from 2017 to \n2018. First, several underground hard rock  uranium mines with depleted uranium resources or \nwith high production cos ts were either closed or saw production suspended (idled). Second, the \nmining of ISL sandstone uranium deposits in northern China continued, including the \nexpansion of ISL production capacity in Xinjiang and Inner Mongolia. As a result, a domestic \nuranium industry focused on production dominated by ISL mining in northern China, \nsupplemented by underground mining in Southern China, has emerged. The overall capacity of uranium production has remained steady after the reorganisation.  \nOf the seven  production ce ntres established in China by 2015, the Fuzhou and Shaoguan \nproduction centres are still in operation. Also, the production capacity of the Yining  centre in \nthe Xinjiang Autonomous Region (north -west China), and the Tongliao  centre  in Inner Mongolia  \n(north -east China) were expanded . Production was suspended at t he Chongyi production centre \nin Jiangxi Province (south -east China) and the  Lantian centre in Shaanxi Province ( north -west \nChina), while the  Qinglong  production centre in Hebei Province (northeast Ch ina) was closed \nand put into decommissioning. Additional information on these production centres follows:  \n• The Fuzhou production centre  in Jiangxi Province  is an underground mine, which \nexploits Xiangshan volcanic -related type  uranium resources through conv entional ion -\nexchange processing.  \nNATIONAL REPORTS: CHINA (PEOPLE’S REPUBLIC OF)  \nURANIUM 202 2: RESOURCES, PRODUCTION AND DEMAND, NEA No. 7634, ©  OECD 20 23 231 • The Shaoguan production centre in Guangdong Province is an underground mine, which \nexploits Xiazhuang and Zhuguang granite -related type uranium resources using an ion -\nexchange process. The Xiazhuang deposit was closed due to depletion of resources and high production costs; the other deposits are in operation.  \n• The Yining ISL production centre, located in Yining, Xinjiang Autonomous Region, \nmainly exploits sandstone -type uranium resources in the Yili and Turpan -Hami Basins \nusing an ion -exchange hydrometallurgical process. Construction of the new Mongqiguer \nISL project in this centre has significantly increased production capacity.  \n• The Tongliao production centre in Inner Mongolia is an ISL mine, which exploits \nsandstone -type u ranium resources in the southern Songliao Basin using an ion -\nexchange process. The ISL facilities of this centre are being expanded, and production \ncapacity will be increased.  \n• The Chongyi production centre in Jiangxi Province, an underground mine, mainly \nexploits the Lujing and Taoshan granite -related type uranium resources with a \nhydrometallurgical process using heap leaching and ion -exchange. Production was idled \nat this centre due to depletion of resources and high production costs.  \n• The Lantian productio n centre in Shannxi Province is an underground mine that mainly \nexploits Lantian granite -related type uranium resources with an in -place leaching \nprocess. Production was idled due to depletion of resources and high production costs.  \n• The Qinglong production  centre in Hebei Province is an underground mine that mainly \nexploited Qinglong volcanic -related type uranium resources with heap leaching and \nsolvent extraction. This centre was closed and put into decommissioning due to \ndepletion of resources  and high pr oduction costs . \nAnnual u ranium production in China during the last five years is assumed to have been \nmaintained at a level of 1  600 tU and is assumed to have remained steady at 1  600 tU in 2021. \nThe share of ISL production exceeds 70% of the total, with t he potential to increase in future to \neventually replace production from underground mines with higher production costs.   \nRegarding overseas uranium development, the CNNC and CGN have been involved in \nseveral uranium mining projects in Namibia, Kazakhstan and Niger. The CNNC in 2014 bought \na 25% equity stake from Paladin Energy in its flagship Langer Heinrich uranium mine that has been on care and maintenance since September 2018. Production was also idled at the CNNC \nAzelik uranium project in Niger at the end of 2014 and it remains on care and maintenance. On \n26 November 2018, the CNNC signed a share -sale agreement with Rio Tinto and bought a 68.62% \nequity stake of the Rössing uranium mine in Namibia. Rössing produced 2 072 tU in 2019, \n2 109 tU in 2020 and 2 444 tU in 2021. The Husab project in Namibia, which is 90% owned by the \nCGN, produced 3 692 tU in 2019, 3 300 in 2020 and 3 309 in 2021. In Kazakhstan, the Semizbay \nand Irkol mines held by CGN -Kazatomprom produced 960 tU in 2019, declining to 753 tU in 2020 \nand recovering to 962 tU in 2021. In July 2021, the CGN aquired a 49% stake in the JV Ortalyk which owns and operates the Central Mynkuduk mine, which produced 1 579 tU in 2021, and the Zhalpak mine, which is under construction.   \nOwnership structure of the uranium industry  \nThe uranium industry is owned by state -run enterprises in China. Six production centres (Fuzhou, \nShaoguan, Chongyi, Yining, Lantian, and Qinglong) are sole proprietorship enterprises owned by the CNNC. The Tongliao production centre i s a joint venture owned by the CNNC and the CNPC.  \nThe oversea s uranium exploration and development activities are undertaken by the CNNC \nand CGN. The CNNC owns the largest  share of the Rössing  uranium mine in Namibia and holds \nan equity stake  in the Langer Heinrich uranium mine in Namibia . The CGN owns the largest  \nshare of the Husab uranium mine in Namibia. In Kazakhstan, CGN also holds a 49% equity stake \nin the JV Semizbay and a 49% stake in the JV Ortalyk.  \nNATIONAL REPORTS: CHINA (PEOPLE’S REPUBLIC OF)  \n232 URA NIUM 202 2: RESOURCES, PRODUCTION AND DEMAND, NEA No. 7634, © OECD 202 3 Employment in the uranium industry  \nIn 2017 and 2 018, t he industrial restructuring of domestic uranium production continued in China. \nProduction at m ost of t he underground uranium production centres of Southern China with \nrelatively high costs was idled or closed, resulting in a significant reduction in the number of \nemployees . ISL uranium production centres that have been expanded in northern China are highly \nautomated, with no requirement for increased employment . Consequently, employment in \nChina’s uranium production sector has decreased considerably . However, without publicly \navailable information on the number of employees for 2019 and 2020, employment in the Chinese uranium industry has been assumed to have remained at the 2018 level.   \nFuture production centres  \nIndustrial ISL tests are being carried out in some parts of the Erdos and Erlian sandstone -type \nuranium deposits in Inner Mongolia. Encouraging results have been achieved from the ISL tests, \nwhich may render those deposits the principal uranium production centres in China. O nce the \nuranium mark et rebounds, the suspended uranium production centres are expected to be put into \noperation  again.  \nUranium requirements  \nAs of 1  January 2021, the total installed capacity of the 50  nuclear power plants in operation in \nmainland China was 47.5 GWe. Annual ur anium requirements amount to about 9 500 tU. Nuclear \npower generated a total of 344.7 TWh of electricity in 2020, accounting for 4.9% of total generated \nelectricity . Furthermore, an additional 17 nuclear pow er plants with capacity of 17.4  GWe were \nunder co nstruction  in China as of July 2022.  \nDuring the 13th Five-Year Plan period, the Chinese government promoted nuclear power \nconstruction, especially in coastal areas. It also promoted the principle of developing in a clean, \nlow-carbon and eco -friendly manner , as well as ensuring safety. It was projected that the total \ninstalled capacity of nuclear power plants would reach between 50 GWe and 52 GWe by the end \nof 2020. Based on preliminary projections for the reference scenario , uranium requirements will \nrise t o 22 600 tU in 2030, and to 43 400 tU in 2040.  \nSupply and procurement strategy  \nTo meet the demand of nuclear power plants planned within the development programme \napproved by the government, the policy “Facing Two Markets and Using Two Kinds of Resources” \nwas adopted. Uranium supply will be guaranteed through a combination of domestic production, \ndevelopment of non -domestic resources and international trade. As a supplement and balance to \ndomestic production and supply, international trade will ensure a sta ble supply with reasonable \nprices  on both the spot and future markets . \nUranium policies, uranium stocks and uranium prices  \nNational policies relating to uranium  \nThe Chinese government has increased its attention to uranium supply, with an emphasis on safe,  \neconomic and diverse supply sources to ensure reliability. Adequate commercial stocks are also \nrequired. The government has taken several measures to support the exploration and \ndevelopment of uranium resources, such as stable investment for domestic exploration; allowing \nnon- government organisations to engage in uranium exploration activities; reviewing the \nrestrictions associated with regulation of domestic production; as well as promoting investment \nin overseas uranium resources and the establishment of  overseas production centres.  \nNATIONAL REPORTS: CHINA (PEOPLE’S REPUBLIC OF)  \nURANIUM 202 2: RESOURCES, PRODUCTION AND DEMAND, NEA No. 7634, ©  OECD 20 23 233 Uranium prices  \nThe uranium price has been gradually aligned with the international market price in order to \nfollow the global trend of uranium prices.

A systematic exploration \nprogramme including geological, geophysical, and geochemical surveys and related research was \ncarried out to assess the uranium potential of the country. Areas with identified pote ntial were \nexplored in detail using drilling and underground exploration methods.  \nExploration continued systematically until 1989, with annual exploration expenditures in \nthe range of CZK  210-430 million (USD  10-20 million) and an annual drilling effort in  the range \nof 70 -120 km. Exploration was traditionally centred around vein deposits located in \nmetamorphic complexes (Jáchymov, Horní Slavkov, Príbram, Zadní Chodov, Rozná, Olsí and \nother deposits), granitoids of the Bohemian massif (Vítkov deposit) and ar ound the sandstone -\nhosted deposits in northern and north -western Bohemia (Hamr, Stráz, Brevniste, Osecná -Kotel, \nHvezdov, Vnitrosudetská Pánev, Hájek and other deposits).  \nIn 1989, the decision was made to reduce all uranium -related activities. Expenditures \ndecreased to about CZK  150 million (USD  7 million) in 1990 and have not reached that level since. \nNo field exploration has been carried out since the beginning of 1994.  \nRecent and ongoing uranium exploration and mine development activities  \nRecent uranium e xploration activities have been focused on the conservation and processing of \npreviously collected exploration data from Czech uranium deposits. Advance processing of the \nexploration data and building the exploration database will continue in the coming ye ars. \nIn the years 2019 -2020, the geological survey data were processed (analysis and evaluation of \nrock samples, geological documentation, developing a feasibility study and final reports, and archiving). Exploration expenditures were CZK  4.4 million in 20 19, CZK  6.8 million in 2020, and \nwere expected to be CZK  6.2 million in 2021. That is approximately equivalent to USD  197 000, \nUSD 284 000, and USD  289 000, respectively.  \nUranium resources  \nHistorically, most of the known uranium resources of the Czech Repu blic occurred in 23  deposits, \nof which 20 have been mined out or closed. Of the three remaining deposits, only Rozná and Stráz \nwere mined. Resources at the Stráz deposit are, however, limited due to the remediation process \nand resources at the Rozná deposi t have already reached the limits of economic profitability. \nOther deposits (the Osecná -Kotel part of the Stráz bloc and Brzkov) have resources that are not \nmineable because of environmental concerns.  \nIdentified conventional resources (reasonably assured and inferred resources)  \nAs of 1 January 2021, total identified recoverable conventional resources (reasonably assured \nresources and inferred resources) amounted to 119  107 tU. There was a decrease of 62  tU from \nprevious estimates as of 1  January 2019, due t o the mining and re -evaluation of uranium \nresources at the relevant deposits.  \nNATIONAL REPORTS: CZECH REPUBLIC  \nURANIUM 202 2: RESOURCES, PRODUCTION AND DEMAND, NEA No. 7634, ©  OECD 20 23 237 In detail, the reasonably assured resources recoverable at a cost of <USD  130/kgU amounted \nto 804 tU. These are recoverable resources in existing production centres at the Stráz deposits. \nReasonably assured resources recoverable at a cost of <USD  260/kgU amounted to 50 848 tU, a \ndecrease of 62 tU compared to the estimates as of 1  January 2019. The remaining resources of the \nRozná deposit, in the amount of 187  tU, are also included  in this cost category.  \nInferred resources recoverable at a cost of <USD 260/kgU amounted to 68  259 tU and are \nunchanged compared to estimates as of 1  January 2019. These high -cost resources are located \nin the Rozná deposit and especially in the Stráz blo c (the Stráz, Hamr, Osecná -Kotel, and \nBrevniste deposits), but remain unmined due to environmental concerns.  \nUndiscovered conventional resources (prognosticated and speculative resources)  \nAs of 1 January 2021, total undiscovered conventional resources (prognosticated resources and \nspeculative resources) amounted to 239 915 tU. Prognosticated resources at a cost <USD 260/kgU \namounted to 222  915 tU and are unchanged from previous estimates as of 1 January 2019. These \nresources occur mainly (98%) in the sandst one deposits of the Northern Bohemian Cretaceous \nBasin (Stráz block, Tlustec block and Hermanky deposits) and to a lesser extent (2%) in the metamorphic complex of Western Moravia (Rozná and Brzkov deposits).  \nSpeculative resources at a cost around or great er than USD  260/kgU are estimated to amount \nto 17  000 tU and are reported in the unassigned cost category. Since these resources occur in \nNorthern Bohemian Cretaceous sandstone deposits in a groundwater source protection zone, further exploration and evalu ation are not permitted.  \nUranium production  \nHistorical review  \nThe history of uranium mining in the Czech Republic dates to the early 19th century. Uranium \nores have been mined for the glass, ceramic and ink industry in Jáchymov since  1858.  \nIndustrial devel opment of uranium production in former Czechoslovakia began in 1946. \nBetween 1946 and the dissolution of the former Soviet Union in 1991, all uranium produced in former Czechoslovakia was exported to the former Soviet Union.  \nThe first production came from the Jáchymov and Horní Slavkov mines, which completed \noperations in the mid -1960s. Príbram, the main vein deposit, operated from 1950 to 1991. The \nHamr and Stráz production centres, supplied by sandstone deposits, started operation in 1967. \nPeak annual nat ional production of about 3  000 tU was reached around 1960 and production \nremained between 2 500 and 3 000 tU/yr from 1960 until 1989/1990 and declined thereafter. \nA cumulative total of 112  229 tU was produced in the Czech  Republic during the period 1946- 2020, \nof which about 84% was produced by underground and open -pit mining methods and the \nremainder was recovered by in situ  leaching.  \nStatus of production facilities, production capability, recent and ongoing activities and \nother issues  \nFormally, two produc tion centres remain in the Czech Republic. One is an ore processing plant \n(Rozná) in the Dolní Rozínka uranium production centre (Western Moravia) and the second is a \nchemical mining centre in Stráz pod Ralskem (Northern Bohemia). Both the Dolní Rozínka an d \nStráz pod Ralskem production centres are wholly operated by the state -owned enterprise DIAMO.  \nThe Dolní Rozínka centre (Rozná processing plant) produced 0  tU in 2018, 1 tU in 2019 and \n1 tU in 2020 from water treatment only. Because the mining of uranium resources located in the \nRozná mine became unprofitable, it was decided to terminate the operation and start \ndecommissioning the mine as of 1  January 2017. The underground of the mine is gradually being \nflooded. The production centre (Rozná mill) is mainta ined in operation for the uranium \nNATIONAL REPORTS : CZECH REPUBLIC  \n238 URA NIUM 202 2: RESOURCES, PRODUCTION AND DEMAND, NEA No. 7634, © OECD 202 3 extraction from mine water treatment and for the reprocessing of waste dumps. Expected \nuranium production at Dolní Rozínka production centre in 2021 is 4  tU.  \nAt the Stráz pod Ralskem chemical mining centre (Stráz sandston e deposit, with resources \nof 804  tU recoverable at cost <USD 130/kgU), the former acid in situ leaching  (~180  m \nunderground) production centre, produced 29  tU in 2018, 36 tU in 2019 and 28 tU in 2020. \nUranium produced at this centre is a product of environ mental remediation activities that began \nin 1996. Production capability during remediation (without acid) has decreased because of lower \nuranium concentration in solutions. Production in 2021 is expected to amount to 27  tU. In the \nlong term, a gradual decl ine in production is expected.  \nUranium is also obtained from mine water treatment (at existing and former facilities), with \na total recovery of 5  tU expected in 2021 (not including U recovery from in situ leaching [ISL] \nmining restoration activities).  \nOwne rship structure of the uranium industry  \nAll uranium activities, including exploration, production and related environmental activities, are \nbeing carried out by the state -owned enterprise DIAMO, a mining and environmental engineering \ncompany based in Stráz  pod Ralskem.  \nUranium production centre technical details  \n(as of 1  January 2021)  \n Centre #1  Centre #2  \nName of production centre  Dolní Rozínka  Stráz pod Ralskem  \nProduction centre classification  Existing  Existing  \nDate of first production  1957  1967  \nSource  of ore:    \nDeposit name(s)  Rozná  Stráz  \nDeposit type(s)  Metamorphite  Sandstone  \nRecoverable resources (tU)  187 804 \nGrade (% U)  0.171  0.030  \nMining operation:    \nType (OP/UG/ISL)  – ISL \nSize (tonnes ore/day)  – - \nAverage mining recovery (%)  – 60 (estimate d) \nProcessing plant:    \nAcid/alkaline  Alkaline  Acid  \nType (IX/SX)  IX IX \nSize (tonnes ore/day)  \nFor ISL (kilolitre/day)  530 \n– – \n10 000  \nAverage process recovery (%)  90 (estimated)  60 (estimated)  \nNominal production capacity (tU/year)  300 100 \nPlans for ex pansion  No No \nOther remarks  Since 2018, only the processing plant  \nhas been in operation; the Rozná mine is \nbeing decommissioned  Since 1996, production occurs  \nthrough the remediation process  \n \nNATIONAL REPORTS: CZECH REPUBLIC  \nURANIUM 202 2: RESOURCES, PRODUCTION AND DEMAND, NEA No. 7634, ©  OECD 20 23 239 Employment in the uranium industry  \nTotal employment in the Cz ech uranium production centres amounted to 1  556 jobs in 2019 and \n1 546 in 2020 (i.e.  employment related to the production including head office, auxiliary divisions, \nmining emergency services).  \nEmployment directly related to uranium production at Dolní Rozínka and Stráz pod Ralskem \ncentres was 806 in 2019 and 793 in 2020; however, some uranium production is associated with \nremediation.  \nFuture production centres  \nNo other production centres are committed or planned in the near future.

These \nactivities began in 1989. Although this program me was formally terminated in 2009, extensive \nenvironmental remediation projects and some associated social issues continue to be addressed with the help of national and EU funding.  \nThis programme has been aimed at gradually decreasing employment to match declining \nuranium production and at developing alternative (mainly environmental) projects to address \nsocial issues.  \nIn general, the environmental activities include project preparation, environmental impact \nassessments, decommissioning, tailing impoundments and waste rock management, site rehabilitation and maintenance, water treatment and long -term monitoring.  \nThe key environmental remediation projects are as follows:  \n• Remediation of the after -effects of the ISL used in Stráz pod Ralskem that impacted a \ntotal of 266  million  m\n3 groundwater and an enclosure of 600 ha surface area.  \n• Rehabilitation of the tailing impoundments in Mydlovary, Príbram, Stráz pod Ralskem \nand Rozná (a total of 18  ponds with a total area of 593.7  ha). \n• Rehabilitation (including reproces sing) of the waste rock dumps in Príbram, Hamr, Rozná, \nWestern Bohemia and other sites (a total of 368  dumps with a capacity 47.92  million  m3). \nNATIONAL REPORTS : CZECH REPUBLIC  \n240 URA NIUM 202 2: RESOURCES, PRODUCTION AND DEMAND, NEA No. 7634, © OECD 202 3 • Mine water treatment from former uranium facilities in Príbram, Stráz, Horní Slavkov, \nOlsí and others, amounting  to a total of approximately 12  million  m3/year, which results \nin the recovery of about 5  tU annually.  \nPost remediation monitoring and long -term stewardship of the mining legacy sites.  \nMost of the environmental expenses (about 85%) are funded by the state budget, with the \nremainder financed by the EU (9 -12%) and DIAMO (3 -6%). Since 1989, CZK  53 053 million (about \nUSD 2 490 million) were spent on the environmental remediation projects, i.e.  excluding social \nprogrammes and social security. The projects, which  are due to continue until approximately 2040, \nare expected to have a total cost of more than CZK  60 000 million (about USD  2 817 million).  \nThe social part of the programme (obligatory spending, compensation, damages, and rent) \nis financed entirely by the state budget.  \nExpenditures related to environmental activities and social issues  \n(CZK millions)  \n Total through  \nend of 2018  2019 2020 Total through \nend of 2020  2021 \n(expected)  \nUranium environmental remediation  49 383  1 911 1 759 53 053 1 871 \nSocial progra mme and social security  10 267 118 100 10 485 88 \nTotal  59 650  2029  1 859 63 538 1 959 \nUranium requirements  \nThere are two nuclear power plants with a total of six units in operation in the Czech Republic: the older Dukovany Nuclear Power Plant with four VVER -440 reactors, which have been uprated \nto 510  MWe (gross) in the 2009- 2019 period, and the younger Temelin Nuclear Power Plant with \ntwo VVER -1000 reactors, which have been uprated to 1 080 MWe (gross). The sole owner and \noperator of these nuclear power  plants is the Czech power company CEZ, a.s.  \nThere is a general consensus that it will be necessary to build new units in the Czech \nRepublic, and a goal has been set to commission the first new unit by 2040 with others to follow. CEZ is focused on long -term operation projects of both current nuclear power plants, and \npreparation work for new builds at both sites. Negotiations between the Czech government and \nCEZ concerning the construction of new units are ongoing; however, it has already been agreed \nthat the first unit with an output of up to 1 200 MWe (gross) shall be built at the Dukovany site by a subsidiary called Elektrarna Dukovany II.  \nTotal uranium requirements of both nuclear power plants have been averaging 675 tU/year \non a long -term basis, though future annual requirements will vary depending on outage \nplanning due to the ongoing projects to implement longer fuel cycles (16- month at Dukovany \nand 18 -month at Temelin).  \nSupply and procurement strategy  \nCEZ has obtained uranium on the basis of medium-  and long -term contracts, as well as taking \nadvantage of the current low spot market prices. Some uranium was purchased in world \nmarkets, and some was purchased in the form of fabricated fuel, delivered from the Russian \nfabricator TVEL as a package.  \nNATIONAL REPORTS: CZECH REPUBLIC  \nURANIUM 202 2: RESOURCES, PRODUCTION AND DEMAND, NEA No. 7634, ©  OECD 20 23 241 Uranium policies, uranium stocks and uranium prices  \nNational policies relating to uranium  \nThe programme to wind down the Czech uranium industry from the end of the 1980s has already \nbeen formally terminated. An extensive programme for the environmental remediation  of former \nuranium production facilities continues.  \nThe “State Energy Policy of the Czech Republic” (approved by Government Decree No.  362/2015 \nColl.) assumes a balanced energy mix and a share of up to 50% of nuclear energy in total domestic \nelectricity pr oduction after 2040.  \nTo provide the necessary raw material resources, the government adopted the “Raw \nMaterials Policy in the Field of Mineral Materials and their Resources” (updated by Government Decree No. 441/2017 Coll.), which ranks uranium among the critical super strategic raw \nmaterials in line with the European “Raw Materials Initiative”. This document considers the \npriority use of domestic uranium resources if it is economically and environmentally feasible.  \nAccording to the government’s “Concept of the Raw Materials and Energy Security of the \nCzech Republic”, a  feasibility study of early development at Brzkov uranium deposits was \ncompleted in 2014, as well as new technological possibilities for uranium mining that strictly \nrespect environmental con cerns.  \nThe government of the Czech Republic approved mining activities by DIAMO at the Brzkov \ndeposit (Vysocina region); however, there has been significant opposition by local municipalities and strong public resistance to the resumption of uranium mining  in the area.  \nUranium stocks  \nThe Czech power company CEZ  maintains uranium stocks at the level of about two and a half \nyears of forward reactor consumption in all forms of processed uranium. A substantial portion \nof these stocks is in the form of fabricate d fuel stored at the nuclear power plant sites.  \nUranium prices  \nUranium prices are not available as they are commercially confidential. In general, uranium prices in supply contracts incorporate price indicators from the world market according to agreed for mulas.  \nUranium exploration and development expenditures and drilling effort  – domestic  \n(CZK millions)  \n 2018 2019 2020 2021 (expected)  \nPrivate* exploration expenditures  0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 \nGovernment exploration expenditures  0.2 4.4 6.8 6.2 \nPrivate* developm ent expenditures  0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 \nGovernment development expenditures  0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 \nTotal expenditures  0.2 4.4 6.8 6.2 \n* Non -government.  \n  \nNATIONAL REPORTS : CZECH REPUBLIC  \n242 URA NIUM 202 2: RESOURCES, PRODUCTION AND DEMAND, NEA No. 7634, © OECD 202 3 Reasonably assured conventional resources by production method  \n(recoverable tonnes  U) \nProduction method  <USD 40/k gU <USD 80/kgU  <USD 130/kgU  <USD 260/kgU  Recovery factor (%)  \nUnderground mining (UG)  0 0 0 1 665 90  \nIn situ leaching acid  0 0 804 49 183 60 \nTotal  0 0 804 50 848  \n \nReasonably assured conventional resources by processing method  \n(recoverable tonnes  U) \nProcessing method  <USD 40/kgU  <USD 80/kgU  <USD 130/kgU  <USD 260/kgU  Recovery factor (%)  \nConventional from UG  0 0 0 1 665 90 \nIn situ leaching acid  0 0 804 49 183 60 \nTotal  0 0 804 50 848  \nReasonably assured convent ional resources by deposit type  \n(recovera ble tonnes  U) \nDeposit type  <USD 40/kgU  <USD 80/kgU  <USD 130/kgU  <USD 260/kgU  \nSandstone  0 0 804 49 183  \nMetamorphite  0 0 0 1 665 \nTotal  0 0 804 50 848 \nInferred conventional resources by production method  \n(recoverable tonnes  U) \nProduction method  <USD 40/kgU  <USD 80/kgU  <USD 130/kgU  <USD 260/kgU  Recovery factor (%)  \nUnderground mining (UG)  0 0 0 459 90 \nIn situ leaching acid  0 0 0 67 800  60 \nTotal  0 0 0 68 259  \nInferred conventional resources by processing method  \n(recoverable tonnes  U) \nProcessing method  <US D 40/kgU  <USD 80/kgU  <USD 130/kgU  <USD 260/kgU  Recovery factor (%)  \nConventional from UG  0 0 0 459 90 \nIn situ leaching acid  0 0 0 67 800  60 \nTotal  0 0 0 68 259  \n \nNATIONAL REPORTS: CZECH REPUBLIC  \nURANIUM 202 2: RESOURCES, PRODUCTION AND DEMAND, NEA No. 7634, ©  OECD 20 23 243 Inferred conventional resources by deposit type  \n(recoverable tonnes  U) \nDeposit type  <USD 40/kgU  <USD 80/kgU  <USD 130/kgU  <USD 260/kgU  \nSandstone  0 0 0 67 800  \nMetamorphite  0 0 0 459 \nTotal  0 0 0 68 259 \nPrognosticated conventional resources  \n(in situ tonnes  U) \nCost ranges  \n<USD  80/kgU <USD  130/kgU <USD  260/kgU \n0 0 222 915  \nSpeculative conventiona l resources  \n(in situ tonnes U)  \nCost ranges  \n<USD  130/kgU <USD  260/kgU Unassigned  \n0 0 17 000  \n \nHistorical uranium production by production method  \n(tonnes U in concentrates)  \nProduction method  Total through \nend of 2018  2019 2020 Total through \nend of 2020  2021 \n(expected)  \nUnderground mining*  94 455 6 6 94 467 9 \nIn situ leaching  17 698 36 28 17 762 27 \nTotal  112 153 42 34 112 229 36 \n* Pre-2018 totals may include uranium recovered by heap and in -place leaching.  \nHistorical uranium production by processing metho d \n(tonnes U in concentrates)  \nProcessing method  Total through \nend of 2018 2019 2020 Total through \nend of 2020  2021 \n(expected)  \nConventional  91 710 0 0 91 710 0 \nIn-place leaching* 3 0 0 3 0 \nHeap leaching** 125 0 0 125 0 \nIn situ leaching  17 698 36 28 17 762 27 \nOther methods***  2 617 6 6 2 629 9 \nTotal  112 153 42 34 112 229 36 \n* Also known as stope leaching or block leaching.  \n** A subset of open -pit and underground mining, since it is used in conjunction with them.  \n*** Includes mine water treatment and env ironmental restoration.  \nNATIONAL REPORTS : CZECH REPUBLIC  \n244 URA NIUM 202 2: RESOURCES, PRODUCTION AND DEMAND, NEA No. 7634, © OECD 202 3 Historical uranium production by deposit type  \n(tonnes U in concentrates)  \nDeposit type  Total through \nend of 2018  2019 2020 Total through \nend of 2020  2021 \n(expected)  \nSandstone  27 934  36 28 27 998  27 \nGranite -related* 60 893  5 5 60 90 3 5 \nMetamorphite  23 305  1 1 23 307  4 \nMetasomatite  0 0 0 0 0 \nLignite and coal  1 0 0 1 0 \nOther/unspecified  20 0 0 20 0 \nTotal  112 153 42 34 112 229 36 \n* Includes uranium recovered from mine water treatment;

The earliest exploration for uranium was carried out using Geiger counters over selected areas of southern Greenland fr om 1955 to 1956, leading to the discovery of \nradiation anomalies associated with the Kvanefjeld deposit, a large low -grade U -Th-REE deposit \nassociated with the Mesoproterozoic Ilímaussaq layered alkaline intrusive rock complex. In 1973, \nDenmark, including Greenland, joined the European Economic Community when uranium \nexploration was encouraged in member states to secure the community’s uranium resources.  \nSince the Kvanefjeld deposit in southern Greenland was discovered in the mid -1950s, \nexploration of the a rea continued through 1984 with various geophysical and geochemical \nsurveys, drilling, detailed geological mapping, and test mining and assaying work. Resources at \nthe time were estimated at 27 000 tU, with 16  000 tU in the “additional resources” category.  \nAdditional activities in southern Greenland included a regional exploration programme from \n1979 to 1986 involving airborne gamma spectrometry, drainage geochemistry and geological \nstudies. Three prospects were found: 1) uraninite in mineralised fractures and veins; 2) \nuranium -rich pyrochlore mineralisation in alkaline rocks and; 3) uraninite in hydrothermally \nmineralised metasediments. These prospects at the time were believed to represent 60 000 tU \nin the “speculative resources” category.  \nBetween 1972 and  1977, a reconnaissance uranium exploration programme was conducted \nin eastern Greenland involving airborne gamma spectrometry, drainage geochemistry, ground scintillometry and geological studies, but no major discoveries were made. Additional \nreconnaissan ce in western Greenland with airborne gamma spectrometry and follow -up \ngroundwork was performed, also without a major discovery.  \nFollowing a decision in 1985 by the Danish government to exclude nuclear power from its \nenergy sources, a policy was introduced  in 1988 to ban the mining of uranium and other \nradioactive elements in Greenland. Exploration activities continued, however, and in 1995 a \nstream sediment survey was undertaken that included analysis for uranium and thorium, as \nwell as scintillometer read ings covering 7 000 km\n2 in northwest Greenland, but no prospects \nwere found. In 2009, the “Self -Government Act” passed by the Danish Parliament granted \nGreenland control over its natural resources, and in 2013, the Greenland government lifted the \nban on mi ning of uranium and other radioactive elements, generating renewed interest in \nevaluating the potential of Greenland’s uranium resources.  \nIn November 2016, an assessment of the uranium potential in Greenland was conducted \njointly by the Geological Survey of Denmark and Greenland and the Ministry of Mineral Resources, Government of Greenland. Three uranium deposit types were considered: intrusive, sandstone -\nhosted and unconformity- related. The assessment concluded that intrusive and unconformity -\nrelated dep osits have the highest potential for economic concentrations of uranium, and that \nsouthern Greenland has the highest potential for hosting undiscovered deposits.  \nRecent and ongoing uranium exploration and mine development activities  \nSince 2007, Greenland M inerals Ltd (GML), a publicly listed company, had conducted exploration \nactivities for REE -U-Zn mineralisation in the Kvanefjeld area, in southern Greenland, including \ndrilling of 57  710 m of core. The business concept encompassed uranium and zinc by -produ cts \nNATIONAL REPORTS: DENMARK/GREENLAND  \nURANIUM 202 2: RESOURCES, PRODUCTION AND DEMAND, NEA No. 7634, ©  OECD 20 23 247 in addition to the main products of REE. A mining/exploitation licence application was \nsubmitted in July 2019, including updated environmental and social impact assessments (EIA \nand SIA) together with a navigational safety investigation study (NSS). It  was expected that \nuranium would be recovered from leach solutions using industry standard solvent extraction to \nproduce approximately 500 tonnes of U 3O8 (425 tU) per year. The consultation period had started \nin December 2020, and responses received to the EIA and SIA during the consultation period \nwere to be summarised in the form of a white paper by the company. Final EIA and SIA reports were to be prepared with amendments according to the consultation comments and responses. \nAfterwards, the Government of  Greenland was to decide on whether to accept the final EIA and \nSIA reports and white papers, and whether or not to grant an exploitation licence. An April 2021 \nelection in Greenland, however, led to a change in government that passed a new law \nprohibiting  exploration and exploitation of ura nium as of December 2021. Passage of this new \nlaw led GML to request arbitration proceedings with the governments of Greenland and \nDenmark concerning the impact of new legislation on its exploration licence for the Kvane fjeld \nREE, zinc and uranium project under development in southern Greenland.  \nAs of 1 January 2021, uranium exploration and development expenditures and drilling \nstatistics were not available for 2020 and 2021.  \nUranium resources  \nIdentified conventional reso urces (reasonably assured and inferred resources)  \nThe Ilímaussaq igneous complex of southern Greenland hosts the REE -U-Zn-F deposit referred \nto as Kvanefjeld. It is a high -tonnage, low -grade uranium -enriched layered intrusive deposit, \nwith concentrations of around 300 ppm U. Uranium is planned to be mined as a by -product from \na proposed open -pit mine. GML estimates that uranium will account for 5% of the revenue. \nKvanefjeld is the only uranium deposit or occurrence in Greenland with reasonably assured \nurani um resources. The supply cost for uranium will be very low, as the majority of the costs \nwill be borne by the production of the REE, the primary resource (Kvanefjeld is considered to be \none of the largest REE deposits in the world). GML has reported a uran ium specific supply cost \nof approximately USD  13/kgU (USD  5/lb U3O8), which is incremental to the cost of the REE \nproduction. The total identified in situ reasonably assured conventional mineral resource inventory for Kvanefjeld is 102  820 tU. Additional in situ inferred mineral resources of 338  Mt \nore exist in the Zone Sørensen and Zone  3, related to Kvanefjeld, equivalent to 125  143 tU. \nRecoverable uranium resources are calculated using the established and pilot plant tested \nflowsheet of approximately 50% .  \nUndiscovered conventional resources (prognosticated and speculative resources)  \nSeveral uranium occurrences are known in Greenland: seven in southern Greenland, three in \nwestern Greenland and three in eastern Greenland. These include: (1) large, low -grad e magmatic \ndeposits; (2) small syn - to epigenetic pyrochlore mineralisation related to alkaline syenite and \ncarbonatite; and (3) small, high -grade epigenetic uraninite mineralisation hosted in fracture zones. \nMost of these are showings and prospects, with Kvanefjeld the only one with a JORC -compliant \nreserve estimate.

However, 4  500 tonnes of ore were transported to \nthe Risø National Laboratory, Denmark, for test work during the 1980s. Another 30 tonnes of ore \nwere sent in 2014 to Outokumpu, Finland, where a pilot plant operation was conducted th rough \nthe FP7 EURARE project.  \nUranium policies, uranium stocks and uranium prices  \nNational policies relating to uranium  \nGreenland is part of the Danish Realm. Greenland enjoys autonomous authority in domestic affairs while Denmark remains constitutionall y responsible for foreign affairs, defence and \nsecurity. In 2009, the Act on Greenland Self -Government granted Greenland authority over its \nnatural resources (Mineral Resources Act 2009). The Ministry of Mineral Resources and Labour \n(MMRL) is responsible f or strategy and policymaking, legal issues, licence assessment, approvals \nand inspections, and marketing of mineral resources in Greenland. The Ministry of Industry, \nEnergy and Research (MIER) is responsible for trade and export of mineral resources.  \nOn 2 4 October 2013, Greenland’s P arliament, Inatsisartut, lifted a decades -long moratorium \non mining radioactive elements, which opened the way for potential exploration of uranium and thorium.  \nDenmark and Greenland signed in January 2016 an agreement concerning the special foreign, \ndefence and security policy issues related to the possible future mining and export of uranium in \nGreenland. While Denmark is responsible for non -proliferation matters in Greenland, especially \nsafeguards, security and dual -use expo rts, the agreement established a framework for a shared \napproach to ensure compliance with Denmark’s international non -proliferation obligations. The \nagreement underlines the joint Danish and Greenlandic commitment to observe the highest \ninternational standards compared with other uranium supplier states.  \nThe agreement also served as a basis for the new Danish legislation for Greenland on \nsafeguards and export controls, including making exports of nuclear material from Greenland subject to nuclear co- opera tion agreements to provide assurances that they are properly protected \nand used for peaceful purposes. The Act no. 616 on export controls for Greenland and Act no. 621 on safeguards for Greenland were passed on 8 June 2016. The Executive Order on safeguard  \nobligations for the peaceful use of nuclear material in Greenland was published on 10  July 2019.  \nAs part of the agreement concerning the special foreign, defence and security policy issues \nrelated to the possible future mining and export of uranium in Gr eenland, the territorial \nrestrictions regarding six nuclear conventions for Greenland are also in the process of being lifted. In 2019, the territorial restrictions for five of these nuclear conventions were lifted. The conventions are:  \n• The International C onvention for the Suppression of Acts of Nuclear Terrorism;  \n• The Convention on Assistance in Case of a Nuclear Accident or Radiological Emergency;  \n• The Convention on Nuclear Safety, Joint Convention on the Safety of Spent Fuel Management and on the Safety of  Radioactive Waste Management;  \n• The 2005 Amendment to the Convention on the Physical Protection of Nuclear Material;  \n• The International Labour Organisation Radiation Protection Convention (No. 115).  \n  \nNATIONAL REPORTS: DENMARK/GREENLAND  \nURANIUM 202 2: RESOURCES, PRODUCTION AND DEMAND, NEA No. 7634, ©  OECD 20 23 249 Reasonably assured conventional resources by production m ethod  \n(in situ tonnes  U) \nProduction method  <USD 40/kgU  <USD 80/kgU  <USD 130/kgU  <USD 260/kgU  Recovery factor (%)  \nCo-product and by -product  0 0 0 102 820  50 \nTotal  0 0 0 102 820   \nReasonably assured conventional resources by processing method  \n(in situ tonn es U) \nProcessing method  <USD 40/kgU  <USD 80/kgU  <USD 130/kgU  <USD 260/kgU  Recovery factor (%)  \nConventional from OP  0 0 0 102 820  50 \nTotal  0 0 0 102 820   \nReasonably assured conventional resources by deposit type  \n(in situ tonnes  U) \nDeposit type  <USD 40/kgU  <USD 80/kgU  <USD 130/kgU  <USD 260/kgU  \nIntrusive  0 0 0 102 820  \nTotal  0 0 0 102 820  \nInferred conventional resources by production method  \n(in situ tonnes  U) \nProduction method  <USD 40/kgU  <USD 80/kgU  <USD 130/kgU  <USD 260/kgU  Recovery factor (%)  \nCo-produ ct and by -product  0 0 0 125 143  50 \nTotal  0 0 0 125 143   \nInferred conventional resources by processing method  \n(in situ tonnes  U) \nProcessing method  <USD 40/kgU  <USD 80/kgU  <USD 130/kgU  <USD 260/kgU  Recovery factor (%)  \nUnspecified  0 0 0 125 143  50 \nTotal  0 0 0 125 143   \nInferred conventional resources by deposit type  \n(in situ tonnes  U) \nDeposit type  <USD 40/kgU  <USD 80/kgU  <USD 130/kgU  <USD 260/kgU  \nIntrusive  0 0 0 125 143  \nTotal  0 0 0 125 143  \n \nNATIONAL REPORTS: ECUADOR  \n250 URA NIUM 202 2: RESOURCES, PRODUCTION AND DEMAND, NEA No. 7634, © OECD 202 3 Ecuador  \nUranium exploration and mine development  \nHistorical re view \nUranium exploration in Ecuador began in the mid -1960s with the establishment of the Prospecting \nDepartment of the National Polytechnic School, which oversaw the first investigations for \nuranium and radioactive mineral occurrences in the country. During that period, the Ecuadorian Atomic Energy Commission (CEEA) was attached to the National Polytechnic School.  \nBetween 1966 and 1967, the CEEA in co -operation with the International Atomic Energy \nAgency (IAEA; Dr James Cameron) outlined the first radioactive minerals research plan, leading to \nthe discovery and evaluation of several radiometric anomalies between 1968 and 1970 using \nvehicle -borne gamma surveys. The areas investigated in the south of Ecuador in the late 1970s \nincluded Alamor, Sabanilla, Changu arhuayco, Zapotillo, Paletillas and Puyango. During the \n1975- 1978 period, geochemical surveys were carried out in the provinces of Azuay, Loja and \nZamora Chinchipe, as well as further radiometric surveys around the Quijos river region in Napo \nprovince.  \nBy the end of the 1970s, more than 300 radioactive anomalies had been identified as a result \nof 17  300 km\n2 of airborne radiometric surveys in the areas of Manabí, Guayas and Cuenca, \n17 000 km2 of car -borne gamma surveys in the Cordillera, and geochemical sur veys spanning \n8 200 km2 in the north, centre and south of the country.  \nBetween 1982 and 1984, the CEEA, being responsible for uranium prospecting activities, \ncarried out exploration in co- operation with the IAEA and the United Nations Development \nProgram ( UNDP). The areas studied included the Western and Eastern Cordilleran regions and the \nsouthwest of Ecuador. Radiometric surveys and geochemical studies of active stream sediments \nled to the detection of numerous anomalies. The most promising of these anoma lies wa s found \nin the Puyango area (10  km2), where the CEEA continued fieldwork that included 600  m of \nexploration drilling in 4 holes. In the 1990s, CEEA exploration programmes were suspended.  \nIn 2008, the CEEA was merged with the Ministry of Electricity and Renewable Energy, taking \nthe name of Undersecretariat of Nuclear Control, Investigations and Applications (SCIAN), later \nrenamed as the Undersecretariat of Control and Nuclear Applicatio ns (SCAN). That same year, \nthe “ Program for the Development of Ura nium Resources of Ecuador ” was established. The \nshort - and medium -term exploration plan included proposals for a new structure and \norganisation to take charge of developing work programmes, updating equipment and setting \nup the necessary infrastructure, in struments, and tools (laboratories, petrographic and \nmineralogical studies, technical archive on uranium prospecting in Ecuador, etc.) for uranium \nexploration and geological research programmes. The priority was to summarise all research data from the last  decades and to update the regional and geological contexts of uranium \ndeposits in Ecuador. This programme recommended taking into consideration the following \naspects: 1) regional airborne gamma -ray spectrometry surveys; 2) ground gamma -ray \nspectrometry su rveys in the Eastern and Western Cordilleras; 3) detailed prospecting in seven \nanomaly clusters; 4) uranium exploration at the “El Limo -La Sota” district and the Puyango \ndeposit  (this point was not implemented); and 5)  developing a uranium favourability, \nexploration and resources profile of Ecuador. This was originally to be undertaken between 2010 \nand 2014, but has not yet been implemented.  \n  \nNATIONAL REPORTS: ECUADOR  \nURANIUM 202 2: RESOURCES, PRODUCTION AND DEMAND, NEA No. 7634, ©  OECD 20 23 251 In 2009, as part of the IAEA Technical Cooperation Project, “Regional Upgrading of Uranium \nExploration, Exploitation and Yellowcake Production Techniques Taking Environmental \nProblems into Account (RLA3010)”, an expert mission on “Uranium Exploration in Ecuador” was \nimplemented. Among other activities, the mission included technical evaluation visits to the Puyango dep osit and the anomaly area No. 44 in the province of Azuay. The uranium potential \nof anomaly No. 44 was considered as low after the evaluation visit.  \nIn 2010, a joint company called “Gran Nacional Minera” was created by the governments of \nEcuador and Venezu ela. Between 2012 and 2017, “Gran Nacional Minera” conducted exploration \non the El Reventador (Quijos river region) phosphate mining concession, located in the Sucumbíos \nprovince in the north- east of Ecuador. In 2019 , after an advanced exploration assessme nt, the \ncompany decided to close this project and to revert mining concession responsibilities to the \nEcuadorian state.  \nRecent and ongoing uranium exploration and mine development activities  \nBetween 2019 and 2021, the Geological and Energy Research Institu te (IIGE), assisted by the IAEA \nthrough SCIAN´s liaison, updated and reviewed historical information on uranium exploration \nin Ecuador, with the objective of taking up research carried out years ago by the National \nPolytechnic School and the CEEA.  \nDespite  these surveys and background research, the Mining Regulatory and Control Agency \n(ARCOM) has not reported any private or state concessions in its mining portfolio related to uranium exploration in recent years.  \nIn 2020, the Private Technical University of  Loja (UTPL) carried out a geochemical survey in \nthe Chirimoyo and Guineo micro -basins in the Puyango area, finding anomalies of V, U and Zn \nrelated to black limestones, bituminous limestones and calcareous shales of marine origin. This study confirmed the  radiometric anomalies previously identified by the National Polytechnic \nSchool and the CEEA in the 1970s and 1980s.  \nUranium resources  \nIdentified conventional resources (reasonably assured and inferred resources)  \nIdentified conventional resources have not been declared in the country to date.  \nUndiscovered conventional resources (prognosticated and speculative resources)  \nUndiscovered conventional uranium resources have not been assessed in the country to date.  \nUnconventional resources and other materials  \nIn the Puyango sedimentary deposit (V, Zn, U, Cu, Pb), tabular -shaped uranium mineralisation is \nhosted by the Early Cretaceous Puyango Unit, which consists of black limestone, bituminous \nlimestone and calcareous sandstone, underlain by the Aptiense Quebrada L os Sábalos Unit \ncomposed of silicified sandstones, conglomerates, volcanoclastic sands and very fine sandstones \n(with fossilised tree trunks). Further south in the Alamor -Lancones basin, the Maastrichtian \nCazaderos Formation, consisting of medium grained sandstones, black shales and siltstones, \ncould also host uranium occurrences.  \nThis deposit may be considered as a potential source of uranium, where this metal may be \nrecovered as minor co - or by -product to other metals. However, no assessment of uranium \nresources and processing technologies has been carried out to date.  \nNATIONAL REPORTS: ECUADOR  \n252 URA NIUM 202 2: RESOURCES, PRODUCTION AND DEMAND, NEA No. 7634, © OECD 202 3 Uranium production  \nHistorical review  \nEcuador has never produced uranium concentrates.  \nStatus of production facilities, production capability, recent and ongoing activities and \nother issues  \nThere are currently no prospects for uranium production in the country.  \n \nNATIONAL REPORTS: EGYPT  \nURANIUM 202 2: RESOURCES, PRODUCTION AND DEMAND, NEA No. 7634, ©  OECD 20 23 253 Egypt  \nUranium exploration and mine development  \nHistorical review  \nUranium exploration activity started in Egypt as early as 1956. Geophysical, radiometric, and \ngeologic exploration re sulted in the discovery of many radioactive anomalies distributed across \ndifferent geological environments in the Eastern Desert and Sinai.  \nOver the past several years and in several projects, uranium exploration activity resulted in \nthe identification of the most prospective regions in the country. The uranium exploration \nprogramme was undertaken by the Egyptian Nuclear Materials Authority (NMA), which is the \ngovernment body responsible for nuclear raw materials in the country. The NMA discovered \nuranium m ineralisation in the northern part of the Gabal Gattar granite batholith during the \n1984 -1985 field season. Within the framework of the resource evaluation programme, the first \nmining test shafts were excavated in 1998 and 1999 in the Sinai and Gabal Gatta r prospects, \nrespectively.  \nRecent and ongoing uranium exploration and mine development activities  \nFrom 2016 to 2019, the NMA focused on the exploration of four prospects in the Eastern Desert \nand South Sinai. These activities involved exploratory trenching  and shallow drilling programmes, \nsupported by geophysical and geochemical surveys, to follow -up subsurface extensions of the \nformations hosting uranium mineralisation.  \nGranitic rocks are known to have a much higher uranium content than other common rock \ntypes, and uranium exploration activities led to the discovery of several uranium anomalies and occurrences within or near the periphery of some granitic plutons in the Eastern Desert of Egypt (e.g. the Gabel Gattar, Gabel EI- Erediya, El Missikat and Um Ar a areas). Secondary uranium \nminerals dominate the mineralogical composition of these deposits. Yellow mineral \nimpregnations are found in fractured and albitised alkali- feldspar granites. The mineralisation \noccurs as stains along fracture surfaces and as ac icular crystals filling cavities.\n \nUranium anomalies in south -western  Sinai are restricted to the early Carboniferous Um \nBogma Formation. Uraniferous zones are associated with the lower and middle members of the \nUm Bogma Formation shales and dolomites.  \nUran ium resources  \nIdentified conventional resources (reasonably assured and inferred resources)  \nAbu Zenima project  \nThe early Carboniferous succession of sandstones, claystones and siltstones hosts anomalous \nzones with secondary uranium mineralisation. The occu rrences are found in several locations \naround Abu Zenima, in the eastern Gulf of Suez. The economic potential has not yet been fully \nassessed because of difficult drilling conditions. However, some target areas are under \ndevelopment where secondary uranium  mineralisation was identified at the surface. Detailed \ngeologic work, diamond drilling and test mine work are being conducted. A 2008 assessment \nreported in situ inferred resources of about 100 tU, hosted primarily in sandstones and carbonate rocks. Addit ional investigations from 2016 to 2019 increased in situ inferred resources to 515 tU.  \nNATIONAL REPORTS: EGYPT  \n254 URA NIUM 202 2: RESOURCES, PRODUCTION AND DEMAND, NEA No. 7634, © OECD 202 3 Gabal Gattar project  \nAn elongated granite batholith trending over 40 km, is host to vein -type uranium mineralisation \nassociated with molybdenite, defined in eight uranif erous occurrences. These occurrences are \ncharacterised by intense secondary uranium minerals with characteristic yellow to greenish -\nyellow colours. Nearly all the recorded uranium occurrences are associated with strongly \ndeformed and deeply hematitised zon es.  \nUranium resources of 2  000 tU of in situ inferred resources were last reported in the 2009 \nRed Book for Gabal Gattar. In the last two years, the area has been the subject of some subsurface exploration work (deep trenching and shallow drilling) to fol low-up prospective subsurface \nextensions of mineralisation and to correlate with surface occurrences. Thus far, no additional \nresource estimates have been made.  \nUndiscovered conventional resources (prognosticated and speculative resources)  \nEgypt has conduc ted systematic uranium resource prediction and evaluation with prognosticated \nresources estimated to be around 13 600 tU, as reported in the following tables. Identified uranium \nresources increased due to drilling activity and re -evaluation of uranium reso urces.  \nAbu Rusheid project  \nUranium occurrences are associated with rare earth elements (REE) in the paragneiss and metamorphosed sandstones in the Abu Rusheid project area. However, previous Red Book reports indicate that no speculative uranium resources were identified. Exploration activity in recent \nyears has added an estimated potential of 10  000 tU of in situ prognosticated resources to the Abu \nRusheid area. The NMA intends to continue work by undertaking a drilling programme in the \ncoming years to con firm these results.  \nEl Sella project  \nAdditional potential resources may be identified in the El Sella project area, where uranium exploration permits have been held over the past few years. Ongoing exploration is aimed at extending the existing orebody as  well as identifying and evaluating new ore bodies, given the \npotential for additional resources. The area contains an estimated potential for 3 600  tU of in situ \nprognosticated uranium resources. Follow -up drilling is expected to continue through 2020 -2022. \nWith further exploration in uranium prospective areas, more uranium resources are expected to be discovered.  \nUnconventional resources and other materials  \nThe Egyptian phosphate deposits represent one of the more promising unconventional uranium resour ces. Estimates of these phosphate ores reach about 700 million tonnes with uranium \ncontent ranging between 50 ppm and 200 ppm (as reported in the 2009 Red Book). No reliable \nestimate of the uranium resources in Egyptian phosphate ores has been made since 2 008, when it \nwas reported in the 2009 Red Book that it is possible the deposits contain up to 42  000 tU.  \nBlack sands, a potential source of unconventional uranium resources, are considered the \nsecond most important unconventional source of uranium in Egyp t. Monazite, one of the black \nsand ore minerals, is estimated to contain about 6 million tonnes of radiogenic and rare earth \nelements with potential economic and industrial returns. At some locations, such as in the El \nBorols area, the monazite contains up  to 0.5% U and 6% Th, as well as 60% rare earth elements.  \nUranium production  \nHistorical review   \nBetween 2007 and 2011, the NMA worked on the development of the small semi -pilot plant for the \nextraction of uranium from different rock types, and the evaluat ion of leaching and extraction \nefficiencies.  Tests were carried out on uranium mineralisation from the Gattar (Eastern Desert) \nand Abu Zenima (South Sinai) projects to study the most suitable methods of dissolving uranium \nNATIONAL REPORTS: EGYPT  \nURANIUM 202 2: RESOURCES, PRODUCTION AND DEMAND, NEA No. 7634, ©  OECD 20 23 255 from granitic rocks (Gattar), and sedimentary rocks (Sinai), as well as the ideal factors for using \nthe vat leaching system and extraction using the ion- exchange technique.  \nAfter completing the laboratory experiments, a flowsheet for the extraction of uranium from \nores in the Gattar granite was developed. This was followed by the construction of the Gattar \nexperimental yellowcake production unit with a capacity of 1  000 tonnes of ore materials at an \naverage concentration of 200 ppm U ( 0.02% U), and a production rate of 300 kg of yellowcake \nannually. At the Abu Zenima project, a small heap leach pad was constructed in 2018 next to the experimental vat with a capacity of about 1 000 tonnes of uranium -bearing rock ore per \nbatch, at an average concentration of 250  ppm U, and it is now in operati on. \nFrom 1999 to 2003, the NMA worked on the development of a semi -pilot plant for the \nextraction of uranium from phosphoric acid (purification of phosphoric acid through the extraction of uranium). The design capacity of this plant is 15  m\n3/d of acid production, but \nunexpected technical problems caused a delay in production of yellowcake. The project was \nsuspended due to difficulties relating to the low uranium content of phosphoric acid and \ndifficulties in the extraction cycle. The semi -pilot plant for pu rification of phosphoric acid has \nsince been converted to produce phosphoric acid for agricultural, food and other domestic purposes.  \nStatus of production facilities, production capability, recent and ongoing activities, and \nother issues  \nIn November 2017, the NMA began establishing the first production unit to leach uranium, in \nSouth Sinai, with a capacity of 4 000 tonnes of uranium -bearing ore per batch, using a heap leach \nand limited vat basin leaching process. At the Gattar project, the uranium is leac hed by placing \nthe ores in vats or on a heap leach pad. In December 2019, the trial operation began extracting \nyellowcake by an ion- exchange process as an experimental production stage at the Abu Zenima \nproject.  \nFuture production centres  \nEgypt developed mi ne and processing pilot projects at Gattar and Abbu Zenima in 2001 and is \nplanning to do the same at Abu Rusheid and El Sella in 2025. Depending on the results of these \npilot projects, production centres could be constructed in the future.  \nGattar project  \nThe existing pilot production centre includes vat leaching (1 000 tonnes of uraniferous granitic ore \ncapacity) and small -scale heap leaching (2 500 tonnes ore). The committed production centre will \ninclude the construction of a heap leaching pad, with a cap acity of 10 000 tonnes ore.  \nAbu Zenima project  \nThe existing pilot production centre includes vat leaching (capacity 4 000 tonnes of ore) and a heap leaching pad (1 000 tonnes of uraniferous ore).  \nAbu Rusheid project  \nThe planned pilot production centre will include vat leaching (with a suitable tonnage of \nbasement uraniferous rocks) and an ion- exchange unit for uranium extraction.  \nEl Sella project  \nThe planned pilot production centre will include a heap leaching pad and an ion -exchange unit \nfor uranium extraction.  \n  \nNATIONAL REPORTS: EGYPT  \n256 URA NIUM 202 2: RESOURCES, PRODUCTION AND DEMAND, NEA No. 7634, © OECD 202 3 Ownership structure of the uranium industry  \nThe uranium industry in Egypt is expressed as a system of small experimental units that do not \ncontribute to global production and are owned by the government.  \nEmployment in the uranium industry  \nThe urani um industry supporting Egypt’s experimental units has depended on specialised \nworkers in this field since 1999, in addition to new technical staff and workers gaining work experience.  \nProduction and/or use of mixed oxide fuels  \nEgypt does not produce or us e mixed oxide fuels.  \nEnvironmental activities  \nAll trial mining, trenching and drilling operations, as well as laboratories, are subject to \nenvironmental control and radiation safety regulations following guidelines of the International \nAtomic Energy Agenc y, and to the supervision, follow -up, and control of the Egyptian Nuclear \nand Radiological Regulatory Authority.  \nUranium exploration and development expenditures and drilling effort  – domestic  \n(Egyptian pounds –  EGP)  \n 2018  2019  2020  2021 (expected)  \nIndustry exploration expenditures  0 0 0 0 \nGovernment exploration expenditures  1 000 000  1 000 000  2 000 000  3 000 000  \nIndustry development expenditures  0 0 0 0 \nGovernment development expenditures  500 000  500 000  1 000 000  1 000 000  \nTotal expenditures  1 500  000 1 500  000 3 000  000 4 000  000 \nIndustry exploration drilling (metres)  0 0 0 0 \nIndustry exploration  holes drilled  0 0 0 0 \nIndustry exploration trenches (metres)  0 0 0 0 \nIndustry trenches (number)  0 0 0 0 \nGovernment exploration  drilling (metres)  1 500  2 000  1 550  3 100  \nGovernment exploration  holes drilled  70 90 72 100 \nGovernment exploration trenches (metres)  360 480 330 500 \nGovernment trenches (number)  9 12 14 20 \nIndustry development  drilling (metres)  0 0 0 0 \nIndustry* development  holes drilled  0 0 0 0 \nGovernment development  drilling (metres)  250 500 200 350 \nGovernment development holes drilled 12 22 8 20 \nSubtotal exploration drilling (metres)  0 0 0 0 \nSubtotal exploration holes drilled  0 0 0 0 \nSubtotal development drilling (metres)  0 0 0 0 \nSubtotal development holes drilled  0 0 0 0 \nTotal drilling (metres)  1 750 2 500 1 750 3 450 \nTotal number of holes drilled  82 112 80 120 \nNATIONAL REPORTS: EGYPT  \nURANIUM 202 2: RESOURCES, PRODUCTION AND DEMAND, NEA No. 7634, ©  OECD 20 23 257 Inferred conventional resources by production method  \n(in situ tonnes  U) \nProduction method  <USD 40/kgU  <USD 80/kgU  <USD 130/kgU  <USD 260/kgU  Recovery factor (%)  \nUnderground mining (UG)  0 0 0 2 000   \nOpen -pit mining (OP)  0 0 515 515  \nTotal  0 0 515 2 515   \nInferred conventional resources by deposit type  \n(in situ tonnes  U) \nDeposit type  <USD 40/kgU  <USD 80/kgU  <USD 130/kgU  <USD 260/kgU  \nSandstone  0 0 515 515 \nGranite -related  0 0 0 2 000  \nTotal  0 0 515 2 515  \nPrognosticated conventional resources  \n(in situ tonnes  U) \nCost ranges  \n<USD  80/kgU  <USD  130/kgU  <USD  260/kgU  \n0 13 600  13 600  \nSpeculative conventional resources  \n(in situ  tonnes U)  \nCost ranges  \n<USD  130/kgU  <USD  260/kgU  Unassigned  \nNA NA NA \n \nNATIONAL REPOR TS: FINLAND  \n258 URA NIUM 202 2: RESOURCES, PRODUCTION AND DEMAND, NEA No. 7634, © OECD 202 3 Finland  \nUranium exploration  \nHistorical review  \nUranium exploration in Finland was first carried out between 1955 and 1988, initially by the \ncompanies Atomienergia Oy, Imatran Voima Oy  and Outokumpu Oy, and from 1973 by the \nGeological Survey of Finland (GTK). In the late 1980s, exploration activities were stopped. \nExploration began again in the 2000s by Areva (now Orano) and some junior companies. In 2010, \nAreva closed down its Finnish subsidiary, and its exploration assets in Finland were purchased \nby Mawson Resources Ltd (now Mawson Gold Ltd).

Between 2010 and 2015, Talvivaara Sotkamo \nOy prepared for uranium recovery as a by- product from the Talvivaara deposit in Sotkamo, \neastern Finland. The Talvivaara Ni -Zn-Cu-Co deposit is hosted by metamorphosed black shales in \nthe Kainuu Schist Belt. It is a low -grade, large- tonnage deposit averaging 0.26 wt% Ni, 0.53 wt% Zn, \n0.14 wt% Cu, 0.02 wt% Co, and 0.0017 wt%  U.  \nProduction of nickel, cobalt and zinc from the Talvivaara ore deposit commenced in 2008. The \nproduction process includes open -pit mining, crushing, heap leaching and metals recovery. The \nleach solution percolates to the bottom of the leach pads and is either recirculated through the heap or fed to metals recovery. During metals recovery, nickel, zinc, cobalt and copper are precipitated from the pregnant leach solution (PLS) and filtered to produce saleable metal products. \nAfter the target metals have been recovered, the solution is further purified to remove unwanted \nmetals, which are directed to process waste gypsum ponds.  \nIn 2010, Talvivaara Sotkamo Oy announced plans to recover uraniu m as a by- product using \nsolvent extraction, resulting from the fact that a large part of uranium dissolves in the PLS during \nheap leaching. Dissolved uranium has largely ended up in the process wastes and partly in the \nNi-Co sulphide concentrate product. U ranium has been present as an impurity in the Ni -Co \nsulphide consigned to the Norilsk Nickel refinery at Harjavalta, western Finland. Uranium \nresiduals have been extracted from the nickel products at the Harjavalta Nickel Refinery, and \nreported to the Radi ation and Nuclear Safety Authority (STUK). The Norilsk Nickel Harjavalta \nrefinery has been licensed by the STUK to extract uranium at less than 10  tU/year. As of \n31 December 2020, the total amount of natural uranium stored at Norilsk Nickel Harjavalta was \nabout 3.6  tU.  \nNATIONAL REPOR TS: FINLAND  \n260 URA NIUM 202 2: RESOURCES, PRODUCTION AND DEMAND, NEA No. 7634, © OECD 202 3 During 2011 -2013, the uranium solvent extraction plant was built as a new unit in the metals \nrecovery complex of Talvivaara. In 2012, the Finnish government granted a uranium extraction \nlicence to Talvivaara Sotkamo Oy in accordance with the  nuclear energy legislation. In 2013, \nhowever, the Supreme Administrative Court returned the licence to the Finnish government for \nreassessment due to several changes in the operations of Talvivaara Sotkamo Oy after the licence \ndecision, including the corp orate reorganisation. Eventually, Talvivaara Sotkamo Oy filed for \nbankruptcy due to its financial problems in 2014. State -owned company Terrafame Oy acquired \nthe operations and assets of Talvivaara Sotkamo Oy from its bankruptcy estate in 2015, and as of \n1 January 2021, was carrying on the mining operations in Sotkamo.  \nIn 2017, Terrafame Oy applied to the Finnish government for a licence to recover uranium \nas a by- product at Terrafame’s mine in Sotkamo, in accordance with the nuclear energy \nlegislation. In  February 2020, the Finnish government granted a uranium extraction licence to \nTerrafame. However, the licence was appealed to the Supreme Administrative Court. In June \n2021, the Supreme Administrative Court confirmed the uranium extraction licence that ha d \nbeen previously granted by the government. The mine site in Sotkamo currently includes an \nalmost fully completed uranium solvent extraction plant from the time of Terrafame’s predecessor, Talvivaara Sotkamo Oy. Terrafame expects to start uranium producti on in \nSotkamo in 2024, after the establishment of the economic feasibility of uranium recovery and \ncompletion of an investment decision, final plant design, project implementation, deployment, \nand start -up of the uranium solvent extraction plant.  \nSecondary  sources of uranium  \nProduction and/or use of mixed oxide fuels  \nFinland does not produce or use mixed oxide fuels.  \nProduction and/or use of re -enriched tails  \nRe-enriched tails have not been used in 2019 and 2020.  \nRegulatory regime \nThe Mining Act regulates e xploration and mining activities in Finland. All licences under the \nMining Act are decided by the mining authority Tukes. An environmental permit according to the Environmental Protection Act is required for mining. The mine closure process is regulated \nby mining and environmental legislation, as well as a number of EU and other specifications.  \nThe Radiation and Nuclear Safety Authority (STUK) is the regulatory body for uranium \nproduction, as specified in the Nuclear Energy Act and the Radiation Act. Produc tion of uranium \nor thorium needs a licence from the Finnish government according to the Nuclear Energy Act. \nA licence application must be submitted to the government. Statements from different authorities \n(including STUK) are required for the decision on t he licence, which is prepared by the Ministry of \nEconomic Affairs and Employment and decided by the government.  \nAccording to the Mining Act of 2011, an exploration licence is required for uranium exploration \n(e.g. for drilling and trenching). Permit applic ations concerning a uranium mine under the Mining \nAct and the Nuclear Energy Act are handled jointly and decided on in a single decision by the \ngovernment. A permit for a uranium mine requires that the mining activities be in line with the \noverall good of society, the municipality in question has given its consent and safety requirements \nare fulfilled.  \nSTUK’s regulatory control covers the radiation exposure of workers and the public, \nenvironmental monitoring, waste management, emergency preparedness, nuclea r material \naccountancy and physical protection of nuclear materials. STUK verifies that safety and security requirements are fulfilled. Radioactive tailings are regarded as nuclear waste and are subject to \nfunding for the future costs of waste management. Uranium concentrate export, controlled by \nthe Ministry for Foreign Affairs, is also subject to national and international safeguards control.  \nNATIONAL REPORTS: FINLAND  \nURANIUM 202 2: RESOURCES, PRODUCTION AND DEMAND, NEA No. 7634, ©  OECD 20 23 261 The environmental impact assessment procedure is applied to all uranium mining projects, \nwithout any limitations on the annual amount of the extracted resources. In addition, other \nlegislation to be applied for mining activities includes the Water Act, the Nature Conservation Act, \nthe Wilderness Act, the Chemicals Act, the Land Use and Building Act, the Occupational Safety and Health Act, the Waste Act and various government decrees and decisions.  \nUranium requirements  \nFour nuclear power plant units (two each at the Olkiluoto and Loviisa Nuclear Power Plants) with \na total generating capacity of 2.8  GWe (net) are in ope ration, providing about 34% of domestic \nelectricity generation. These four reactors require about 430 tU annually. Olkiluoto units are \nowned and operated by Teollisuuden Voima Oyj (TVO), and Loviisa units by Fortum Power and \nHeat Oy.  \nConstruction of Finlan d’s fifth nuclear power plant unit, TVO’s Olkiluoto 3 (EPR; 1.6  GWe net), \nwas completed in December 2021, and the unit will be connected to the national grid in early 2022. \nTVO selected European pressurised reactor (EPR) technology for the Olkiluoto 3 unit  in 2003, and \nthe Areva- Siemens Consortium started construction in 2005. It is expected that regular electricity \nproduction at the Olkiluoto 3 unit will begin in June 2022, 13 years later than originally planned.  \nIn 2010, the Finnish P arliament ratified th e decisions in principle (DIP) for the construction \nof two new reactors, one at the existing Olkiluoto site (OL4) by TVO and a single reactor at the \ngreenfield Pyhäjoki site by Fennovoima. According to the DIP, the deadline for submitting the applications for the construction licences of these units was the end of June 2015.  \nIn June 2015, TVO decided not to apply for a construction licence for OL4 during the validity \nof the DIP made in 2010. The reason was the delay of the start -up of the Olkiluoto 3 power plant \nunit. Consequently, the DIP made by the Finnish government and approved by parliament expired at the end of June 2015. TVO will remain prepared to apply for a new decision in principle for OL4. The application is subject to a separate decision.  \nFenno voima is a new nuclear power company, established by a group of Finnish companies \nin 2007. It will build a nuclear power plant unit (Hanhikivi 1) in Pyhäjoki, northern Finland. Fennovoima has two main owners: Voimaosakeyhtiö SF Oy (with a 66% stake) and Ro satom’s \nsubsidiary RAOS Voima Oy (with 34%). Voimaosakeyhtiö SF is owned by Finnish energy and industrial companies.  \nA construction licence application for Fennovoima’s Hanhikivi 1 unit was submitted to the \nFinnish government in 2015. Fennovoima expects that the construction licence for the Hanhikivi 1 unit will be granted by the government in 2022, and that the unit’s construction will begin in \n2023 with a view to start commercial operation around 2029. The nuclear power plant unit of \nFennovoima (AES -2006;  1.2 GWe net) will be supplied by RAOS Project Oy, which is a part of \nRosatom.  \nSupply and procurement strategy  \nTVO procures its nuclear fuel for the Olkiluoto nuclear power plant through a decentralised \nsupply chain, entering into negotiations and making procurement contracts with each separate \nsupplier at the various stages of the fuel production chain. There are several suppliers for each \nstage of the chain. Procurement operations are based on long -term contracts with suppliers. \nThese companies have mini ng operations in many countries. Most of the uranium procured by \nTVO comes from Kazakhstan, Canada, and Australia, and the nuclear fuel assemblies ordered by the company are fabricated in Germany, Spain or Sweden.  \nThe fuel assemblies used at Fortum’s Lovii sa nuclear power plant are completely of Russian \norigin. Nuclear fuel is acquired from the Russian company TVEL as a turnkey delivery, from the acquisition of the uranium to the fabrication of the fuel assemblies. Conversion, enrichment and fuel fabricatio n are carried out by TVEL, which acquires the uranium used in the fuel \nassemblies from ARMZ Uranium Holding Co. In 2020, the uranium used in the Fortum’s fuel assemblies originated from the Krasnokamensk, Khiagda and Dalur mines.  \nNATIONAL REPOR TS: FINLAND  \n262 URA NIUM 202 2: RESOURCES, PRODUCTION AND DEMAND, NEA No. 7634, © OECD 202 3 Fennovoima will acquire th e nuclear fuel as an integrated fuel supply from TVEL. The \nintegrated delivery will cover the procurement of the uranium and the manufacturing of the \nfuel for the first ten years of operation of Hanhikivi 1. The fuel supply agreement between \nFennovoima and  TVEL was approved by the Euratom Supply Agency in 2014.  \nUranium policies, uranium stocks and uranium prices  \nNuclear energy legislation  \nThe legal basis of the use of nuclear energy in Finland consists of the Nuclear Energy Act and \nthe Nuclear Energy Decree. The purpose of nuclear energy legislation is to ensure that the use \nof nuclear energy is in line with the overall good of society, safe for people and the environment, \nand that its use does not enable the proliferation of nuclear weapons. The use of nuclear energy \ncreates several obligations for the licensee: the licensee must, among other things, ensure the \nsafety of operations, manage the nuclear waste created through the operations, and assume \nresponsibility for all nuclear waste management costs. Nuclear waste management costs are \nprepared for by collecting funds in advance in the price of electricity and depositing them in the \nNational Nuclear Waste Management Fund.  \nThe Nuclear Energy Decree and government decisions have been issued based on the Nuclear \nEnergy Act. The government decisions concern nuclear plant safety, safety arrangements, \npreparedness arrangements, and the final disposal of operating waste and spent nuclear fuel. \nBased on the authorisation by the nuclear energy legislation, the STUK p ublishes detailed safety \nrequirements for the use of nuclear energy. Radiation safety is regulated by the Radiation Act and \nthe Radiation Decree. The Nuclear Liability Act stipulates that the licensee must have nuclear \nliability insurance that will compensate for injuries caused to outsiders by a possible nuclear accident, to the extent decreed by law.  \nNuclear waste management  \nSpent nuclear fuel from the Olkiluoto and Loviisa Nuclear Power Plants is stored in the water pools of the fuel storage facilities at Olkiluoto and Loviisa until finally disposed of in the Olkiluoto bedrock in the municipality of Eurajoki. Posiva Oy, a company owned by TVO and Fortum, is responsible for the final disposal of the spent nuclear fuel of the owners. Spent nuclear fuel from \nthe nuclear power plants of TVO and Fortum will be packed in copper canisters and embedded in \nOlkiluoto bedrock at a depth of 400 -450 m. The final disposal of spent nuclear fuel is based on the \nuse of multiple release barriers to ensure that the nuclear waste cannot be released into organic \nnature or become accessible to humans. The release barriers include the ceramic, solid state of \nthe fuel, the disposal canister, the bentonite buffer, the backfilling of the tunnels and the \nsurrounding rock.  \nPosiva is currently constructing the final disposal facility in Olkiluoto. In 2015, Posiva \nreceived a construction licence from the Finnish government for its final disposal system, \nconsisting of a nuclear fuel encapsulation plant and final disposal facility. The ex cavation of the \nfinal disposal facility began in 2016, and the construction of the encapsulation plant started in 2019. The current plan is to start final disposal in the mid -2020s.  \nWith respect to the Hanhikivi 1 project, Fennovoima has two alternative final disposal \nlocations in its environmental impact assessment (EIA) programme: Pyhäjoki or Eurajoki. \nFennovoima aims to engage in long -term final disposal co- operation with Posiva and its owners \n(TVO and Fortum).  \nUranium stocks  \nThe nuclear power utilities  maintain reserves of fuel assemblies from seven months to one \nyear’s use, although the legislation demands only five months’ use.  \nNATIONAL REPORTS: FINLAND  \nURANIUM 202 2: RESOURCES, PRODUCTION AND DEMAND, NEA No. 7634, ©  OECD 20 23 263 Uranium prices  \nDue to commercial confidentiality, price data are not available.  \nReasonably assured conventional resources by production method  \n(in situ tonnes  U) \nProduction method  <USD 40/kgU  <USD 80/kgU  <USD 130/kgU  <USD 260/kgU  \nUnderground mining (UG)  0 0 500 500 \nOpen -pit mining (OP)  0 0 1 000  1 000  \nTotal  0 0 1 500  1 500  \nReasonably assured conventional resources by proces sing method  \n(in situ tonnes  U) \nProcessing method  <USD 40/kgU  <USD 80/kgU  <USD 130/kgU  <USD 260/kgU  \nConventional from UG  0 0 500 500 \nConventional from OP  0 0 1 000  1 000  \nTotal  0 0 1 500  1 500  \nReasonably assured conventional resources by deposit type  \n(in situ tonnes  U) \nDeposit type  <USD 40/kgU  <USD 80/kgU  <USD 130/kgU  <USD 260/kgU  \nMetamorphite  0 0 500 500 \nIntrusive  0 0 1 000  1 000  \nTotal  0 0 1 500  1 500  \nHistorical uranium production by production method  \n(tonnes U in concentrates)  \nProduction method  Total through \nend of 2018  2019 2020 Total through \nend of 2020  2021 (expected)  \nOpen -pit mining 15 0 0 15 0 \nUnderground mining  15 0 0 15 0 \nTotal  30 0 0 30 0 \nHistorical uranium production by processing method  \n(tonnes U in concentrates)  \nProcessing method  Tota l through  \nend of 2018 2019 2020 Total through \nend of 2020  2021 (expected)  \nConventional  30 0 0 30 0 \nTotal  30 0 0 30 0 \n \nNATIONAL REPOR TS: FINLAND  \n264 URA NIUM 202 2: RESOURCES, PRODUCTION AND DEMAND, NEA No. 7634, © OECD 202 3 Historical uranium production by deposit type  \n(tonnes U in concentrates)  \nDeposit type  Total through \nend of 2018  2019 2020 Total throug h \nend of 2020  2021 (expected)  \nSandstone  30 0 0 30 0 \nTotal  30 0 0 30 0 \nMid-term production projection (tonnes U/year)  \n2021 2022*  2025*  2030*  2035*  2040*  \n0 0 N/A  N/A  N/A  N/A  \n* By-product of nickel production from the Talvivaara black schist- hosted Ni -Zn-Cu-Co deposit (unconventional resources).  \nRe-enriched tails production and use  \n(tonnes natural U -equivalent)  \nRe-enriched tails  Total through  \nend of 2018  2019 2020 Total through  \nend of 2020  2021 \n(expected)  \nProduction  0 0 0 0 0 \nUse 843 0 0 843 0 \nNet n uclear electricity generation  \n 2019 2020 \nNuclear electricity generated (TWh net)  22.9  22.4  \nInstalled nuclear generating capacity to 2040  \n(MWe net)  \n2019 2020 2025 2030 2035 2040 \n2 780  2 780  Low  High  Low  High  Low  High  Low  High  \n4 410  4 410  5 110  5 110  4 610 4 610  2 830  4 610  \nAnnual reactor -related uranium requirements* to 2040 (excluding MOX)  \n(tonnes U)  \n2019 2020 2025 2030 2035 2040 \n426 720 Low  High  Low  High  Low  High  Low  High  \n690 750 700 750 700 770 450 770 \n* Refers to natural uranium acquisitions,  not necessarily consumption during the calendar year.  \nNATIONAL REPORTS: FRANCE  \nURANIUM 202 2: RESOURCES, PRODUCTION AND DEMAND, NEA No. 7634, ©  OECD 20 23 265 France \nUranium exploration and mine development  \nHistorical review  \nUranium exploration began in 1946, focusing on previously discovered deposits and a few \noccurrences discovered during radium explorati on. In 1948, exploration led to the discovery of \nthe La  Crouzille deposit, which at one time was of major importance. By 1955, additional \ndeposits had been identified in the granite areas of Limousin, Forez, Vendée and Morvan. \nProspecting activities were s ubsequently extended to sedimentary formations in small intra -\ngranitic basins and terrigeneous formations derived from eroded granite mountains, mainly located north and south of the Massif Central.  \nRecent and ongoing uranium exploration and mine developme nt activities  \nNo domestic activities have been carried out in France since 1999.  \nAs of 2020, Orano S.A. (formerly Areva S.A.) has been working outside France focusing on \nthe discovery of exploitable resources in Canada, Gabon, Kazakhstan, Mongolia, Namibia  and \nNiger. In Canada, Kazakhstan and Niger, Orano is also involved in uranium mining operations. In addition, as a non -operator, it holds shares in several mining operations and research \nprojects in different countries. In 2020, Orano started exploration in Uzbekistan.  \nUranium resources  \nIdentified conventional resources (reasonably assured and inferred resources)  \nOrano no longer reports resources or reserves in France since the historic data on which these \nestimates are based do not conform to modern inter national standards.  \nUndiscovered conventional resources (prognosticated and speculative resources)  \nNo systematic appraisal has been made of undiscovered resources.  \nUranium production  \nStatus of production facilities, production capability, recent and ongoin g activities and other \nissues \nFollowing the closure of all uranium mines in 2001, all ore processing plants were shut down, dismantled and the sites reclaimed.  \nIn France, a total of 244  sites, ranging from exploration sites to mines of various sizes, 8  mills \nand 17  tailing deposits (containing a total of 52  Mt of tailings) are the result of the production of \nabout 80  000 tU. All of these sites have been remediated. Monitoring continues at only the most \nimportant sites, and 17  water treatment plants were in stalled to clean drainage from the sites. \nOrano is responsible for the management of 234 of these sites.  \nNATIONAL REPORTS: FRANCE  \n266 URA NIUM 202 2: RESOURCES, PRODUCTION AND DEMAND, NEA No. 7634, © OECD 202 3 The purpose of remediation is to:  \n• ensure public health and safety;  \n• limit the residual impact of previous activities, to as low as reasonably achievable  (ALARA) ; \n• integrate the industrial sites into landscape;  \n• maintain a dialogue and consultation with local populations;  \n• allow the reconversion of the former sites to new activities, such as tourism, industry, \nagriculture and energy (solar panels).  \nFuture pro duction centres  \nThere are no plans to develop new production centres in France in the near future.  \nSecondary sources of uranium  \nProduction and/or use of mixed oxide fuels  \nThe annual licensed capacity of MOX fuel production in France is about 195 tHM, roughly \ncorresponding to 1 560 tU equivalent (tNatU) using the recommended Red Book conversion factor. \nActual yearly production of MOX in France varies below this licensed capacity in accordance to contracted quantities. Most of the French MOX production is use d to fuel French nuclear power \nplants (a total of about 125  t/yr, or 1 000 tNatU) and the remainder is delivered abroad under long -\nterm contract arrangements.  \nProduction and/or use of reprocessed uranium  \nIn France, reprocessed uranium is produced at the la  Hague reprocessing plant. Électricité de \nFrance (EDF) produces around 1  000 tU of spent fuel annually. Reprocessed uranium was recycled \nat the EDF nuclear power plant of Cruas. The last fuel assemblies containing reprocessed uranium were loaded in 2013. E DF signed in 2018 contracts for the recycling, starting in 2023, of reprocessed \nuranium (RepU) for use in PWRs. This solution enables EDF to diversify its uranium supply sources, allowing for savings of around 10 -15% of its natural uranium requirements. It  also ensures \ncompleteness of the French nuclear cycle, by reusing 96% of the nuclear material contained in spent fuel.  \nRegulatory regime \nIn France, mines are nationally regulated according to the mining code and processing plants according to regulations specified in the legislation governing the operation of installations that \npresent environmental risks (ICPE –  installation classée pour la protection de l ’environnement ). These \nregulations are applied by regional environmental authorities (DREAL – Directi ons régi onales de \nl'Environnement, de l’ Aménagement et du Logement) on behalf of the prefect (the state \nrepresentative in a particular department or region).  \nIn order to open a mine, the mining company must present a report to the regional authorities \nthat will allow them to confirm that the project will be operated in accordance with all regulations. \nOnce this is confirmed, a public enquiry must be held. If these processes are successfully \ncompleted, the mining company will be allowed to open the mine according to requirements laid \nout in an Ordre du Préfet . When mining is completed, the mining company must prepare a report \nfor local authorities who can then give authorisation for decommissioning through an Ordre du Préfet . \n  \nNATIONAL REPORTS: FRANCE  \nURANIUM 202 2: RESOURCES, PRODUCTION AND DEMAND, NEA No. 7634, ©  OECD 20 23 267 In theory, according to the mining code, after remediation and a period of monitoring to verify \nthat there is no environmental impact, the mining company can transfer the responsibility of the \nsite to the state. However, if there is a problem, the state asks the mining company to remediate \nit. \nAfter decommissioning, the mining company retains responsibility for the site, including \nmonitoring and maintenance. There has not been a transfer of responsibility for a uranium \nmine from the mining company to the state because Orano is always pre sent. However, Orano \nis in discussions with the authorities regarding the transfer of responsibility.  \nThe cost of mine remediation is the responsibility of the mining company. In the case of \nprocessing plants (mills), local authorities request financial gu arantees for the costs of all \nremediation works and monitoring. A draft revision of the mining code is currently under \ndevelopment.  \nUranium requirements  \nFrance has 56 nuclear power reactors in operation (supplying 61  370 MWe) and 1 EPR reactor under \nconstr uction at the Flamanville site. The development strategy for nuclear power is related to the \ngoals set forth by the Energy Transition for Green Growth Act and the Multiyear Energy Plan (MEP), \npublished in April 2020. Nuclear power development will depend, in particular, on developments \nin renewable energy and decisions of the Nuclear Safety Authority regarding the potential lifetime \nextension of the existing power plants.  \nIn the MEP, a total of 14 power reactors are planned to be shut down in order to redu ce the  \nshare of nuclear in France’ s electricity generation mix from the current 75% to 50% by 2035.  \nIn 2006, Areva began work at the Tricastin site on construction of the Georges Besse  II uranium \ncentrifuge enrichment plant to replace the Eurodif gaseous d iffusion plant that had been in service \nsince 1978. In 2012, production at the Eurodif plant was stopped and the facility will be dismantled \nin the coming years. The Georges Besse  II facility successfully reached its full production capacity \nof 7.5  million  SWUs in 2016, on schedule as planned. The most recent qualification tests carried \nout have confirmed the performance capabilities of the plant’s equipment with its industrial facilities showing rates of efficiency in excess of 99%.  \nSupply and procurement strategy  \nSince France is a net importer of uranium, its policy towards procurement is one of supply diversification. French entities participate in uranium exploration and production outside France within the regulatory framework of the host countries. Ura nium is also purchased under short - or \nlong -term contracts, either from mines in which French entities have shareholdings or from \nmines operated by third parties.  \nUranium policies, uranium stocks and uranium prices  \nUranium stocks  \nEDF possesses strategic ur anium inventories, the minimum level of which has been fixed at the \nequivalent of a few years’ forward consumption to offset possible supply interruptions.  \nUranium prices  \nInformation on uranium prices is not available.  \n \nNATIONAL REPORTS: FRANCE  \n268 URA NIUM 202 2: RESOURCES, PRODUCTION AND DEMAND, NEA No. 7634, © OECD 202 3 Uranium exploration and development expenditures – non-domestic  \n(In EUR millions)  \n 2018 2019 2020 2021 (expected)  \nIndustry exploration expenditures  0 0 0 0 \nGovernment* exploration expenditures  35 30 28 27 \nIndustry development expenditures  0 0 0 0 \nGovernment* development expenditures  NA NA NA NA \nTotal expenditures  35 30 28 27 \n* Orano S.A., a state majority -owned company.

The initial phase included hydrogeochemical surveys, car -borne surveys, field \nsurveys and, to a lesser extent, airborne prospecting. Follow -up geochemical stream sediment \nsurveys, radon surveys and detailed radiometric work, followed by drilling and trenching, were \ncarried out in promising areas. During the reconnaissance and detailed exploration phases, both \nthe federal and state geological surveys were involved, whereas the actual work was carried out \nmainly by industrial companies.  \nThree deposi ts of economic interest were found: (1) the partly high -grade hydrothermal \ndeposit near Menzenschwand in the southern Black Forest, (2) the sedimentary Müllenbach deposit in the northern Black Forest, and (3) the Grossschloppen deposit in north -eastern Bav aria. \nUranium exploration ceased in Western Germany in 1988 but by then about 24  800 holes had been \ndrilled, totalling about 354  500 m. Total expenditures were on the order of USD  111 million.  \nFormer German Democratic Republic (GDR) before 1990  \nUranium exp loration and mining were undertaken from 1946 to 1953 by the Soviet stock \ncompany, SAG Wismut. These activities were centred around old mining locations of silver, cobalt, nickel, and other metals in the Erzgebirge (Ore Mountains) and in Vogtland, Saxony, where uranium had first been discovered in 1789.  \nUranium exploration had started in 1950 in the vicinity of the radium spa at Ronneburg. Using \na variety of ground -based and aerial techniques, the activities covered an extensive area of about \n55 000 km\n2 in the southern part of the GDR. About 36  000 holes in total were drilled in an area \ncovering approximately 26  000 km2. Total expenditures for uranium exploration over the life of \nthe GDR programme were on the order of  5.6 billion GDR  marks . \nUranium mining fi rst began shortly after World  War II in cobalt and bismuth mines near \nSchneeberg and Oberschlema (a former famous radium spa). During this early period more than \n100 000 people were engaged in exploration and mining activities. The rich uraninite and \npitch blende ore from the vein deposits was hand -picked and shipped to the USSR for further \nprocessing. Lower -grade ore was treated locally in small processing plants. In 1950, the central \nmill at Crossen near Zwickau, Saxony, was brought into operation.  \nIn 1954, a new joint Soviet -German stock company was created, Sowjetisch -Deutsche \nAktiengesellschaft Wismut (SDAG Wismut). The joint company was held equally by both governments. All production was shipped to the USSR for further treatment. The price for the fina l \nproduct was simply agreed upon by the two partners. Profits were used for further exploration . \nNATIONAL REPORTS: GERMANY  \nURANIUM 202 2: RESOURCES, PRODUCTION AND DEMAND, NEA No. 7634, ©  OECD 20 23 271 At the end of the 1950s, uranium mining was concentrated in the region of eastern Thuringia. \nFrom the beginning of the 1970s, the mines in eastern Thuringia pr ovided about two -thirds of \nSDAG Wismut’s annual production.  \nBetween the mid -1960s and the mid -1980s, about 45 000 people were employed by SDAG \nWismut. In the mid -1980s, Wismut’s employment decreased to about 30  000. In 1990, only \n18 000 people worked in ur anium mining and milling, and the number of employees has declined \nsince as remediation activities are completed.  \nRecent and ongoing uranium exploration and mine development activities  \nThere have been no exploration activities in reunified Germany since the end of 1990. Several \nGerman mining companies, however, did perform exploration abroad (mainly in Canada) through 1997.  \nUranium resources  \nIdentified conventional resources (reasonably assured and inferred resources)  \nIdentified conventional resources were last assessed in 1993. These identified conventional \nresources occur mainly in the closed mines that are in the process of being decommissioned. \nTheir future availability remains uncertain.  \nUndiscovered conventional resources (prognosticated and speculativ e resources)  \nAll undiscovered conventional resources are reported as speculative resources in the cost \ncategory <USD 260/kgU.  \nUnconventional resources and other materials  \nNone reported.  \nUranium production  \nHistorical review  \nFederal Republic of Germany (FRG)  before 1990  \nIn the FRG, a small (125  tonnes per year) uranium processing centre in Ellweiler, Baden -\nWürttemberg, began operating in 1960 as a test mill. It was closed on 31 May 1989 after producing \na total of about 700  tU. \nFormer German Democratic Republi c (GDR) before 1990  \nTwo processing plants were operated by SDAG Wismut in the territories of the former GDR. A plant at Crossen, near Zwickau in Saxony, started processing ore in 1950. The ore was \ntransported by road and rail from numerous mines in the Erz gebirge. The composition of the \nore from the hydrothermal deposits required carbonate pressure leaching. The plant had a maximum capacity of 2.5  million  tonnes of ore per year. Crossen was permanently closed on \n31 December 1989.  \nThe second plant at Seeling stadt, near Gera, Thuringia, started ore processing operations in \n1960 using the nearby black shale deposits. The maximum capacity of this plant was \n4.6 million  tonnes of ore per year. Silicate ore was treated by acid leaching until the end of 1989. \nCarbon ate-rich ores were treated using the carbonate pressure leaching technique. After 1989, \nNATIONAL REPORTS: GERMANY  \n272 URA NIUM 202 2: RESOURCES, PRODUCTION AND DEMAND, NEA No. 7634, © OECD 202 3 Seelingstadt’s operations were limited to the treatment of slurry produced at the Königstein \nmine using the carbonate method.  \nA total of over 200  000 tU was produced in  the GDR between 1950 and 1989.  \nStatus of production facilities, production capability, recent and ongoing activities and \nother issues  \nThere is no commercial production of uranium in Germany today. Decommissioning of the \nhistoric German production facilities started in 1989 (former FRG) and 1990 (former GDR). \nBetween 1991 and 2020, uranium recovery from mine water treatment and environmental \nrestoration amounted to a total of 2  631 tU. Since 1992, all uranium production in Germany has \nbeen derived from the clean -up operations at the Königstein mine. In 2020, conversion work of \nthe water treatment facility at the Königstein mine finally ended uranium production in \nGermany. The existing system was adapted to future requirements, whereby the technological \nproce ss phase of selective uranium separation was omitted owing to the decreasing content of \nuranium and heavy metals in the flood water in recent years. Future water treatment at the Königstein mine site will still be required but without any special separation of uranium. This \nbrings an end to uranium mining in Germany after almost 75 years.  \nOwnership structure of the uranium industry  \nThe production facilities in the former GDR were owned by the Soviet -German company Wismut \n(SDAG Wismut). After reunification,  the German Ministry of Economy inherited the ownership \nfrom SDAG Wismut. The German federal government through Wismut GmbH took responsibility \nfor the decommissioning and remediation of all production facilities.

For the first time in the modern history of Germany, a fixed deadline has been \nlaid down in law for the end of the use of nuclear power in the country. The withdrawal is to be \nundertaken in stages with specific shutdown dates.

The Ge ological Survey Department worked intensively through the \ncolonial development and welfare project No. D 2792 (Continuation & Expansion of Geological \nSurvey) from 1956 to 1960. This project made provision for the expansion of the Geological \nSurvey Departme nt to carry out intensive mineral development. In June 1958, a geologist with \nspecific experience in the geology of uranium arrived in Georgetown to organise exploratory \noperations for radioactive minerals and other key minerals such as beryllium. An occur rence of \nradioactive material discovered on the railway line under construction between Kaituma River \nand the property of the Northwest Guiana Mining Company, Ltd, was examined in some detail \nby ground and airborne surveys but proved to be euxenite –  a ref ractory mineral. Nonetheless, \ninvestigations were extended to lithium minerals required in the nuclear power industry, as well as to radioactive minerals.  \nThe Guyana Geology and Mines Commission (GGMC), established in 1979, is presently in \ncharge of geological mapping throughout Guyana. The Geological Services Division (GSD) works to help the GGMC achieve its mission to “provide effective stewardship of our mineral and \npetroleum resources by ensuring increased opportunities for development (exploration, \ndocumentation and extraction), as well as to promote and support increased investment in the \nmining and related sectors”. To examine and explore Guyana's uranium content, regional private programmes were launched.  \nThe Moruwa Formation in Guyana was first investigated by Cominco Ltd during the period \n1967 -1975. Four holes were drilled, but the venture for them was not successful (Gibbs and \nBarron, 1993\n*) even though they found high uranium -bearing lateritic conglomerate boulders in \nthe river. In the 1970s and 1980s, there were reports of possible unconformity -type uranium \ndeposits (Workman and Breede, 2012†). \nBetween 1968 and 1970, Denison Mines Corp. investigated the potential for uranium in \npalaeo -placers in the conglomerate Roraima Formation. An airborne scintillometer survey was \npart of the project. Eleven anomalies were discovered (several of them minor), and four were \nchosen for additional investigation, including diamond drilling (vertical holes). Anomalies were \nattributed to the mass impacts of cliff exp osures and thorium concentrations in sediments, but \nno significant results were found.  \nCompagnie Générale des Matières Nucléaires (“C OGEMA ”) then carried out exploration in \nGuyana from 1979 to 1984 and discovered numerous uranium prospects and showings thr ough \nsimple ground and airborne scintillometer surveys along the periphery of the basin. C OGEMA  first \nchose Mahdia and Kurupung as the bases for their stream sediment collection workers since they \nhad daily air service from Georgetown at that time. Portabl e boats and helicopters equipped with \nscintillometers were employed to conduct effective sampling of the interior of the area. They \n                                                      \n*  Gibbs, A.K. and C.N. Barron (1993), The Geology of the Guian a Shield, Oxford University Press, New York.  \n†  Workman A. and K.

These resulted in 4 and 3.5 times the background radiation, \nrespectively. C OGEMA  focused resear ch on the area between Aricheng and Anarabisi. A number \nof sub -prospects were located within this district, and they were thoroughly studied utilising \nground -based mapping, soil sampling, pitting, scintillometer surveys, and intensive drilling with \ndiamond  and percussion rigs. A number of possibilities were drilled in the Kurupung/Aricheng \narea. From stream sediments in Aricheng came the highest reading of 50 ppm uranium (0.005% U) \nin the country. Initially, 2 800 stream sediment samples were involved and 3  400 profile line \nkilometres were flown.  \nMerume, which is in the south, and Anarabisi, which is in the north, have uranium outcrops \n(uraninite and chalcocite) of 70  km spread out in eight locations (Workman and Breede, 2012). An \nassay sample from this vein  contained 3 040 ppm U (0.304% U). A total of 253 diamond drill holes \nwere drilled, with the deepest being ARNO 0001 at Aricheng North. Uranium mineralisation was identified in the Kurupung -Anarabisi granite batholith and in the Haimaraka basement shales.  \nCOGEMA  also investigated uranium in the Iwokrama Formation acid volcanics and \ndifferentiated granitoids between 1980 and 1984. In most accessible places north of the Takatu \nGraben, mainly in areas accessible by 4WD track or boat, extensive regional investigations were \ncarried out. The completed tasks included granite sampling, alluvial mud sampling, ground and \nairborne scintillometer surveys, and later, systematic grid -based airborne radiometric surveys in \na variety of regions, as well as extensive geologic al mapping and sampling. GGMC chemical data \nindicated that more U is found in stream sediments derived from granitic areas and Iwokrama \nFormation acid volcanics, and this was confirmed by C OGEMA . In GGMC stream sediments, the \nmaximum quantity of U and Th i s 27 ppm, while the maximum amount of U and Th in rocks is \n20.7 ppm (0.003% U) and 48.2 ppm, respectively. The maximum amount observed by C OGEMA  \nfrom the mud bank sample was 16  ppm U (0.0016% U). GGMC granite rock samples continued to \nshow the highest uranium values; however, four laterite samples and two hornfelsed Roraima Formation mudstone samples also contained more than 10  ppm  U (0.001% U).  \nBetween 1980 and 1983, a United Nations team investigated a carbonatite complex for rare \nearth minerals at Muri M ountain, in southern Guyana on the border with Brazil. The work \nincluded an airborne radiometric survey, radioactive and magnetic ground surveys, stream \nsediment, soil and rock sampling, as well as diamond drilling. The GGMC reported assays in \nrock of up t o 43 ppm  U (0.0043% U).  \nRecent and ongoing uranium exploration and mine development activities  \nOver the last ten years, no noteworthy uranium exploration has taken place in Guyana. However, \nthere were three uranium exploration ventures of note: Prometheus Resources (Guyana) Inc. of \nU3O8 Corp. (hereafter referred to as “ U3O8 Corp ”), a Canadian company; Pharsalus Gold Inc., a \nwholly  owned subsidiary of Australia -based Azimuth Resources Ltd and Raven Minerals Corp. \nU3O8 Corp. provided the most significant resu lts.  \nThe initial public offering of shares by U 3O8 Corp. was made in December 2006. The company \nwas given large -scale reconnaissance permissions and prospecting licences for uranium in the \nRupununi, Potaro, Mazaruni, Cuyuni and Barama River basins. Prospe cting was also undertaken \nin Kato, Monkey Mountain and Paramakatoi (Colchester and La Rose, 2010‡). Prior to this, the \ncompany’s exploration had consisted primarily of confirmatory work at some of the more \nadvanced historical prospects. This included rock chip sampling, sampling of discarded drill core, \nthin section and polished section work, and electron microprobe examination of mineralised \n                                                      \n‡  Colchester M. and J.

In 2007, exploration work included ground radiometric surveys designed to confirm \nairborne radiometric anom alies in the Kurupung batholith and to provide more detail on their \nform and location. The project covered the Kurupung batholith (granite and granodiorite) and \nsurrounding country rocks (greenstone) next to areas of the Roraima Basin (epiclastic sedimenta ry \nstrata). The initial diamond drilling was designed to twin and test mineralised intervals reported \nby C OGEMA  to the GGMC. After initial confirmation of the presence of mineralisation in the twin \nholes, drilling progressively stepped out to follow the mineralised structure along strike and \ndown -dip. More than 7  305 metres of drilling was undertaken in 51 bore holes on the Aricheng \nNorth, Arichen South and Aricheng West structures. U 3O8 Corp. resource drilling defined four \nuranium deposits in the Aricheng South, North, West and C zones of the Kurupung Project. These findings suggest that Kurupung could host a large uranium system comparable in size to other \npeer deposits such as Coles Hill in Virginia (United States), Michelin in Labrador (Canada) and \nValhalla in Queensland (Australia). Currently, however, there are no active permits for any of the \nthree companies.  \nSince U\n3O8 Corp. left Guyana in 2012, there has been no significant exploration, but the GGMC \ncontinues to conduct annual geochemical projects to map the country's mineral potential. In a bid \nto fulfil this mandate, the GSD continues to play its part in exploring geology and mineral \nresources around the country. In recent years, GGMC chemical data from the Permission for \nGeological and Geographical Survey (PGGS) areas for both light and heavy rare earth elements has \nshown that uranium levels are higher than other elements, ranging from more than 2.7 to 296  ppm \n(0.0003% U to 0.03% U). In 2020, however, no project work was done.  \nGGMC is slated to con tinue to carry out geochemical survey projects in Guyana’s interior, \nbeginning in September 2021. The majority of uranium discoveries thus far, including the \nAricheng South, West, North and C resources, will be used to identify potential targets that are \nnow being investigated in the field, in order to increase the inventory of mineralised structures \nfor future resource extension. Development of resource estimates is possible, given the \nsignificant exploratory work already undertaken.  \nUranium resources  \nIn 2012, U 3O8 Corp. estimated the uranium resources of the Aricheng structures (Kurupung area) \nin accordance with National Instrument 43 -101.  \nIdentified conventional in situ resources (reasonably assured and inferred resources)  \nStructure  Indicated  Inferred  \nOre (t)  Grade (%U)  U (t)  Ore (Mt)  Grade (%U)  U (t)  \nAricheng C  686 000  0.07  4 70  1 110 000  0.08  884 \nAricheng West  749 000  0.07  5 30  2 518 000  0.06  1 549  \nAricheng South  1 895 000  0.10  8 06  223 000  0.09  199 \nAricheng North  782 000  0.08  1 430  422 000  0.08  315 \nTotal Kurupung  4 112 000  0.08  3 236  4 273 000  0.07  2 947  \nMineral Resources were estimated using an inverse distance squared (ID2) block model, \nconstrained to a geological model with a minimum horizontal width of 2  m.

Toshaos and leaders from Region 8 complain, for example, that large -scale uranium \nand gold licences associated with U 3O8 Corp. and Mahdia Gold Corp. had a direct impact on the \nPatamona people ’s traditional lands and territory. Furthermore, th ey argue that the affected \nAmerindian villages lack basic information on these mining interests, as well as the specific \nmining and exploration intentions in Region 8.  \nMoreover, social conditions in mining villages could have received more attention. The \nGGMC, in partnership with the Ministries of Health and Education, could have developed, \nmonitored and enforced minimum acceptable standards. The GGMC could have also worked with the Ministry of Health and the Guyana Forestry Commission. To comply with the s tandards \nof the Guyanese Environmental Protection Agency (“EPA”), the existing regulations contain a \nprovision for the filing of an Exploration Plan.  \nRegulatory regime \nMining operations and environmental monitoring in Guyana are governed by the GGMC. Supp ort \nis also given by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and Guyana Forestry Commission \n(GFC).  \nThe regulatory regime for uranium mining in Guyana is the Guyana Geology and Mines \nCommission (CGMC), an independent body that regulates mining of minerals  in Guyana.  \nAll activities are covered by the following legislation:  \n• Order made under the Mining Act (No. 10 of 1989) Section 16 – This Order may be cited \nas the Guyana Geology and Mines Commission “Prospecting for Uranium, Radioactive Minerals and Rare Earth Elements” (Reservation Order 2006 that came into effect on the 23 October 2006).  \n• The M ining Act, No. 20 of 1989 (the “ Mining Act ”) grants licences and authorisation for \nmineral prospecting, mining and development, as well as geological and geophysical \ninvestigations. The GGMC reviews and approves all investment projects involving the \nextraction of mineral resources in general. The government of Guyana passed the Environmental Protection Act in 1996 that requires an environmental permit from the \nGuyana Environmental Protection Agency before a mining property can be put into \nproduction.  \nThe GGMC is tasked with promoting all development, mining and mineral exploration. It \nalso provides technical assistance and advice in mining, mineral processing, mineral u tilisation \nand marketing of mineral resources. In its current form, the commission has a remit for: \npromotion of mineral development; research in exploration, mining, and utilisation of minerals \nand mineral products; enforcement of the conditions of mining  licences; collection of rentals, \nfees, charges, levies, etc. payable under the Mining Act. The government of Guyana (GGMC) has \ngranted licences and permissions regarding mineral prospecting, mining and development as well as geological and geophysical sur veys.

The results of this work led to a geophysical exploration programme (airborne and surface radiometry) in 1953 over the western \npart of the Mecsek Mountains. The  discovery of the Mecsek deposit was made in 1954 and \nfurther work was aimed at the evaluation of the deposit and its development. The first shafts \nwere excavated in 1955 and 1956 for the mining of sections  I and II. In 1956, the Soviet -\nHungarian uranium j oint venture was dissolved and the project became the sole responsibility \nof the Hungarian state. That same year, uranium production began. Production began to decline \nin the late 80s and ended after 1998.  \nRecent and ongoing uranium exploration and mine de velopment activities  \nThe non- governmental mine development project, which started in 2007 with a focus on the \narea of the Mecsek deposit, is still in the environmental licensing phase. The Environmental \nImpact Study submitted at the end of 2017 is probably  going to be modified regarding the \nplanned production rate, following some legal actions and discussions with the environmental \nauthority. If a licence is obtained, a mining property will be established and likely merged with \nthe existing, historic mining  properties in the area.  \nUranium resources  \nHungary’s reported uranium resources are limited to those of the Mecsek deposit. The ore is hosted by Upper Permian sandstones with a thickness of up to 600  m. During Cretaceous time, the \nPermo -Triassic sandstones were folded into an anticline that makes up the framework structure \nof the Mecsek Mountains. The ore -bearing sandstone in the upper 200 m of the unit is underlain \nby a very thick Permian siltstone and covered by Lower Triassic sandstone. The thickness of the green -grey ore -bearing sandstone, locally referred to as the “prod uctive complex”, varies from \n15 to 90  m. The ore minerals include uranium oxides and silicates associated with pyrite and \nmarcasite.  \nIdentified conventional resources (reasonably assured and inferred resources)  \nAfter the completion of the non -governmental exploration in the Mecsek Mountains in 2017, the \nMining and Geological Survey of Hungary updated the in situ uranium resources of Hungary. As \nof 1 January 2021, the identified convention al resources amounted to a total of 22  230 in situ tU \n(16 673 recoverable tU) according to the Hungarian National Mineral Resource Inventory, a 23.9% \nincrease compared to the amount reported in the previous four editions of the Red Book (note all \nare infer red resources; no reasonably assured resources [RAR] are reported).  \nUndiscovered conventional resources (prognosticated and speculative resources)  \nThe updated prognosticated resources amount to a total of 14  845 in situ tU, a 10.6% increase \ncompared to the  amount reported in the previous four editions of the Red Book. These resources \nare tributary to the former Mecsek production centre.

The mine began operation in 1956 and produced ore from a depth \nof 100 to 1 100 m unt il it was ultimately shut down in 1997. During operation, it produced about \n500 000-600 000 tonnes ore/yr with an average mining recovery of 50 -60%. The ore processing \nplant had a capacity of 1  300 to 2 000 tonnes ore/day and employed radiometric sorting, \nagitation acid leach (and alkaline heap leaching) with ion -exchange recovery. The nominal \nproduction capacity of the plant was about 700  tU/yr.  \nThe Mecsek mine consisted of five sections with the following history:  \n• section I: operating from 1956 to 1971;  \n• section II: operating from 1956 to 1988;  \n• section III: operating from 1961 to 1993;  \n• section IV: operating from 1971 to 1997;  \n• section V: operating from 1988 to 1997.  \nThe ore processing plant became operational in 1963. Prior to its operation, 1.2  million \ntonn es of unprocessed ore were shipped to the Sillimae metallurgy plant in Estonia. After 1963, \nprocessed uranium concentrates were shipped directly to the former Soviet Union.  \nMining and milling operations were shut down at the end of 1997 because changes in market \nconditions made the operation uneconomic. Throughout its operational history, total production from the Mecsek mine and mill, including heap leaching, amounted to about 21  000 tU. \nStatus of production capability  \nSince the closure of the Mecsek mine in late 1997, the only production of uranium in Hungary has been as a by- product recovery of water treatment activities (see item (3) in the next paragraph), \namounting to a total of about 2 -6 tU/yr. During this reporting period 3 -4 tU/yr were recovered. \nSection III of the historic mine workings below the water drainage horizon (formerly the main \nhaulage adit) was completely flooded, and it is expected that Sections II -IV-V will be flooded by \n2024.  \nEnvironmental activities and socio -cultural issues  \nClosure a nd large -scale site remediation activities at the Mecsek uranium production centre \nwere carried out between 1998 and 2008. The remediation consisted of: (1) removing several \nhundred thousand tonnes of contaminated soil from various areas around the site to  an on -site \ndisposal facility, (2) remediation of tailing ponds and waste rock piles by the placement of \nisolating soil covers, and (3) abandonment and closure of underground mine workings, as well \nas groundwater extraction and treatment. Although the larg e-scale remediation programme \nwas completed by the end of 2008, long -term care activities –  such as groundwater remediation, \nenvironmental monitoring and maintenance of the engineered disposal systems –  will likely \nneed to continue for some years to come. In 2019, the soil cover of two abandoned waste rock dumps was improved by increasing its thickness to 1  m, and some areas with increased \nradiation were covered with an isolating soil layer. In addition, a new groundwater monitoring \nwell has been installed,  with another to be completed in 2021, and 5- 6 historic exploration drill \nsites have been remediated.  \nSince July 2016, long- term care of Hungarian uranium mining and ore processing legacy \nsites is under the direct responsibility of the Mining Property Util ization Company in the Public \nInterest ( www.bvh.hu ). As the legal successor of the former Mecsek mine (a state- owned \nventure), it is responsible for paying compensation, including damages for occupational disease, income a nd pension supplements, reimbursements of certified costs and dependent expenses \nNATIONAL REPORTS: HUNGARY  \n284 URA NIUM 202 2: RESOURCES, PRODUCTION AND DEMAND, NEA No. 7634, © OECD 202 3 to people formerly engaged in uranium mining.

There is no special regulation dedicated to \nuranium mining; the general mining law applies to uranium ore production. In the past, the \nregional mining offices granted uranium exploration and production licences. Currently, the only \nway to obtain a new uranium exploration or production right (concession) is through public tendering, provided that the government decides to start such a procedure. In addition to t he \nmining licence or concession, a number of other licences have to be obtained, such as \nenvironmental and land utilisation licences.  \nThe mining companies, including uranium ore producers, must have financial guarantees \nsupported by detailed expense calcul ations to cover the mine closure and decommissioning \ncosts. The guarantees are checked and monitored by the Mining Authority.  \nUranium requirements  \nIn January 2020, the government approved the new National Energy Strategy 2030 and the \nNational Energy and Cl imate Plan, and opted for the long -term maintenance of nuclear in the \nenergy mix. In 2020, the MVM Paks Nuclear Power Plant (Paks Nuclear Power Plant) generated \n16 054 GWh electricity, which accounted for 48% of gross electricity generation and 35.6% of \ndomestic electricity consumption. The 2020 Unit Capability Factor was as follows: Unit 1: 87.9%; \nUnit 2: 91.3%; Unit 3: 93.1%; Unit 4: 83.1%, giving an average for the plant of 90.9%.  \nThe licensing procedure for the lifetime extension of the P aks nuclear pow er plant from 30  to \n50 years has been fully completed. Regarding the two new units planned, the construction licence \napplication was submitted to the Hungarian Atomic Energy Authority (HAEA) on 30  June  2020. The \nauthority has 12 months to carry out the det ermination, with a p ossible extension of 3 months.  \nNATIONAL REPORTS: HUNGARY  \nURANIUM 202 2: RESOURCES, PRODUCTION AND DEMAND, NEA No. 7634, ©  OECD 20 23 285 National policies relating to uranium  \nSince the shutdown of the Hungarian uranium mining industry in 1997, there have been no \nuranium -related policies. The Energy Mineral Resources Utilisation and Stock Ma nagement Action \nPlan summarises the available Hungarian uranium resources. It concludes that if uranium ore \nmining is profitable, the government should consider partnerships with private investors in \nmining, through state -owned companies. However, there is  at present no government measure \nor action planned to facilitate mining.  \nUranium stocks  \nThe by -product (UO 4∙2H 2O) of the water treatment activities at the former uranium mining and \nore processing site (see the environmental activities above) is stored at the mine water treatment \nfacility until export. At the end of 2020, the inventory amounted to 9  473 kgU.

The first report of uranium in India was in 1913 when an occurrence \nof gummite (altered uraninite) and a 36 -pound pure uraninite nodule was discovered from a \npegmatite at Bihar.   \nIn India, exploration for uranium is carried out by the Atomic Minerals Directorate for \nExploration and Research (AMD). The AMD emerged from a dedicated wing of the Survey of \nIndia (GSI) named the Rare Minerals Survey Unit (RMSU) created during the Second World War (1939- 1945). Subsequently, after the promulgation of the Atomic Energy Act and the constitution \nof the Atomic Energy Commission (AEC) in 1948, the RMSU was brought under the AEC during 1949.  \nThe first extensive surveys for uranium began in 1949 in the Singhbhum Shear Zone (SSZ) and \nthe first exploratory drilling for uranium commenced in 1951 in Jaduguda in the SSZ. Until the \nmid-1970s, uranium exploration was mainly confined t o uranium provinces in the SSZ, Jharkhand, \nand in the Umra- Udaisagar area in the Aravalli Fold Belt in Rajasthan, targeting vein- type \nmineralisation. This resulted in the discovery of 16 low -grade uranium deposits of varying sizes \nin the SSZ, Jharkhand, an d one deposit at Umra, Rajasthan. Exploratory mining commenced in \nJaduguda as well as in Umra in 1957. Seven out of the sixteen deposits in the SSZ are under \nexploitation. Exploration is currently being carried out in several sectors of the 200  km long SSZ , \nespecially in the central and southern sectors.  \nThe introduction of airborne surveys during the late 1950s was a boon to the exploration \nactivities of AMD. India has been one of the pioneers in using airborne surveys for uranium exploration. AMD commenc ed airborne surveys in 1955 with an indigenously designed and \ndeveloped total gamma -ray count system to cover large areas of the country.  \nUranium exploration was expanded to other favourable geological domains, which resulted \nin establishing several small uranium deposits such as Bodal and Bhandaritola, Chhattisgarh, in \nPaleoproterozoic amphibolites; Jajawal, Chhattisgarh, in Paleoproterozoic sheared migmatites of \nthe Chhotanagpur Granite Gneiss Complex; and Walkunji, Karnataka, in basal quartz -pebble \ncongl omerates of the Dharwar Group.  \nDuring the mid -1970s, exploration targeted sandstone -type uranium deposits. The \nexploration for sandstone -type uranium mineralisation resulted in the discovery of a high -\ngrade, medium -tonnage deposit at Domiasiat (Kylleng -Pyndengsohiong -Mawthabah) in the \nCretaceous sandstones of the Meghalaya. Exploration in contiguous sectors has established \nseveral small uranium deposits.  \nDuring the mid -1980s, a low -grade, stratabound deposit hosted by dolostones of the Vempalle \nFormation was established at Tummalapalle, Andhra Pradesh, in the Proterozoic Cuddapah Basin. \nSince the dolostone ore was not amenable to conventional leaching procedures in vogue at that \ntime, exploration in this sector was discontinued. However, the development of  an economically \nviable alkali pressure leaching process rejuvenated the exploration activities in the Vempalle \nFormation along the southern part of the Cuddapah Basin, targeting carbonate -hosted uranium \nmineralisation. Intensive multi- parametric explorati on carried out in Tummalapalle and adjacent \nNATIONAL REPORTS: INDIA  \nURANIUM 202 2: RESOURCES, PRODUCTION AND DEMAND, NEA No. 7634, ©  OECD 20 23 289 sectors led to the identification of substantial uranium resources in the southern part of the \nCuddapah Basin . The Tummalapalle uranium deposit is under exploitation.  \nDuring the early 1990s, a near -surface deposi t was discovered adjacent to the unconformity \ncontact between basement granites and the overlying Mesoproterozoic Srisailam Quartzite at \nLambapur,  Telangana (Andhra Pradesh) . These occurrences were investigated and several \nexploration areas were subsequent ly identified. Favourable geological criteria and sustained \nexploration efforts resulted in establishing deposits at Peddagattu and Chitrial along the \nunconformity contact between the basement granites and overlying quartzites of the Srisailam \nFormation. Exploration in the adjacent Palnad Sub -basin identified a small deposit at \nKoppunuru. Exploration is continuing in the Palnad Sub -basin.  \nSustained exploration in the North Delhi Fold Belt (NDFB), in parts of Rajasthan and Haryana, \ntargeting metasomatic -type uranium mineralisation, led to the discovery of the Rohil uranium \ndeposit, Rajasthan. Exploration is being carried out in various sectors of the ~200 km long \n“Albitite Line” in Rajasthan and Haryana.  Intensive exploration in adjacent sectors of Rohil \nestablished another deposit in Jahaz, Rajasthan.  \nDuring the late 1990s, multi -parametric exploration in the Neoproterozoic Bhima Basin led \nto establishing a medium -grade and small tonnage uranium deposit in Gogi, Karnataka, hosted \nby brecciated limestone and granite along the Gogi -Kurlagare -Gundahalli fault located in the \nsouthern part of the basin. Sustained exploration in this geological domain has established \nanother uranium deposit in Kanchankayi.  \nStarting in the 2010s, AMD identified substantial uranium r esources. Exploration has been \nsupported by state -of-the-art hydrostatic drilling rigs, analytical equipment, and the acquisition \nof high -resolution heliborne - and ground -based geophysical data over favourable geological \ndomains in the country.   \nRecent and ongoing uranium  exploration and mine development activities  \nIn the past few years, exploration activities have been concentrated in the following areas:  \n• Proterozoic Cuddapah Basin, Andhra Pradesh and Telangana.  \n• Mesoproterozoic Singhbhum Shear Zone, Jharkh and.  \n• Mesoproterozoic North Delhi Fold Belt, Rajasthan and Haryana.  \n• Cretaceous Mahadek Basin, Meghalaya.  \n• Neoproterozoic Bhima Basin, Karnataka.  \n• Mesoproterozoic Kaladgi Basin, Karnataka.  \n• Mesozoic Satpura Gondwana Basin, Madhya Pradesh.  \n• Mesoproterozoic Chhota nagpur Granite Gneiss Complex, Uttar Pradesh, Madhya Pradesh \nand Jharkhand state.  \n• Cenozoic Siwalik Group, Himachal Pradesh.  \n• Proterozoic Aravalli Fold Belt, Rajasthan.  \n• Other geological domains with potential are under active exploration such as the: \nbasemen t fractures surrounding the southern part of Cuddapah Basin, Andhra Pradesh; \nShillong Basin, Assam; basement crystalline terrain, Arunachal Pradesh; Vindhyan, \nBijawar and Chhattisgarh basins, Uttar Pradesh, Madhya Pradesh, and Chhattisgarh \nstates; Kotri -Dongargarh belt, Chhattisgarh.  \n• Extensive exploration including ground and heliborne geophysical (ZTEM, TDEM, \nmagnetic and radiometric), ground geological, radiometric and geochemical surveys, and \ndrilling are planned in other geological domains of the count ry that have the potential \nto host uranium mineralisations.  \nNATIONAL REPORTS: INDIA  \n290 URA NIUM 202 2: RESOURCES, PRODUCTION AND DEMAND, NEA No. 7634, © OECD 202 3 Proterozoic Cuddapah Basin, Andhra Pradesh and Telangana \nThe Cuddapah Basin (Paleo - to Neoproterozoic) of the Dharwar Craton of Southern Peninsular \nIndia is one of the major uranium provinces host ing uranium mineralisation at various \nstratigraphic levels. Three types of uranium mineralisation/deposits have been identified in the \nCuddapah Basin: carbonate -hosted stratabound -type, unconformity -related, and  fracture -\ncontrolled.  \n Carbonate uranium deposits  \nThe southern part of the Cuddapah Basin hosts a unique, low -grade, and large -tonnage uranium \ndeposit in the dolostones of the Vempalle Formation in the Tummalapalle -Rachakuntapalle sector. \nThis formation occurs at the lower stratigraphic sequence of t he Cuddapah Basin. Uranium \nmineralisation has been traced intermittently over a strike length of 160  km from Reddipalle in \nthe north to Maddimadugu in the south- east. The vast extent of the deposit, its stratabound \nnature hosted by dolostone, and point -to-point correlation with uniform grade and thickness of \nthe mineralisation over considerable lengths along the strike and dip, make the deposit unique. \nTwo ore lodes with an average thickness of 2.30  m and 1.75  m, separated by a lean/unmineralised \nband of 3. 0 m, are under active exploration at vertical depths of up to 825  m. Sustained exploration \nactivities over the 16  km segment within the 160 km long belt have added substantial uranium \nresources. Intensive exploration in the eastern extension of the Tummala palle -Rachakuntapalle \nsector has established another sizeable ore block, named Rachakunatapalle East . Exploration is \ncontinuing in several sectors of the 16 km long belt.  \n Proterozoic unconformity uranium deposits  \nThe north- western margin of the Cuddapah Ba sin, comprising the Meso-  to Neoproterozoic \nSrisailam and Palnad Sub -Basins, are known for their potential for unconformity -related uranium \ndeposits. Intensive exploration over the past few decades in the northern part of the Srisailam \nSub- Basin had establ ished three low -tonnage, low -grade uranium deposits named Lambapur, \nPeddagattu, and Chitrial (stratiform fracture -controlled deposit subtype). Exploration efforts along \nthe northern margin of the Palnad Sub -basin have resulted in locating a low -grade and l ow-\ntonnage deposit at Koppunuru. Sustained exploration is being continued in potential sectors \nhaving a similar lithostructural setup around Sarangapalle, in the Palnad Sub -basin, to identify \nunconformity -related uranium mineralisation. Substantial dimensions of uranium mineralisation \noccurring close to the unconformity between the basement granite and Gulcheru quartzite have been established in the Kappatralla outlier.  \n Sandstone, mafic dykes/sills in Proterozoic sandstone subtype uranium deposits   \nThe Gulc heru quartzite of the Cuddapah Supergroup, overlying the basement granitoid in the \nsouthern parts of the Cuddapah Basin, are intensely fractured, faulted and intruded by east -west \ntrending basic dykes. Uranium mineralisation is associated with the quartz -chlorite -breccia \noccurring along the contact between the Gulcheru quartzite and basic dykes. Furthermore, the fracture systems within the crystalline basement, proximal to the southern and eastern margins of the Cuddapah Basin, are known to host uranium mineralisation and are currently under \nexploration (e.g.  Sivramapuram – Pincha and Kasturigattu). The fracture zones occurring within \nthe Cuddapah Basin around the basement inlier at Ipuru are also being investigated.   \nMesoproterozoic Singhbhum Shear Zone, Jh arkhand  \nThe Singhbhum Shear Zone (SSZ) is a 160  km long, arcuate belt of tectonised rocks fringing the \nnorthern boundary of the Singhbhum craton along the contact with the Singhbhum Group rocks. \nExploration efforts since the early fifties led to the identi fication of several low -grade and low - to \nmedium -tonnage uranium deposits, some of which are under active exploitation. The established \nuranium deposits are mainly located in the central and eastern sectors of the shear zone. Intensive exploration in various sectors in the SSZ has added significant resources to the uranium inventory. \nNotable among them are the Singridungri -Banadungri, Rajdah, Jaduguda North, Bangurdih and \nNarwapahar sectors . Intensive exploration is being carried out for the establishment of \npolymetallic mineralisation, including uranium in serpentinite of Proterozoic Iron Ore Group at \nKudada, Jharkhand.  \nNATIONAL REPORTS: INDIA  \nURANIUM 202 2: RESOURCES, PRODUCTION AND DEMAND, NEA No. 7634, ©  OECD 20 23 291 Mesoproterozoic North Delhi Fold Belt of Rajasthan and Haryana  \nThe metasediments of the North Delhi Fold Belt, comprising the Khetri, Alwar , and Bayana- Lalsot \nSub- Basins in the states of Rajasthan and Haryana, are the host to several uranium occurrences. \nThe approximately 200  km long north- northeast to south -southwest  NNE -SSW trending “Albitite \nLine” passing through the Delhi Supergroup and B anded Gneissic Complex is the site for extensive \nsodic metasomatism and holds great potential to host metasomatite -type uranium mineralisation. \nIntegrated exploration including litho -structural, heliborne and ground geophysics and drilling \nresulted in the discovery of a fracture -controlled metasomatite -type uranium deposit near Rohil, \nRajasthan. The entire “Albitite Line” holds immense potential for the discovery of additional \nuranium resources. Extensive ground and heliborne geophysical surveying and drill ing has been \ncarried out in several sectors along the “Albitite Line” for the delineation of metsomatite type \nuranium mineralisation. This has resulted in establishing a small tonnage uranium deposit at \nJahaz, Rajasthan. Further,  these exploration efforts have resulted in establishing promising new \nsectors in Gumansingh -Ki-Dhani, Narsinghpuri and Hurra- Ki-Dhani, in the contiguous area of \nRohil, which have similar geological settings.  \nCretaceous Mahadek Basin, Meghalaya  \nThe Upper Cretaceous Lower Mahadek For mation, exposed along the southern margin of the \nShillong plateau, Meghalaya, is a potential host for uranium mineralisation. This geological \ndomain has been under exploration since the late 1970s. Substantial exploration over the years \nled to the discover y of seven low - to medium -grade, low - to medium -tonnage, uranium deposits \nat Domiasiat, Wahkyn, Wahkut, Gomaghat, Tyrnai, Umthongkut and Lostoin.  \nNeoproterozoic Bhima Basin, Karnataka  \nThe Bhima Basin comprises calcareous sediments with minor arenaceous li thostratigraphic \nunits of the Bhima Group, which were deposited over basement granite and have been affected \nby several east -west trending faults. A small -size, medium -grade uranium deposit has been \nestablished at Gogi along the Gogi -Kurlagare -Gundahalli f ault. Intensive multi -parametric \nexploration also established another deposit at Kanchankayi, Karnataka, adjacent to the Gogi uranium deposit. Current exploration efforts are concentrated in the eastern extensions of the Kanchankayi sector, around Hulkal, along the north -eastern extensions of the Gogi uranium \ndeposit.  \nPalaeozoic – Mesozoic Satpura Gondwana Basin, Madhya Pradesh  \nThe Gondwana age sedimentary basins of India comprise a suitable environment for hosting \nsandstone -type uranium mineralisation. The  lower Motur Formation of the Satpura Gondwana \nBasin of Central India has been identified as the potential geological domain for hosting \nsandstone -type uranium mineralisation. Extensive surface and subsurface exploration in the \nMotur Formation has delineat ed significant uranium mineralisation in the Dharangmau – \nKachhar sector. Exploration is continuing in this geological domain.  \nMesoproterozoic Kaladgi Basin, Karnataka  \nThe east -west trending Meso -Neoproterozoic Kaladgi Basin is located on the north -western  \nmargin of the western Dharwar Craton. The unmetamorphosed sediments of the Kaladgi \nSupergroup overlie the basement granitoids and Chitradurga schists. The northern and western \nextensions of the basin are covered by the Deccan Traps. The basement is compri sed of schist \nbelts with slivers of graphite -bearing meta -pelites and granites with associated tectonism. \nSignificant surface uranium mineralisation over a considerable extent hosted by arenites has been identified near Deshnur. Subsurface exploration in t he western part of Kaladgi Basin led \nto the emergence of another prospective sector in the Suldhal -Gujanal -Malarmardi area, where \nuranium mineralisation is hosted by the lower conglomerate, basal arenite and basement schist close to the unconformity.  \nNATIONAL REPORTS: INDIA  \n292 URA NIUM 202 2: RESOURCES, PRODUCTION AND DEMAND, NEA No. 7634, © OECD 202 3 Mesop roterozoic Chhotanagpur Granite Gneissic Complex (CGGC), Uttar Pradesh, Madhya \nPradesh and Jharkhand  \nThe Chhotanagpur Granite Gneiss Complex (CGGC) forms part of the prominent Mesoproterozoic \nlinear mobile belt in East and Central India lying between the N armada- Son-Brahmaputra \nlineaments designated as the “Central Indian Tectonic Zone” (CITZ) in the North and the Central \nIndian Suture (CIS) to the south. The CGGC hosts a thick pile of arkosic to psammo- pelitic \nmetasediments that has undergone multiple phas es of tectonic, plutonic, thermal and \nmetamorphic events, which resulted in the extensive development of migmatites. The exposed \nrocks include banded gneisses and metasedimentary enclaves, overlain by the Mahakoshal \nsupracrustals and sediments of the Vindh yan Supergroup in the north and Gondwana Supergroup \nin the south. Uranium mineralisation within migmatites is hosted by varied lithological units \nspread over a large area (350 km2) in the Son valley crystallines, in the north -western part of the \nCGGC. Inte nsive exploration is being carried out in potential blocks at Naktu, Kudar, Kudri, Jhapar, \nKurludih and Anjangira, where the host rock is essentially an albite -rich pegmatoid leucosome \nmobilizate (PLM).   \nCenozoic Siwalik Basin, Himachal Pradesh  \nThe Siwalik  Group constitutes a thick sequence of molasse deposits laid down in a long narrow \nfore-deep, formed to the south of the rising Himalayas during the Middle Miocene to the \nPleistocene. The sediments are traceable in India from Jammu in the west to the Brahm aputra \nvalley in the east. Multi -parametric exploration has helped in identifying numerous uranium \noccurrences spread over the entire Siwalik belt between Poonch (Jammu and Kashmir) in the west and Tanakpur (Uttar Pradesh) in the east. More than 350 uraniu m occurrences forming eight major \nclusters have been identified. The majority of these occurrences are confined to three distinct stratigraphic horizons: 1) lower part of Upper Siwaliks; 2) upper part of Middle Siwaliks; and 3) upper part of Lower Siwaliks . The important uranium zones identified are: 1)  Maler in Jammu \nand Kashmir; 2) Astotha- Khya- Loharian; 3) Galot -Andalada– Sibal -Loharkar; 4) Rajpura- Polian; \n5) Romehra in Himachal Pradesh; 6) Morni -Nathai in Haryana; 7) Naugajiya Rao -Sanbarsot -\nSakhumbari Ra o; and 8) Kathaul -Danaur -Kholgarh in Uttar Pradesh. Among these, the Rajpura-\nPolian and Sibal -Loharkar sectors, Himachal Pradesh, where uranium mineralisation is hosted by \nsediments of the upper part of Middle Siwalik, are under active exploration.  \nProter ozoic Aravalli Fold Belt, Rajasthan  \nThe Aravalli Supergroup (ASG) occupies the eastern part of the Aravalli Mountain Range from \nNathdwara in the north to Champaner in the south over a distance of approximately 350  km with \na width varying from 40  km to 150 km. It has an arcuate form with a northeast -southwest trend \nin the north, north- south in Udaipur and northwest -southeast in the south. The ASG can be \ndivided into two distinct sedimentary facies: (1) the shelf facies, comprising mafic volcanic, coarse clastics and carbonates accumulated in the epicontinental sea along the pericontinental slope, \nand (2) the carbonate -free deep -sea facies, comprising dominantly metapelites with bands of \nquartzite. The ASG has undergone polyphase deformation and witnessed thre e main events of \nmagmatism. The Aravalli Fold Belt is known for its uranium metallogeny of different styles among \nwhich uranium mineralisation associated with carbon phyllite is the most promising. Several anomalies have been located at the Umra, Udaisagar , Kalamagra, Haldughati, Sukher, Oda- Kevda \nand Undwala areas. Multi -parametric exploration is ongoing in the Umra area.  \n  \nNATIONAL REPORTS: INDIA  \nURANIUM 202 2: RESOURCES, PRODUCTION AND DEMAND, NEA No. 7634, ©  OECD 20 23 293 Uranium resources  \nIdentified conventional resources (reasonably assured and inferred resources)  \nIndia’s known conventional in situ uranium resources (reasonably assured resources and inferred) \nare estimated to be 292 867 tU (in situ) hosted in the following deposit types:  \nDeposit t ype  In situ r esource (tU)  Proportion of dep osits  \nCarbonate  163 655 tU  56%  \nMetamorphite  72 615 tU  25% \nSandstone  20 528 tU  7% \nProterozoic Unconformity  18 072 tU  6% \nMetasomatic  11 804 tU  4% \nGranite -related  5 841 tU  2% \nPaleo -quartz -pebble -conglomerate  352 tU  <1% \nTotal  292 867 tU  100%  \n \nAs of 1  January 2021, the known conventional in situ resources include 2 82 401 tU of \nreasonably assured resources (RAR) and 10 466 tU of inferred resources (IR). This amounts to a \nsubstantial increase in RAR, compared to what was reported for the Red Book 2020. These \nchanges are mainly due to appreciable resource additions in the contiguous area of the \nstratabound deposit in the southern part of the Cuddapah Basin and the extension areas of \nknown deposits in the Singhbhum Shear Zone, Bhima Basin and North Delhi Fold Belt.  \nUndiscovered conventional resources (prognosticated and speculative resources)  \nIn parts of Andhra Pradesh, Meghalaya, Rajasthan, Jharkhand and Karnataka, potential areas for \nuranium resources were re -evaluated with a higher degree of confidence. As of 1  January 2021, \nundiscovered resource estimates increased t o 144 160 tU under the prognosticated category and \n55 360 tU under the speculative category, both as in situ resources.  \nThe increase in the prognosticated resources category from 127 200 tU in 2019 to 144  160 tU in \n2021 is mainly due to the greater degree of confidence obtained by carrying out multidisciplinary \nexploration in some of the potential geological domains, such as the Southern Cuddapah Basin, Andhra Pradesh; Singhbhum Shear Zone, Jharkhand, and Bhima Basin, Karnataka; North Delhi Fold Belt, Raja sthan; Satpura Gondwana Basin, Madhya Pradesh; Chhotanagpur Granite Gneiss \nComplex, Uttar Pradesh; Madhya Pradesh and Jharkhand and Siwalik Group, Himachal Pradesh.  \nSimilarly, the increase in the speculative resources category from 55 120 tU in 2019 to 59 360 tU \nin 2021 is mainly due to the identification of potential exploration targets in several geological \ndomains, namely: Satpura Gondwana basin, Madhya Pradesh; Proterozoic basins such as \nVindhyan, Bijawar, Chhattisgarh and Shillong Basins, Madhya Prades h, Chhattisgarh, Assam and \nMeghalaya; Kaladgi Basin, Karnataka; Aravalli Fold Belt, Rajasthan, etc.  \nUranium production  \nHistorical review  \nThe Uranium Corporation of India Ltd (UCIL) was formed in October 1967 under the administrative control of the Departme nt of Atomic Energy, Government of India. The UCIL operates six \nunderground uranium mines (Jaduguda, Bhatin, Narwapahar, Turamdih, Bagjata, and Mohuldih) \nand one open- pit mine (Banduhurang in Singhbhum East district of Jharkhand state). The ore \nproduced fr om the mines is processed in two processing plants located at Jaduguda and Turamdih. \nNATIONAL REPORTS: INDIA  \n294 URA NIUM 202 2: RESOURCES, PRODUCTION AND DEMAND, NEA No. 7634, © OECD 202 3 All of these facilities are located in a multi- metal mineralised sector –  the Singhbhum Shear Zone \nin the eastern part of India. In addition to these, UCIL has also constr ucted a uranium mine and a \nprocessing plant in the YSR district (formerly Kadapa) of Andhra Pradesh.  \nStatus of production facilities, production capability, recent and ongoing activities and \nother issues  \nThe total installed capacity of UCIL’s three operati ng production plants is as follows:  \n• Jaduguda Plant: 2  500 t ore/day;  \n• Turamdih Plant: 3  000 t ore/day;  \n• Tummalapalle Plant: 3  000 t ore/day.  \nRecent and ongoing activities  \nJaduguda mine  \nThe Jaduguda uranium deposit lies within the metasediments of the Singhbhum Shear Zone. The \nhost rocks are of Proterozoic age. There are two prominent parallel ore lenses: the Footwall lode \n(FWL) and the Hangingwall lode (HWL). These lodes are separated by a 100  m barren zone. The \nFWL extends over a strike length of about 600 m in a south -east to north -west direction. The strike \nlength of HWL is about 250 m and is confined to the eastern part of the deposit. Both the lodes \nhave an average dip of 40  degrees towards the north -east. Of the two lodes, the FWL is better \nmineralised. The Jaduguda deposit has been explored up to a depth of 880 m. \nEntry to the mine is through a 640  m deep vertical shaft. An underground auxiliary vertical \nshaft, sunk from 555  m to 905  m, provides access to deeper levels. The cut -and-fill stoping \nmethod is  practised, giving about 80% ore recovery. De -slimed mill tailings are used as backfill \nmaterial. Ore is hoisted by the skip in stages through shafts to surface and sent to the Jaduguda mill by conveyor for further processing.  \nBhatin mine  \nThe Bhatin uraniu m deposit is located 4  km north -west of Jaduguda. A  major strike -slip fault lies \nbetween the Jaduguda and Bhatin deposits. Both of the deposits lie in similar geological settings. The Bhatin mine began production in 1986. The ore lens has a thickness of 2 to 10  m with an \naverage dip of 35 degrees and entry to the mine is through an adit, with deeper levels accessed by inclines. Cut -and-fill stoping is practised and deslimed mill tailings from the Jaduguda mill are \nused as backfill. Broken ore is trucked to the Jaduguda mill. UCIL has planned for increasing underground productivity of this mine by further mechanising its working methods.  \nNarwapahar mine  \nThe Narwapahar deposit (about 12  km west of Jaduguda) has been operating since 1995. In this \ndeposit, discr ete uraninite grains occur within chlorite -quartz schist with associated magnetite, \nwith several lenticular -shaped ore lenses extending over a strike length of about 2 100 m, each \nwith an average north- easterly dip of 30 to 40 degrees. The thickness of the individual ore lenses \nvaries from 2.5 to 20 m. The deposit is accessed by a 355 metre -deep vertical shaft and a 7 -degree \ndecline from the surface. Cut -and-fill stoping is also practised using deslimed mill tailings of the \nJaduguda plant as backfill. Ore i s trucked to the Jaduguda plant for processing.  \nTuramdih mine  \nThe Turamdih deposit is located about 12  km west of Narwapahar. Discrete uraninite grains \nwithin feldspathic -chlorite schist form a series of ore lenses with a very erratic configuration. \nThe mi ne was commissioned in 2003 and three levels (70 m, 100  m, and 140  m depth) have been \naccessed through an 8 -degree decline from the surface and a vertical shaft has been sunk to \nprovide access to deeper levels. Ore from this mine is processed at the Turamd ih plant. Cut -\nand-fill stoping is also practised using deslimed mill tailings of the Turamdih plant. Considering \nNATIONAL REPORTS: INDIA  \nURANIUM 202 2: RESOURCES, PRODUCTION AND DEMAND, NEA No. 7634, ©  OECD 20 23 295 the ore geometry, possibilities of adopting sub -level stoping methods in specific segments of \nthe orebody are being explored with higher produc tivity. Trial stoping in one such area has been \nundertaken.  \nBagjata mine  \nThe Bagjata deposit, situated about 26  km east of Jaduguda, has been developed as an \nunderground mine with a 7 -degree decline for entry and a vertical shaft to access deeper levels. \nThis mine was commissioned in 2008. Ore from the Bagjata mine is transported by road to the \nJaduguda plant for processing. Cut -and-fill stoping is practised in the Bagjata mine and \ndeslimed mill tailings from the Jaduguda mill are used as backfill.  \nBanduhur ang mine  \nThe Banduhurang deposit has been developed as a large opencast mine. The orebody is the \nwestern extension of ore lenses at Turamdih. The mine was commissioned in 2009 and ore is \ntransported by road to the Turamdih plant for processing.  \nMohuldih mi ne \nThe deposit is located in the Seraikela -Kharswan district of Jharkhand, about 2.5  km west of \nBanduhurang. The mine was commissioned in 2012. The ore from the mine is treated at the Turamdih plant.  \nTummalapalle mine  \nHosted in carbonate rock, this deposit  is located in the YSR district (formerly Kadapa) of Andhra \nPradesh. It is the first uranium production centre in the country located outside Jharkhand. This \nunderground mine is accessible by three declines along the apparent dip of the orebody. The \ncentra l decline is equipped with a conveyor for ore transport and the other two declines are \nused as service paths. The ore is treated in the plant adjacent to the mine at Tummalapalle. The \nexpansion of the mine and processing plant at Tummalapalle has been plan ned to augment \nuranium production.  \nJaduguda mill  \nOre produced at the Jaduguda, Bhatin, Narwapahar and Bagjata mines is processed in the mill \nlocated at Jaduguda. Commissioned in 1968, the mill is capable of treating about 2  500 t/day \nof dry ore. Following crushing and grinding to 60% (passing 200 mesh), the ore is leached in \npachuca tanks using sulphuric acid under controlled pH and temperature. After filtration of the pulp, ion -exchange resin is used to recover the uranium. After elution, the product is \nprecipitated using hydrogen peroxide to produce uranium peroxide as a final product \ncontaining about 88%  U\n3O8. The treatment of mine water and reclaiming tailings water has \nresulted in reduced freshwater requirements, as well as increasing the purity of the final \neffluent. A magnetite recovery plant is also in operation at Jaduguda producing very fine -\ngrained magnetite as a by -product.  \nTuramdih mill  \nUranium ore from the Turamdih and Banduhurang mines is being processed in the Turamdih mill. The mill, commissi oned in 2009, is capable of treating about 3 000 t/day dry ore. The plant \nadopts similar processing technology as that of Jaduguda. Presently, this plant produces \nmagnesium diuranate as the final product. Plans to produce uranium peroxide as the final \nproduct is under implementation. This plant is being expanded to process 4  500 t/day dry ore.  \nTummalapalle mill  \nThe uranium processing plant at Tummalapalle in the YSR district (formerly Kadapa) of Andhra \nPradesh is based on indigenously developed alkali leach ing (under high temperature and \npressure) technology. The plant was put into regular operation in January 2017 to process \n3 000 t/day ore. The expansion of this plant to process 4  500 t/day ore has also been planned.  \nNATIONAL REPORTS: INDIA  \n296 URA NIUM 202 2: RESOURCES, PRODUCTION AND DEMAND, NEA No. 7634, © OECD 202 3  \nUranium production centre technical d etails  \n     Centre #8  \nTummalapalle  \nExisting  \n2017  \nUranium ore  \nTummalapalle  \nCarbonate (Strata bound)  \n- \n- \n \nUG \n3 000 (4 500 planned)  \n60 \nTummalapalle  \nALKPL*  \n3 000  \n70 \n211 \nTummalapalle mine (4 500 TPD) \nand Tummalapalle plant \n(4 500 TPD) are und er expansion  \n \n* Pressurised alkali leach.

The uranium industry is wholly owned by the Department of Atomic Energy, Government of India. The At omic Minerals Directorate for Exploration and Research under the \nDepartment of Atomic Energy is responsible for uranium exploration programmes in India. Following the discovery and deposit delineation, the economic viability is evaluated. The evaluation st age may also include exploratory mining. Once a deposit of sufficient tonnage and \ngrade is established, UCIL initiates activities for commercial mining and production of uranium concentrates.  \nEmployment in the uranium industry  \nAbout 5  000 people are engaged in uranium mining and milling activities.  \nFuture production centres  \nThe uranium deposit located at Gogi in the Yadgir (former name Gulbarga) district, Karnataka, is \nplanned for development as an underground mine. Exploratory mining work is in progress to \nestablish the configuration of the orebody. The plant at Gogi will utilise alkali leaching technology.  \nA sandstone uranium deposit in the north -eastern part of the country at Kylleng -\nPyndengsohiong, Mawthabah (formerly Domiasiat) in West Khasi Hills Distr ict, Meghalaya \nState, is planned for development by open- pit mining, with a processing plant to be situated \nnear the mine.  \nNATIONAL REPORTS: INDIA  \n298 URA NIUM 202 2: RESOURCES, PRODUCTION AND DEMAND, NEA No. 7634, © OECD 202 3 Uranium deposits located at Lambapur -Peddagattu  in the Nalgonda district, Andhra \nPradesh, are also slated for development, with an op en-pit and three underground mines \nproposed. An ore processing plant is being proposed at Seripally, 50  km from the mine site. Pre -\nproject activities are in progress.  \nEnvironmental activities and socio -cultural issues  \nThere are no environmental issues rela ted to the existing uranium mines and processing plants \noperated by UCIL. However, provisions are made for the management of environmental impacts. \nThe organisation responsible for this task is the Health Physics Group of the Bhabha Atomic Research Centre,  located in Mumbai. It carries out environmental health monitoring for radiation, \nradon and dust at uranium production facilities. The Health Physics Unit operates the Environmental Survey Laboratory at Jaduguda and has establishments at all operating faci lities.  \nRegulatory regime \nIn India, all nuclear activities, including mining of uranium or other atomic minerals, fall within \nthe purview of the central government and are governed by the Atomic Energy Act, 1962 (AE Act) \nand regulations made thereunder. Th e Department of Atomic Energy (DAE) oversees the \ndevelopment and mining of uranium and other atomic minerals. Accordingly, policies of the \nDAE and provisions of the AE Act and regulations framed thereunder play a key role in the \nprospecting, exploration an d mining of uranium. The exploration and mining of uranium are \ngoverned under the provisions of the Mines Act, 1952 and Mines and Minerals (Development and Regulation) Act, 1957 as well as rules made thereunder i.e.  Atomic Minerals Concession \nRules (AMCR),  2016 and Mineral Conservation and Development Rules (MCDR), 2017. In addition, \nall mining activities must comply with environmental regulations. The mining, milling and processing of uranium ore require a licence under the AE Act. The Atomic Energy Radiat ion \nProtection Rules (2004) and the Atomic Energy Working of Mines and Minerals and Handling of \nPrescribed Substances Rules (1984) provide procedural details for obtaining a licence and specify \nconditions required to carry out these activities.  \nA mining le ase for uranium is granted by the state government after the mining plan is \napproved by the Atomic Minerals Directorate for Exploration and Research as per the provisions of the MMDR Act. The Atomic Energy Regulatory Board (AERB), an independent authority,  \nregulates the safety and other regulatory provisions under the AE Act and ensures the safety of \nworkers, the public and the environment. The AERB oversees various aspects of a mining plan \nthat are required to conform to radiological safety, siting of the mill, disposal of tailings and \nother waste rocks, as well as decommissioning the facility. The opening, operating and \ndecommissioning of uranium mines require compliance with the provisions under different \nlegislation and regulations.  \nUranium requirements  \nAs of 1 January 2021, the total installed nuclear capacity in India was 6  780 MWe (gross), which \nis comprised of 18 pressurised heavy water reactors, two boiling water reactors and two light -\nwater reactors.  \nConstruction/commissioning of four pressurised h eavy water reactors (KAPP 3 and 4: 2 x \n700 MWe and Rajasthan Atomic Power Station 7 and 8: 2 x 700 MWe), and one prototype fast \nbreeder (500 MWe) is in progress.  \nAnnual uranium requirements in 2020 amounted to about 1 350  tU and this would increase \nin tand em with increases in installed nuclear capacity. Identified conventional uranium \nresources are sufficient to support 10 -15 GWe installed capacity of pressurised heavy water \nreactors operating at a lifetime capacity factor of 80% for 40 years.  \n  \nNATIONAL REPORTS: INDIA  \nURANIUM 202 2: RESOURCES, PRODUCTION AND DEMAND, NEA No. 7634, ©  OECD 20 23 299 With intern ational co- operation in peaceful nuclear energy, installed nuclear generating \ncapacity is expected to grow significantly as more international projects are envisaged. However, \nthe exact size of the programme based on technical co -operation with other count ries is yet to \nbe finalised.  \nSupply and procurement strategy  \nUranium requirements for pressurised heavy water reactors are being met with a combination \nof domestic and imported sources.

The West Kalimantan \nuranium deposits (Kalan deposits) were discovered in 1973. The North Sumatra uran ium deposits \n(Sibolga deposits) were discovered in 1980. And the West Sulawesi uranium deposits (Mamuju \ndeposits) were discovered in 2013. From 1981 to 1991, pilot -scale mining and processing \nexperiments were carried out at the Kalan deposit with a plant c apacity of two tonnes of ore per \nday. The pilot test of 964 tonnes of ore (1  000 ppm) yielded 740.5  kg of yellowcake (U in yellowcake \n60%) via solvent extraction. Environmental remediation of the plant site is ongoing (2020). The \nKalan metamorphite deposit  type uranium mineralisation consists of uraninite (tourmaline -\nsulphide association) in veins in schistose metapelites, metasiltstones and quartzites derived \nfrom a Cretaceous protolith, with thermal metamorphism associated with the intrusion of \nyounger gr anites. Centimetre to decimetre scale uranium mineralised veins exhibit lithological \ncontrols with mineralisation mobilised along schistosity planes, and tectonic controls where mineralisation on schistosity planes has been remobilised into open, cross- cutting younger faults \nand breccias. Mineralised intersections range up to 1.4  m in thickness with a maximum grade of \nup to 0.28% U from the Kalan test mining tunnel. The Mamuju deposits occur in Tertiary alkaline \nvolcanic rocks. The Sibolga deposits occur in  Tertiary sandstones with uranium enrichments \nassociated with black shales.  \nUranium exploration by the Centre for Development of Nuclear Ore and Geology of the \nNational Nuclear Energy Agency of Indonesia (BATAN) started in the 1960s. Up to 1996, \nreconnaiss ance surveys had covered 79% of a total of 533  000 km\n2 identified for surveying based \non favourable geological criteria and promising exploration results. Since that year, the \nexploration activities have been focused on the Kalan, Kalimantan, in which the most significant \nindications of uranium mineralisation have been found. During 1998 -1999, exploration consisted \nof systematic geological and radiometric mapping, including a radon survey carried out at Tanah \nMerah and Mentawa, Kalimantan to delineate the m ineralised zone. The results of those activities \nincreased speculative resource estimates by 4  090 tU to 12  481 tU. From 2000 up to 2002, \nexploration drilling was carried out at upper Rirang (178  m), Rabau (115  m) and Tanah Merah \n(181 m) in West Kalimantan . \nIn 2003 -2004, additional exploration drilling was conducted at Jumbang  1 (186 m) and \nJumbang  2 (227  m). In 2005, exploration drilling was carried out at Jumbang  3 (45 m) and at \nMentawa (45  m), in 2006 at Semut (454 m) and Mentawa (45  m) and in 2007 at Se mut (174  m). In \n2008, no exploration drilling was undertaken.  \nIn 2009, exploration drilling was continued in the Kalan A rea and detailed, systematic \nprospection in the Kawat area and its surroundings was also carried out. General prospection \nin Bangka Beli tung Province was also undertaken. Plans were adopted to extend exploration in \nKalimantan and Sumatra by prospecting from general reconnaissance to systematic stages to \ndiscover new uranium deposits. In 2010, efforts were devoted to evaluating drilling dat a from \nthe Kawat sector to re -evaluate estimates of speculative resources.  \nUranium and thorium exploration in 2015 continued in the Mamuju area, West Sulawesi \nProvince (alkaline volcanic -hosted mineralisation), and in the Ella Ilir area, West Kalimantan \nProvince. In the Mamuju area, detailed ground radiometric mapping was conducted in the \nTakandeang, Taan, Ahu, Pangasaan and Hulu Mamuju sectors. Geophysical resistivity and \ninduced polarisation  surveys conducted in the Botteng and Takandeang sectors were fol lowed \nNATIONAL REPORTS: INDONESIA  \n304 URA NIUM 202 2: RESOURCES, PRODUCTION AND DEMAND, NEA No. 7634, © OECD 202 3 by reconnaissance drilling for a total depth of 1  600 m, which was comprised of 570  m in the \nBotteng sector, 830  m in the Takandeang sector, and 200  m in the Taan sector. Drilling targets \nwere anomalous uranium occurring as stratabound and supergene enrichment in volcanic \ndeposits. Exploration in the Ella Ilir area included geological and radiometric mapping and \nreconnaissance drilling with 400  m of total depth. The drilling in this area focused on uranium \nveins in metapelite schistose and metatuff.  \nRecent and ongoing uranium exploration and mine development activities  \nIn 2019, exploration was conducted in the Mamuju (West Sulawesi), Harau (West Sumatra), and \nMelawi (West Kalimantan) regions. Exploration in the Mamuju region was completed over the \nAmp alas, Takandeang, and Ahu sectors that are host to uranium and thorium anomalies. In the \nAmpalas area, geological and radiometric mapping was conducted in the upper part of Ampalas \nRiver, leading to the discovery of secondary uranium minerals in stratified  volcanic rocks. In the \nTakandeang -Ahu area, six holes (425  m) were drilled to test for mineralisation in alkaline lava \nflows. In the eastern part of the Takandeang area, detailed geological mapping of lateritic soil was completed to understand uranium and  thorium deposit characteristics and distribution. \nGeophysical investigation using resistivity methods identified soil thickness and bedrock morphology. Exploration in the Harau region focused on the re -evaluation of the previous \ndiscovery of anomalous rad iometric values in the area. Based on the survey, thorium is contained \nin metamorphic rocks with very low contents of uranium. In Melawi region reconnaissance, geological, geochemical and radiometric mapping, as well as radon gas measurement focused on \nevaluating the potential for the occurrence of uranium deposits in a sedimentary basin setting.  \nIn 2020, exploration was conducted in the Mamujui, Bangka Island and Melawi regions. In \nMamuju, radon gas surveys were conducted over the 2019 Takandeang -Ahu dril ling area to \ndelineate the distribution of uranium. The geochemistry of drill core (by portable XRF) and \nassociated spectrometric logging was also completed. In the Melawi basin, exploration included \npreliminary grid -based radon gas surveys leading to the identification of several radon anomalies \nthat warrant further drill testing. Exploration in the Bangka Island area included detailed \nradiometric and radon gas surveys and spectral logging measurements in 13 holes (20 -70 m depth) \nthat tested a placer depos it.  \nNo mining activity is currently under consideration.  \nUranium resources  \nIdentified conventional resources (reasonably assured and inferred resources)  \nIn situ measured and indicated resources amount to 7 391  tU (<USD 130/KgU), and t he total in \nsitu infe rred resources are 4 065 tU (<USD 130/KgU). Inferred resources include those from the \nfollowing localities: Mamuju (2 998 tU); Tann (431 tU); Takandeang including Salumati (165 tU) \nand Rantedunia (56 tU); Aloban including Sibolga (415 tU).  \nThe Kalan Area c onsists of 16 sectors exhibiting uranium potential: Remaja, Lembah Hitam, \nLemajung, Semut, Rirang, Rabau Hulu, Sarana, Tanah Merah, Amir Engkala, Jeronang, Jumbang, Ketungau, Parembang Kanan, Ririt, Dendang Arai, Bubu and Kayu Ara. Until 2018, Indonesia ha d \nreported 2 029 tU as a measured resource from the Remaja and Lembah Hitam Sector to the Red Book. A recent (2020) geostatistical evaluation of the Rabau Hulu sector completed by BATAN provided an estimate of 408 480 tonnes of ore with a grade of 0.0677% or 677  ppm uranium, for \na total of 268 tU, including 214 tU categorised as a measured resource and 54 tU categorised as \nan indicated resource.  \n  \nNATIONAL REPORTS: INDONESIA  \nURANIUM 202 2: RESOURCES, PRODUCTION AND DEMAND, NEA No. 7634, ©  OECD 20 23 305 Undiscovered conventional resources (prognosticated and speculative resources)  \nTotal undiscovered prognosticate d and speculative resources amount to 37  292 tU. The \nundiscovered resources as prognosticated resources from the Kalan, Kawat, Mentawa and \nMamuju areas are 30  179 tU. Additions to the speculative resources for the Mamuju area include \nthe Hulu Mamuju Sector  in 2019 (1 096 tU) and Ampalas Sector in 2020 (6 017 tU). The Hulu \nMamuju resources were calculated using the United States Energy Research and Developments \nAdministration method, while the Ampalas resources used the Three -Part Quantitative \nAssessment met hod.  \nUnconventional resources and other materials  \nThe uranium resource potential in the Bangka and Belitung areas comprises placer deposits of monazite within a tin deposit. Monazite, a uranium/thorium phosphate mineral, was deposited \nin the alluvium and has mostly accumulated as a tailings by -product material of tin mining. The \ntotal resources from deposits in Bangka and Belitung islands total 25 236 tU. In Singkep, the \nuranium potential is in lateritic soil, with a resource of 1  100 tU.

Between 1977 and the end of 1978, airborne geophysical surveys \ncovered one -third of Iran (650 000 km²). Many surficial radiation anomalies were identified, and \nfollow -up field surveys have continue d to the present. The airborne coverage has been mainly \nover the central, south -eastern, eastern and north -western parts of Iran. The favourable regions \nstudied by this procedure are the Bafq- Robateh Posht e Badam region (Saghand, Narigan, \nKhoshumi), Maksa n and Hudian in south- eastern Iran and Dechan, Mianeh and Guvarchin in \nAzarbaijan. Outside of the airborne geophysical coverage area, uranium mineralisations at \nTalmesi, Meskani, Kelardasht and the salt plugs of south Iran are also worthy of mention.  \nMine development  \nAt the Saghand uranium mine (1 and 2), feasibility studies and basic engineering designs  \n(1994- 1995) and mining preparation reports (1996) led to the construction of administration and \nindustrial buildings and procurement of equipment (1997 -1998). Shafts No. 1 and No. 2 were sunk \nfrom 1999 to 2002 and the underground development of the Saghand mine began in 2003.  \nThe Khoshumi area is composed of 47 anomalies that are mainly related to metamorphite -\ntype uranium deposits. Orefield No. 6 of this area was considered for feasibility studies. Five anomalies in Narigan turned out to be ore fields of hydrothermal and metasomatite -type uranium \ndeposits. Mineral deposit No. 3 in the Narigan area was a candidate for feasibility studies.  \nRecent and ongoing  uranium exploration and mine development activities  \nUranium exploration activities  \nFollowing the development of a comprehensive plan, exploration activities are being performed \nwithin favourable areas from reconnaissance to detailed phases. The reconnaissance and \nprospecting phases are being undertaken in the central, southern, eastern, south -eastern and \nnorth -western provinces of the country, and uranium mineralisation with positive indications has \nbeen found in various geological environments. Uranium ex ploration (prospecting and general \nexploration) is being conducted in different parts of the country for different types of deposits, such as granite -related, metasomatite, volcanogenic, intrusive and sedimentary types.  \n                                                      \n*  Secretariat Report based on Red Book 2020 and 8 March 2021 correspondence from Iranian authorities \nupdating production figures published in Red Book 2020.  \nNATIONAL REPORTS: IRAN (ISLAMIC REPUBLIC OF)  \n308 URA NIUM 202 2: RESOURCES, PRODUCTION AND DEMAND, NEA No. 7634, © OECD 202 3 Mine development activities  \nMines N o. 1 and 2 in the Saghand mining and industrial complex are being developed.

uranium exploration has been carried out by the Power Reactor and Nuclear Fuel \nDevelopment Corporation (P NC) and its predecessor since 1956. About 6 600 tU of uranium \nresources were discovered in Japan before domestic uranium exploration activities were \nterminated in 1988. Overseas uranium exploration began in 1966 with activities carried out \nmainly in Austra lia and Canada, as well as other countries such as Niger, the People’s Republic \nof China, the United States and Zimbabwe.  \nIn October 1998, the PNC was reorganised into the Japan Nuclear Cycle Development \nInstitute (JNC). The Atomic Energy Commission decide d in February 1998 to terminate uranium \nexploration activities in 2000 and the JNC’s mining interests and technologies were transferred \nto the private sector. In October 2005, the Japan Atomic Energy Agency (JAEA) was established \nby integrating the Japan A tomic Energy Research Institute and the JNC.  \nIn April 2007, the Japanese government decided to resume overseas uranium exploration \nactivities with financial support from Japanese companies through the Japan Oil, Gas and Metals \nNational Corporation (JOGMEC). JOGMEC is carrying out exploration activities in Australia, \nCanada, Namibia, Uzbekistan and other countries.  \nRecent and ongoing uranium exploration and mine development activities  \nJapan -Canada Uranium Co. Ltd (JCU), which took over the JNC’s Canadian min ing interests, is \ncontinuing exploration activities in Canada while JOGMEC continues exploration activities in Uzbekistan and Namibia. Japanese private companies hold shares in companies developing uranium mines and also in those operating mines in Austral ia, Canada, Kazakhstan and Niger.  \nUranium resources  \nIdentified conventional resources (reasonably assured and inferred resources)  \nAbout 6 600 tU of reasonably assured resources (recoverable) at <USD 130/kgU have been identified in Japan.  \nUranium production  \nHistorical review  \nThe PNC established a test pilot plant with a capacity of 50 t ore/day at the Ningyo -toge mine in \n1969. Its operation ended in 1982 with total production amounting to 84 tU. In 1978, a leaching \ntest consisting of three 500 t ore vats with a maximum capacity of 12 000 t ore/year was initiated to process Ningyo -toge ore on a small scale. The vat leaching test was terminated at the end of \n1987.  \nNATIONAL REPORTS: JAPAN  \n316 URA NIUM 202 2: RESOURCES, PRODUCTION AND DEMAND, NEA No. 7634, © OECD 202 3 Secondary sources of uranium  \nProduction of mixed oxide fuels  \nProduction facilities  \nThe JAEA plutonium fuel plant consists of three facilities, the Plutonium Fuel Development \nFacility (PFDF), the Plutonium Fuel Fabrication Facility (PFFF), and the Plutonium Fuel Production Facility (PFPF).  \nThe PFDF, constructed for basic research and the fabrication o f test fuels, started operating \nin 1966. As of 1 January 2021, approximately 2 tonnes of MOX fuel had been fabricated in the PFDF.  The PFFF had two MOX fuel fabrication lines, one for the experimental fast breeder reactor \nJōyō (FBR line) with a capability of 1 tonne MOX/yr and the second for the prototype advanced \nthermal reactor Fugen (ATR line) with 10 tonnes MOX/yr fabrication capability. The FBR line \nstarted operations in 1973, producing the initial fuel load for the experimental J ōyō sodium -\ncooled fast  reactor. FBR line fuel fabrication ended in 1988 and J ōyō fuel fabrication was switched \nto the PFPF. The ATR line started operations in 1972 with MOX fuel fabrication for the Deuterium \nCritical Assembly in JAEA’s O -arai Research and Development Center. Fu el fabrication for ATR \nFugen was started in 1975 and ended in 2001. MOX fuel fabrication in both lines amounted to a \ntotal of approximately 155  tonnes.  \nThe PFPF FBR line, constructed to supply MOX fuels for the prototype Monju FBR and the \nexperimental J ōyō FR, has a production capability of 5 tonnes MOX/yr. The PFPF FBR line began \noperating in 1988 fabricating J ōyō fuel reloads. Fuel fabrication for the FBR Monju was started in \n1989. As of 1 January 2021, approximately 16 tonnes of MOX fuels had been fabri cated in the \nPFPF.  \nUse of mixed oxide fuels  \nMonju prototype fast breeder reactor  \nMonju achieved initial criticality in April 1994 and began supplying electricity to the grid in August \n1995. However, during a 40% power operation test of the plant, a sodium leak accident in the \nsecondary heat transport system in December 1995 interrupted operation. After carrying out an \ninvestigation to determine the cause, a two -year comprehensive safety review, and the required \nlicensing procedure, the permit for plant modification (including countermeasures to reduce the likelihood of sodium leak accidents) was issued in December 2002 by the Ministry of Energy, Trade \nand Industry. The JAEA completed a series of countermeasure modifications in May 2007, \nimplemented a modifie d system function test until August 2007, and then conducted an entire \nsystem function test. The existing 78 slightly used and 6 newly fabricated fuel assemblies were \nloaded by 27 July 2009. Following the system start -up test, Monju was restarted on 6 May 2010. \nThe core confirmation test was completed on 22 July 2010 and 33 freshly fabricated fuel assemblies \nwere loaded by 18 August 2010. However, after refuelling, the in -vessel fuel transfer machine was \ndropped on 26 August 2010 and removed by 24 June 2011.  \nThe government formally decided on 21 December 2016 to decommission the Monju FBR in \nFukui Prefecture. It plans to remove the spent nuclear fuel by 2022 and finish dismantling the facility by 2047.  \nExperimental fast reactor J ōyō \nThe experimental fast reactor J ōyō attained criticality in April 1977 with the MK -I breeder core. \nAs an irradiation test bed, the J ōyō MK-II core achieved maximum design output of 100 MW in \nMarch 1983. Thirty -five duty cycle operations and thirteen spe cial tests with the MK -II core had \nbeen completed by June 2000. The MK -III high -performance irradiation core, with design output \nincreased to 140 MW, achieved initial criticality in July 2003. Six duty cycle operations and four \nspecial tests with MK -III co re were completed. The J ōyō net o peration time reached around \n70 000 hours and 588 fuel subassemblies were irradiated during MK -I, MK -II and MK -III core \noperations.  \nNATIONAL R EPORTS: JAPAN  \nURANIUM 202 2: RESOURCES, PRODUCTION AND DEMAND, NEA No. 7634, ©  OECD 20 23 317 The new regulatory requirements for research reactors were launched on 18 December 2013. \nThe JAEA submitted an appl ication to comply with the new regulatory requirements for research \nreactors to J ōyō with MK -IV core (100 MW) on 30 March 2017. A safety review is being conducted.  \nUranium policies, uranium stocks and uranium prices  \nNational policies relating to uranium  \nJapan has relatively scarce domestic uranium resources and therefore relies on overseas uranium \nsupply.

The work included an airborne gamma- spectrometric survey covering the entire \nHashemite Kingdom of Jordan, and ground radiometric surveys over selected sites and exploration \ntrenche s. \nDuring the 1990s, reconnaissance and exploration studies revealed surficial uranium \ndeposits distributed in several areas of the country:  \n• Central Jordan: 1  700 trenches and over 2  000 samples from exploration were analysed for \nuranium using a fluoromet er, which revealed the occurrence of uranium mineralisation as \nminute mineral grains disseminated within fine calcareous Pleistocene sediments and as \nyellowish films of carnotite and other uranium minerals coating fractures of fragmented \nchalk or marl of M astrichtian -Paleocene age. Results of channel sampling in three areas \nindicated uranium contents ranging from 120 to 1 870 ppm U (0.012% to 0.187% U) over an average thickness of about 1.3 m, with overburden of about 0.5 m.  \n• The airborne gamma -spectrometric survey identified several other areas with radiation \nanomalies (Mafraq, Ruwayshid, Russeifa, Hasa- Qatrana, Dana, Wadi Al -Bahiyyah, \nDubaydib, Al Awja, and WadiSahabAlabyad) and potential for hosting uranium \nmineralisation. However, only three areas were co vered by follow -up reconnaissance \nstudies (Mafraq, Wadi Al- Bahiyyah and WadiSahabAlabyad).  \nIn 2008, the Jordan Atomic Energy Commission (JAEC) was established, in accordance with \nthe Nuclear Energy Law (Law No. 42) of 2007 and amendments in 2008. The JAEC is the official \nentity entrusted with the development and implementation of the Jordanian nuclear power \nprogramme. The exploration, extraction, and mining of all nuclear materials, including uranium, \nthorium, zirconium, and vanadium, are under the authorit y of the JAEC.  \nThe Nuclear Fuel Cycle Commission of JAEC is in charge of developing and managing all \naspects of the nuclear fuel cycle, including uranium exploration, extraction, production, securing fuel supply and services, nuclear fuel management and r adioactive waste management. The JAEC \nuranium policy is to maximise sovereignty while creating value from resources and to avoid concessions to foreign companies. To attract investors and operate on a commercial basis, the \nJAEC created Jordan Energy Resour ces Inc. as its commercial arm .  \nIn September 2008, the JAEC signed an exploration agreement with Areva S.A. (now Orano \nS.A.) and created the Jordanian French Uranium Mining Company (JFUMC), a joint venture \ncreated to carry out all exploration activities a nd which led to a feasibility study on developing \nresources in the Central Jordan Area. In January 2009, the JAEC signed a memorandum of understanding entitling Rio Tinto to carry out reconnaissance and prospecting in three areas \n(north of Al -Bahiyyah, Wad i SahbAlabiadh and Rewashid). Exploration activities by Jordanian \nteams in co -operation with the China Nuclear International Uranium Corporation were carried \nout in two other areas (Mafraq and Wadi Al -Bahiyyah).  \nDuring 2009- 2012, the JFUMC explored the no rthern part of the central Jordan licence area, \nwhich included geological mapping, a radiometric survey, trenching, sampling, chemical analyses, \ndevelopment of an environmental impact assessment and a hydrogeological study, building a \ndatabase inventory, and drilling a total of 5  691 boreholes that were surveyed for gamma radiation \nNATIONAL REPORTS: JORDAN  \nURANIUM 202 2: RESOURCES, PRODUCTION AND DEMAND, NEA No. 7634, ©  OECD 20 23 321 at 0.10 m intervals.

Jordan \nterminated the mining agreement with the JFUMC at the end of 2012.  \nIn 2013, the JAEC established the Jordan Uranium Mining Company (JUMCO) as a commercial \narm to complete the exploration and resource estimation of the Central Jordan Uranium Deposits.  \nRecent and ongoing uranium exploration and mine development activities  \nDuring 2013 -2018, JUMCO completed several exploration activities, including  trenching, channel \nsampling (QA/QC) and chemical analyses. In June 2018, the third JORC compliant report was \nissued.  \nThe estimated resources for the Central Jordan Uranium Project (CJUP) deposit are reported \nin compliance with JORC (2012) as mineral resou rces at an 80 ppm U (0.008%  U) cut -off grade, \nand include measured, indicated and inferred categories. In total, the CJUP deposit contains approximately 303  Mt of uranium mineral ore at an average grade of 116 ppm U\n3O8 (0.01% U), as \nof February 2018.  \nPlans  for 2019 -2020 included a drilling programme on a 50 x 50 m grid in selected areas to \nupgrade the resource category of the deep mineralised layer to measured resources leading to \npre-feasibility studies. During the second half of 2019, JUMCO completed the development of \nthe required wireline logging capacity required to execute the planned drilling campaign. But \nupon final preparation during the first quarter of 2020, the COVID -19 pandemic stopped all \nexploration activities and caused the plan to be put on hold.  \nUranium resources  \nIdentified conventional resources (reasonably assured and inferred resources)  \nCentral Jordan Area  \nJORC compliant resource estimations include 33  300 tU as inferred resources and 8  000 tU as \nreasonably assured resources (in situ).  \nHasa -Qatrana Area  \nIn 2012, a preliminary resource estimation was carried out in this area, covering seven mineralised zones with total in situ inferred resources of about 28 700 tU.  \nUndiscovered conventional resources (prognosticated and speculative reso urces)  \nNo change (about 50 000 tU as speculative resources in carbonate rock deposits in Mafraq and Wadi Al- Bahiyyah areas and sandstone deposits in Dubaydib Area).  \nUnconventional resources and other materials  \nNo change (about 100 000 tU in the phosphat e deposits).  \nUranium production  \nHistorical review  \nJordan does not currently produce uranium. In 1982, a feasibility study for uranium extraction from phosphoric acid was completed by an engineering company (Lurgi A.G. of Frankfurt, Germany) on behalf of the Jordan Fertiliser Industry Company, and the company was \nNATIONAL REPORTS: JORDAN  \n322 URA NIUM 202 2: RESOURCES, PRODUCTION AND DEMAND, NEA No. 7634, © OECD 202 3 subsequently purchased by the Jordan Phosphate Mines Company. One of the extraction \nprocesses evaluated was originally found to be economically feasible, but as uranium prices \ndropped in the 1990s , the process became uneconomic and construction of an extraction plant \nwas deferred.  \nIn 2009, SNC -Lavalin performed a technological and economic feasibility study for the \nrecovery of uranium from the phosphoric acid produced at the Aqaba Fertilizer Complex. This \nstudy was performed jointly with Prayon Technologies S.A. The profitability was evaluated to \nbe 6.8% for the internal rate of return.  \nJUMCO is currently conducting research to develop optimised extraction parameters, \nincluding:  \n• Research on dynam ic alkaline leaching of central Jordan ore, which has provided \npromising results of more than 90% recovery.  \n• The evaluation of process parameters and recovery of uranium at a laboratory scale, \nusing 1 -2 m high, 0.14 m diameter extraction columns. The resul ts were promising with \nmore than 80% recovery.  \n• The evaluation of the scale -up parameters and extraction process at a small -scale pilot -\nplant, using extraction columns, 6 m high and 0.5 m in diameter, for a large -scale heap \nleach. Recovery was in line with previous laboratory studies.  \n• Installation and commissioning of a pilot -scale uranium e xtraction plant (three cribs, \n3 x 3 x 6 m) with a capacity of approximately 180 tonnes of ore that was commissioned \nfor uranium extraction in 2021. The purpose of such a pilot -scale plant is to fine -tune the \ndeveloped process for extracting uranium from the local ores of Central Jordan and to \ngenerate the technical data needed for finalising the detailed engineering of the commercial plant as well as feeding the bankable f easibility study.  \n• Mutual collaboration between Jordan and the International Atomic Energy Agency has enabled JUMCO to establish an on -site analytical laboratory to support the exploration \nand extraction activities; the laboratory was commissioned in 2020.  \n• Planning to build one cell heap leaching pad. This includes finalising engineering drawings, manufacturing units needed, supporting infrastructure, etc.  \nStatus of production capability  \nJordan does not have firm plans to produce uranium. Nevertheless, JUMC O is investigating the \nperspectives of uranium production in the country and will prepare a bankable feasibility study as soon as other related studies are finished.  \nUranium requirements  \nIn 2010, Jordan announced plans to develop civil nuclear power, stat ing its intention to have four \nunits in operation by 2040. Nuclear co -operation agreements have been signed with a number of \ncountries, including Canada, China, France, Japan, Korea, Russia and the United Kingdom. In 2011, it was reported that Jordan would  be receiving bids from nuclear power plant vendors. Currently, \nthe kingdom imports over 95% of its energy needs, and disruptions in natural gas supply from \nEgypt have reportedly cost Jordanians more than USD  1 million a day.  \nDespite the need to generate electricity by other means, the accident at the Fukushima Daiichi \nnuclear power plant created some local resistance to the plan to have one 700 -1 200 MWe reactor \noperating by 2020 and a second unit of similar size by 2025. This has created some issues rela ted \nto site selection for the planned reactor construction.  \n  \nNATIONAL REPORTS: JORDAN  \nURANIUM 202 2: RESOURCES, PRODUCTION AND DEMAND, NEA No. 7634, ©  OECD 20 23 323 Applying exclusion and discretionary criteria, a country -wide survey was carried out and a \nproposed site (2.5 km2) was selected for the construction of the nuclear power plant. Currently, \ndetai led studies are being carried out to evaluate and characterise the selected site, as well as \nother studies related to the construction and operation of the nuclear power plant.  \nNational policies related to uranium  \nWith Jordan’s intention to develop a pea ceful atomic energy programme to generate electricity \nand water desalination, the JAEC restarted uranium exploration in the country with the goal of \nachieving some energy self -sufficiency.  \nUranium exploration and development expenditures and drilling effort – domestic  \n(JOD [Jordanian dinars])  \n  2018 2019 2020 2021 (expected)  \nGovernment exploration expenditures  3 420 000  2 500 000  1 730 000  2 000 000  \nTotal expenditures  3 420 000  2 500 000  1 730 000  2 000 000  \nGovernment exploration trenches (m)  6 944  0 0 0 \nGovernment trenches  1 736  0 0 0 \nReasonably assured conventional resources by production method  \n(in situ tonnes U)  \nProduction method  <USD 40/kgU  <USD 80/kgU  <USD 130/kgU  <USD 260/kgU  Recovery factor (%)  \nOpen -pit mining (OP)  0 0 8 000  8 000  NA \nTotal  0 0 8 000  8 000   \nReasonably assured conventional resources by processing method  \n(in situ tonnes U)  \nProcessing method  <USD 40/kgU  <USD 80/kgU  <USD 130/kgU  <USD 260/kgU  Recovery factor (%)  \nHeap leaching* from OP  0 0 8 000  8 000  NA \nTotal  0 0 8 000  8 000   \n* A subset of open -pit and underground mining, since it is used in conjunction with them.  \nReasonably assured conventional resources by deposit type  \n(in situ tonnes U)  \nDeposit type  <USD 40/kgU  <USD 80/kgU  <USD 130/kgU  <USD 260/kgU  \nSurficial  0 0 8 000  8 000  \nTotal  0 0 8 000  8 000  \n  \nNATIONAL REPORTS: JORDAN  \n324 URA NIUM 202 2: RESOURCES, PRODUCTION AND DEMAND, NEA No. 7634, © OECD 202 3 Inferred conventional resources by production method  \n(in situ tonnes U)  \nProduction method  <USD 40/kgU  <USD 80/kgU  <USD 130/kgU  <USD 260/kgU  Recovery factor (%)  \nOpen -pit mining (OP)  0 0 62 000  62 000  NA \nTotal  0 0 62 000  62 000   \nInferred conventional resources by processing method  \n(in situ tonnes U)  \nProcessing method  <USD 40/kgU  <USD 80/kgU  <USD 130/kgU  <USD 260/kgU  Recovery factor (%)  \nHeap leaching* from OP  0 0 33 300  33 300  NA \nUnspecified  0 0 28 700  28 700  NA \nTotal  0 0 62 000  62 000   \n* A subset of open -pit and underground mining, since it is used in conjunction with them.  \nInferred conventional resources by deposit type  \n(in situ tonnes U)  \nDeposit type  <USD 40/kgU  <USD 80/kgU  <USD 130/kgU  <USD 260/kgU  \nSurficial  0 0 62 000  62 000  \nTotal  0 0 62 000  62 000  \nSpeculative conventional resources  \n(in situ tonnes U)  \nCost ranges  \n<USD 130/kgU  <USD 260/kgU  Unassigned  \n0 50 000  NA \n \nNATIONAL REPORTS: KAZAKHSTAN  \nURANIUM 202 2: RESOURCES, PRODUCTION AND DEMAND, NEA No. 7634, ©  OECD 20 23 325 Kazakhstan  \nUranium exploration  \nHistorical review  \nSince uranium exploration began  in Kazakhstan in 1944, about 60  uranium deposits have been \nidentified in six uranium ore provinces – Shu-Sarysu, Syrdarya, Northern Kazakhstan, Caspian, \nBalkhash and Ili.  \nBy the late  1970s , unique deposits suitable for uranium mining by in situ leaching (ISL), such \nas Inkai, Mynkuduk, Moinkum, Kanzhugan and North and South Karamurun, were discovered.  \nRecent and ongoing uranium exploration and mine development activities  \nDuring 201 9 and 2020, exploration was undertaken at Inkai, Budenovskoye in the Shu -Sary su \nUranium Province and at the Northern Kharasan and Zarechnoye deposits in the Syrdaria \nUranium Province.  \nJV Katco LLP continued pilot production in the southern part of site No. 2 (Tortkuduk) of the \nMoinkum deposit. In 2017 exploration was completed and a technical report on resource estimates was approved.  \nInkai JV LLP returned sites No. 2 and 3 to the state in 2017 and in 201 9-2020 continued further \nexploration of site No. 1 of the Inkai field.  \nThe JV Khorasan -U LLP and the Baiken -U LLP completed explor ation at the Northern \nKharasan field.  \nIn 2021, the Zarechnoye JSC completed additional exploration and re -evaluation of \nresources at the Zarechnoye deposit.  \nExploration at the Zhalpak field with pilot production began in 2017 and the work was \ncompleted in  2020.  \nAs a result of exploration in 2019 -2020, an increase in C2 (inferred) resources by 55 409 tonnes \nof uranium was obtained at sites No. 6 and No. 7 of the Budenovskoye field.  \nIn 2020 Volkovgeology JSC completed a state geological study contracted by NAC \nKazatomprom JSC. The study focused on the potential for new “ sandstone ” type deposit \ndiscoveries (suitable for mining by in situ leaching) in the perspective areas of the Shu -Sarysu \nuranium province.  \nNo uranium exploration and development was performed by Kazakh enterprises outside of \nKazakhstan.  \nUranium resources  \nIdentified conventional resources (reasonably assured and inferred resources)  \nAs of 1  January 2021, identified in situ uranium resources available at a cost < USD  260/kgU \namounted to 990 954 tU, including 822 334 tU of resources amenable for ISL recovery. Total \nrecoverable resources, with mining and processing losses taken into consideration, amounted to 874 704 tU, including 731 877 tU amenable for ISL mining.  \nNATIONAL REPORTS: KAZAKHSTAN  \n326 URA NIUM 202 2: RESOURCES, PRODUCTION AND DEMAND, NEA No. 7634, © OECD 202 3 Total identified in situ resources  decreased by 111 725 tU compared to the previous report \nas a result mainly of mining depletion by 45  508 tU (including production and mining losses) \nduring 2019 -2020, as well as the transfer of 121 630 tU of the Kosachinoye field resources (open \npit and u nderground) to the sub economic  category.

As of 1  January 2021, the total capacity of uranium production centres in Kazakhstan \nwas 27  000 tU/yr. Uranium was mined at the Kanzhugan, Moinkum, Akdala, Uvanas, Mynkuduk, \nInkai, Budenovskoye, North and South Karamurun, Irkol, Zarechnoye, Semizbay and Northern \nKharasan deposi ts. All uranium was mined by ISL method.  \nAll ISL mines in Kazakhstan use sulphuric acid to recover uranium in pregnant solutions. \nFurther processing of pregnant solutions includes sorption on ion -exchange resins followed by \nelution technologies and uranyl salts precipitation from eluates, with further extraction of refined U\n3O8 concentrates. Five mining enterprises (the Appak LLP, Karatau LLP, JV South Mining \nChemical Company LLP, Inkai LLP, and Baiken -U LLP) produce uranium concentrates through \nthe precipi tation of uranium using hydrogen peroxide and further calcination without an \nextraction stage.  \nShu-Sarysu uranium province  \nDevelopment of the Uvanas, Eastern Mynkuduk, Kanzhugan and Moinkum deposits (the southern part of site No. 1 and site No. 3) is carried out by Kazatomprom -Sauran LLP.

Each uranium venture in Kazakhstan has developed a short -term \nwaste management plan, which includes measures to reduce the generation and accumulation \nof wastes. Reliable systems to monitor the environment and radiation safety at uranium mines \nand production sites have been put in place. The purpose of environmental monitoring across \nthe operati ons of the company is to provide reliable information on the environmental impact \nof the enterprise and to implement possible changes in adverse or dangerous situations.  \nEnvironmental safety has a significant role in the effective functioning of the system of \nindustrial environmental monitoring.  \nSocial and/or cultural issues  \nAll contracts for uranium exploration and mining provided by the government require financial \ncontributions to local social and cultural improvements.

Coal is present in the project tenement area in two \ndeposits: the Nkhachira deposit (850  000 tonnes, recoverable by open -pit and underground \nmining) and the Kaye lekera deposit. Uranium is associated with coal at the Kayelekera deposit, \nand due to this association, coal is therefore unavailable for commercial extraction (moreover, \nthis coal is of very low quality).  \nThe Kayelekera deposit was discovered in the early  1980s by the Central Electricity \nGenerating Board of Great Britain (CEGB). Kayelekera is a sandstone -hosted uranium deposit, \nlocated close to the north tip of the North Rukuru Basin. This basin contains a thick (at least \n1 500 m) sequence of Permian Karoo  sandstones preserved in a semi -graben about 35 km to the \nwest of and broadly parallel to the Lake Malawi section of the East African Rift System. \nMineralisation lies within the uppermost 150  m of the Muswanga Member, which is the upper \npart of the Karoo F ormation. The Muswanga Member consists of eight separate arkose units \nwith intervening silty mudstones in an approximate 1:1 ratio. Such a succession is indicative of \ncyclic sedimentation within a broad, shallow, intermittently subsiding basin. The arkose units contain most of the uranium mineralisation. They are on average about 8  m thick, are generally \ncoarse grained and poorly sorted, and contain a high percentage of fresh, pink feldspar grains. The basal arkose units are usually a quartz -feldspar pebble  conglomerate. Coffinite has been \nidentified as the principal uranium -bearing species and it occurs together with minor uraninite. \nNear -surface weathering of primary ore has produced a zone of oxide ore characterised by \nyellow and green secondary uranium m inerals (meta -autunite and boltwoodite). Approximately \n40% of the total ore occurs within reduced arkose, 30% within oxidised arkose, 10% in mixed \narkose, and 20% is considered of the mudstone type.  \nExtensive drilling from 1982 to 1988 defined initial infe rred resources of 9  800 tU at an average \ngrade of 0.13%  U. From 1989 to 1992, geotechnical, metallurgical, hydrological and environmental \nactivities were conducted, as well as a feasibility study, to assess the viability of a conventional \nopen -pit mining operation. This work was completed in 1991 at a total cost of USD  9 million. The \nCEGB study concluded that the project was uneconomic using the mining model adopted and the \nlow uranium prices of that time and so the project was abandoned in 1992.  \nIn 1998, P aladin Resources Ltd (Paladin Energy Ltd as of 1  February 2000) acquired an interest \nin the Kayelekera Project through a joint venture with Balmain Resources Ltd, which at that \ntime held exploration rights over the project area. Engineering and financial e valuation work \nindicated a positive outcome for the project. In 2004, additional drilling was completed to \nimprove confidence in resource estimates, and the pre -feasibility study was updated. Resource \ndrilling and bulk sample drilling for metallurgical tes t work was completed in 2005 and a \nbankable feasibility study was then undertaken. Paladin purchased Balmain’s remaining stake \nin the project in 2005 and became the sole owner.  \n                                                      \n*  Report prepared by the NEA/IAEA, based on previou s Red Books, company reports and input from the \nGovernment of Malawi.  \n \nNATIONAL REPORTS: MALAWI  \n338 URA NIUM 202 2: RESOURCES, PRODUCTION AND DEMAND, NEA No. 7634, © OECD 202 3 Uranium exploration increased as a result of expanding resources at the Kayele kera mine \nand the potential for discovery of additional deposits in a similar geological setting in the Karoo \nGroup sedimentary rocks. Since 2010, Paladin Energy has completed exploration drilling in areas \nto the north -west and south of the mine area with objectives of extending the existing orebody, \nas well as identifying and evaluating new ore bodies, including Mpata to the east and Juma to the south.  \nThe Livingstonia uranium project is a joint venture between two Australian companies, \nResource Star and G lobe Metals and Mining. The geological setting is very similar to that of \nKayelekera. In 2006, Globe drilled 94 holes totalling 11  533 m. In July 2010, Resource Star drilled an \nadditional 1  502 m in 13  holes to prove up a JORC compliant inferred resource of 7.7  million  tonnes \nore grading 0.0229%  U. In 2013, Resource Star, the operator of the Livingstonia Project, reported \nthat thickened zones of mineralisation are open to the north- east, and the sparse drilling in the \nsouthern zone increases potential for a dditional mineralisation being defined. The mineralisation \nis also open to the north, where the project adjoins tenements owned by Paladin Energy Ltd.  \nAnother potential uranium resource is the Kanyika Niobium Project held by Globe Metals. \nUranium is an imp ortant by -product in the complex niobium and tantalum ore in a pegmatite \nquartz vein, hosted in Proterozoic felsic schists. Niobium and tantalum products would be produced with uranium as a by -product. In 2011 -2012, Globe Metals & Mining continued \ndevelopm ent of the Kanyika deposit. Total drilling, reverse circulation and diamond drilling, \namounted to 40  540 m. As of December 2012, total resources amount to 68.3  Mt of ore at average \ngrade of 0.28%  Nb\n2O5, 0.0135%  Ta2O5 and 0.0067%  U (4 550 tU). Globe Metals & Mining submitted \nan environmental impact assessment for the Kanyika Niobium Project for public review in May 2012.  \nRecent and ongoing uranium exploration and mine development activities  \nThe anticipated early approval by the Department of Mines of applications for five exclusive \nprospecting licences (EPLs), covering areas north, south and east of the Kayelekera mine, which \nwould have enabled exploration activity to commence in July 2015, did not occur. The government of Malawi imposed a moratorium on applications and grants of all mining and \nexploration tenements until it introduces a new cadastral system and a new minerals act. As a \nresult, Paladin suspended exploration activities in Malawi until there is clarity on the provisions of the new mining code an d its EPL applications have been granted.  \nIn 2013, Global Metals & Mining approved a demonstration plant to further optimise process \ndesign and reduce project risk in the Kanyika Niobium Project. The focus of the pilot plant is to \nvalidate bench ‐scale tes ting results obtained during the optimisation phase of the Kanyika \nDefinitive Feasibility Study, and also to validate engineering data for plant design. The Kanyika \nbulk sample is located at the Guangzhou Research Institute of Non -Ferrous Metallurgy (China ) \nand the pilot plant is in progress. The mineral concentrate produced from this pilot plant exercise will be used for further downstream metallurgical testing and production of marketing samples.  \nIn February 2018, Globe started a feasibility study aimed at updating and finalising the \ntechnical components of the engineering programme in order to support project funding \ninitiatives. On 11 July 2018, Globe published an updated Mineral Resource Estimate for the \nKanyika Niobium Project, calculated in accordanc e with 2012 JORC guidelines. The resources are \nunchanged from the previous Mineral Resource Estimate published on 7 January 2011.  \nIn January 2019, Globe Metals announced that it had finalised the feasibility study, including \nrevision of the mineral resourc e estimates, mining, metallurgical studies, processing, engineering \ndesign and infrastructural support. It obtained updated capital and operating cost estimates and \nupdated its financial model. However, Globe Metals is not yet in a position to finalise the  financial \nmodel and the key outcomes of the project, due to the current uncertainty associated with the status of the mining law in Malawi, and to the status of negotiations between Globe Metals and the Government on the Development Agreement.  \n  \nNATIONAL REPORTS: MALAWI  \nURANIUM 202 2: RESOURCES, PRODUCTION AND DEMAND, NEA No. 7634, ©  OECD 20 23 339 In March 2020, the Australian company Lotus Resources Ltd completed the acquisition of the \nKayelekera Project from Paladin Energy and announced an increase in JORC compliant resources \nto 1 580 tU of measured resources, including run of mine stockpile, 10 445 tU of indicated resources, \nand 2 428 tU of inferred resources, including a low -grade stockpile. The average grade is 0.053 %U \nand the figures indicate an assumed 0.026%U cut -off. Resources are reported as in situ.  \nIn June 2021, Lotus Resources Ltd announced the start of a 5 000 m reverse circulation drilling \nprogramme at Kayelekera. Drilling will test airborne radiometric anomalies located within 3 km of the existing processing facility with the objective of increasing the current 14 years of mine life.  \nUranium resources  \nIdentified conventional resources (reasonably assured and inferred resources)  \nAs of 1 January 2021 Malawi’s total recoverable identified resources were 16 272 tU. This is based \non resources at three locations: Paladin’s Kayelekera operating mine ( 11 720 tU), Resource Star’s \nLivingstonia deposit (1  822 tU) (both sandstone deposits), and Globe Metal’s Kanyika niobium \ndeposit (2  730 tU), where uranium will be produced as a by -product. During 2019 and 2020, \nrecoverable uranium resources increased by 1  995 tU, as a result of a new resource evaluation \ncompleted by Lotus Resources Ltd.  \nUranium production  \nHistorical review  \nThe Kayelekera mine is located in the Karonga district of the northern region of Malawi, about 600 km by road from the capital city of L ilongwe. Transport of the first product to Walvis Bay, \nNamibia, via Zambia, took place on 17  August 2009. Uranium production is by open pit with an \nannual production of 1  270 tU planned with a mine life of nine years.  \nUranium is recovered using a solvent e xtraction process, with sulphuric acid as the lixiviant \nand sulphur dioxide/air mixture as the oxidant. The plant utilises a resin -in-pulp (RIP) process \nwhich is a first in the Western world for uranium production. Expected uranium mill recovery is 90%. Pr oduction was hampered in 2009 and 2010 by technical problems with the RIP process. \nIn addition, land slip problems in 2010 resulted in remediation work being implemented and made it necessary to relocate certain parts of the plant and machinery.  \nIn 2013, t he Kayelekera mine made progress on cost reductions, mainly on the acid supply \nfront, where the project became acid independent through a number of measures. Improvements \nincluded increases in on -site acid production and the addition of the nano- filtration  plant, which \nassisted with acid recycle. In addition to acid management, other improvements were realised in \nthe milling, leach and RIP efficiencies, particularly with completion of modifications in the RIP section.  \nIn 2014, the site was placed on care and maintenance. Following a period of reagent run -down, \nprocessing was completed in early May 2014. This was expected to cost about USD  12 million per \nyear, ongoing, compared with operating losses of double of that. It is expected that production will recommence once the uranium price provides a sufficient incentive (circa USD  75/lb U\n3O8; \nUSD 195/kgU) and grid power supply is available on -site to replace the existing diesel generators \nwith low -cost hydroelectricity.  \nIn 2013 and 2014, the Kayelekera mine prod uced 1  132 tU and 369  tU, respectively. Once \nuranium prices offer sufficient incentive to restart, production, with some RIP/elution upgrades, is expected to be up to 1  270 tU per year.  \nNATIONAL REPORTS: MALAWI  \n340 URA NIUM 202 2: RESOURCES, PRODUCTION AND DEMAND, NEA No. 7634, © OECD 202 3 Status of production facilities, production capability, recent and ong oing activities and \nother issues  \nIn 2020, Lotus Resources Ltd conducted a restart scoping study of the Kayelekera uranium mine. \nTwo scenarios were considered:  treating only high -grade material and treating the medium -\ngrade stockpiles at the end of the life of mine after high- grade material is exhausted.  \nThe first scenario involves an 8 -year life of mine, producing 6  300 tU with average head grade \nof about 0.076% U. The second scenario considered a 14 -year life of mine, producing 9  150 tU, \nwith treatment of  stockpiles from year 8 (with an average head grade of about 0.0580%  U). \nUnder the first scenario, production costs would be USD 85.8/kgU during years 2 -6, with \naverage annual production of 920 tU. Lotus Resources noted that multiple opportunities were \nidentified to further reduce these costs, including: upgrading of feed materials; improved options \naround power supply; acid recovery; and optimised tailings disposal options.  \nThe restart of Kayelekera would require an initial capital cost of USD 50 million.  \nOwnership structure of the uranium industry  \nTwo Australian companies, Paladin Energy and Resource Star, used to be active in Malawi in the \nprimary uranium sector.  \nPaladin held an 85% interest in the Kayelekera Project through its subsidiary company Paladin  \n(Africa) Limited. The remaining 15% is held by the Republic of Malawi according to terms of the \nDevelopment Agreement signed in 2007. Paladin had supplemented ongoing mining with \nextensive exploration activities aimed at growing its resource base in Malaw i. However, in June \n2019 Paladin Energy agreed to sell its 85% interest in the mine to Hylea Metals subsidiary Lotus \nResources Ltd (65%) and to Chichewa Resources (20%) for AUD 5 million. Paladin will receive a 3.5% royalty based on revenues derived from f uture production at Kayelekera, capped at AUD  5 million.  \nOn 13 March 2020, Paladin completed the sale of its 85% interest in Paladin (Africa) Ltd to \nLotus Resources (65%) and Lily Resources Pty Ltd (20%). Lotus, formerly Hylea Metals Limited, \nholds 76.5% o f the shares in Lily with Kayelekera Resources Pty Ltd holding 23.5%, giving \nKayelekera Resources Pty Ltd an indirect 20% interest in the Kayelekera Project. The remaining \n15% of shares in Paladin (Africa) Ltd are held by the Malawi government.  \nIn 2010, Re source Star signed a joint venture agreement with Globe Metals and Mining over \ntheir Livingstonia Project, with Resource Star managing work and earning up to 80% equity. In May 2012, Resource Star announced that it would acquire 100% of the Livingstonia Pr oject from \nGlobe. The Malawi authorities approved the transfer of the exploration licence to Resource Star \nin November 2012, at which time Resource Star applied to the Malawi authorities for a two- year \nextension to the term of the Livingstonia tenement. Gl obal Metals is also involved in rare earth \nexploration with significant uranium by -product potential.  \nEmployment in the uranium industry  \nPaladin employed 759  people at the Kayelekera mine in 2012, of which 118 were expatriates and \n68, or 9%, were female. I nformation on recent employment is not available.  \nFuture production centres  \nGlobe Metals & Mining submitted the environmental impact assessment for the Kanyika Niobium \nProject for public review in May 2012. According to Globe, the aim of the project is to produce niobium and tantalum products with potential production of uranium and zircon. Uranium would \nbe produced as a by -product at a nominal rate of 80  t Na\n2U2O7 (ammonium di -uranate) per year \n(60 tU/yr). Mining will involve the extraction of ore from a single open pit at a rate of 1.5 million \ntonnes per annum using conventional open- pit drill and blast, followed by truck shovel load and \nhaul. The final open pits are expected to have dimensions in the order of 250  m in width, 2.2  km \nin length (north- south) and 130  m in depth. The project will produce approximately 52  million \ntonnes of solids to tailings over the mine life (estimated in excess of 20  years).  \nNATIONAL REPORTS: MALAWI  \nURANIUM 202 2: RESOURCES, PRODUCTION AND DEMAND, NEA No. 7634, ©  OECD 20 23 341 As of January 2019, Globe Metals could not set a time frame for when mining and processing \nat Kanyika could start.  \nUranium production centre technical details  \n(as of 1  January 2015)  \n Centre #1  Centre #2  \nName of production centre  Kayelekera  Kanyika  \nProduction centre classification  Idled  Planned  \nDate of first production (year)  2009  NA \nSource of ore:    \nDeposit name(s)  Kayelekera  Kanyika  \nDeposit type(s)  Sandstone  Intrusive  \nRecoverable resources (tU)  9 150  2 730 \nGrade (% U)  0.058  0.008  \nMining operation:    \nType (OP/UG/ISL)  OP OP \nSize (tonnes ore/day)  4 000  6 000  \nAverage mining recovery (%)  75 NA \nProc essing plant:    \nAcid/alkaline  Acid  NA \nType (IX/SX)  SX NA \nAverage process recovery (%)  80 NA \nNominal production capacity (tU/year)  1 270  60 \nPlans for expansion (yes/no)  Yes NA \nOther remarks  Ramp up to 1 460 tU/yr  By-product  \nEnvironmental activities and socio -cultural issues  \nThere are no updates for the current reporting period.  \nUranium requirements  \nMalawi has no plans for nuclear power.  \nUranium policies, uranium stocks and uranium prices  \nNational policies relating to uranium  \nAll mining activities are under the control of the Department of Mines of the Ministry of Natural \nResources with environmental matters falling under the Department of Environmental Affairs \nin the same ministry. However, in common with many developing countries, Malawi has no \nspecif ic legislation or a regulation relating to uranium, but it is working in co -operation with the \nInternational Atomic Energy Agency to develop appropriate legislation. In 2011, the National \nNATIONAL REPORTS: MALAWI  \n342 URA NIUM 202 2: RESOURCES, PRODUCTION AND DEMAND, NEA No. 7634, © OECD 202 3 Assembly passed an atomic energy bill, which is the first step in th e introduction of \ncomprehensive legislation to provide for adequate protection of people as well as the \nenvironment against harmful effects of radiation, nuclear material and radioactive materials.  \nThe government is committed to putting in place policies t hat will attract private sector \nparticipation in the exploration, exploitation, processing and utilisation of Malawi’s mineral \nresources. To this end, in March 2013, the Mines and Mineral Policy of Malawi was developed by \nthe Malawi government. The government recognises that the minerals sector has significant \npotential to contribute towards the rapid economic growth and development of the country. \nThe policy seeks to stimulate and guide private mining investment by administering, regulating \nand facilitatin g the growth of the sector through a well -organised and efficient institutional \nframework. The government will also intensify provision of extension services to the artisanal and small -scale miners and women miners. The goal of the Mines and Minerals Polic y is to \nenhance the contribution of mineral resources to the economy of the country so as to move \nfrom being an agro -based to mineral -based economy.  \nOn 14 December 2018, the National Parliament of Malawi passed a new bill (Mines and \nMinerals Bill 2018) to replace current legislation.

Indicatio ns of uranothorianite and thorianite were discovered in large pegmatite lenses \nenclosed in highly metamorphosed hornblende - and pyroxene -schists of the Suggarian \nsequence. Numerous granites were also studied in the area, but only younger granites showed \nanomalous radioactivity, probably because of the presence of monazite as an accessory mineral.  \nUnder an agreement with the government of Mali, German company Krupp carried out a \nreconnaissance survey in the eastern part of Mali in 1970 with no positive results. In 1971, \nGermany’s Institute for Geosciences and Natural Resources (BGR) carried out a hydrogeochemical \nand radiometric reconnaissance survey in the western Kayes region of the country. Some \nanomalies were found but their character did not encourage fu rther activities. In 1974, Japan’s \nPower Reactor and Nuclear Fuel Development Corporation (PNC) initiated an exploration project \nin the Adrar des Iforas covering parts of the Taoudeni sedimentary basin.  \nIn 1976, the Compagnie Générale des Matières Nucléair es (COGEMA) started exploration in \nthe areas of Kenieba, Kayes, Bamako, Sikasso, Hombori, Douentza and Taoudenni. This work \nincluded airborne radiometric surveys in Kenieba and Taoudenni, and geophysical exploration \n(including drilling) in Kenieba (Faléa a nd Dabora). COGEMA ended its exploration project in 1983 \nand PNC limited its activities to a small area of 20  km\n2. PNC continued work through the first \nquarter of 1985, using radon emanometry and very -low-frequency electromagnetic survey \nmethods over an ar ea of 14  km2, and then ended its activities in the second quarter of 1985.  \nFrom 2007 to 2008, several other companies conducted uranium exploration in Mali. In \n2007 -2008, Australia’s Oklo Uranium Ltd. conducted uranium exploration over the Kidal area, \npart of the underexplored north -eastern part of Mali. Exploration covered the Adrar des Iforas, \nwhich is considered prospective for surficial paleo -channel -hosted uranium, alaskite/pegmatite, \nand vein -hosted uranium, and contains occurrences of uranium, gold,  copper -lead-zinc and \nmanganese. Target identification has been undertaken in the project area with 47% of an airborne geophysical survey completed in 2007. In 2008, potential uranium anomalies were \nlocated and tested with ground spectrometry, geochemical sampling and drilling.  \nAt Faléa, COGEMA first discovered substantial uranium and copper values in the late 1970s, \nbut the project has not advanced because of the prevailing low commodity prices. Exploration \nconducted since 2008 by Rockgate Capital Corp. an d Delta Exploration Inc. focused on defining \nand expanding these initial results.  \nThe mineralisation at the Faléa project occurs within the Neoproterozoic to Carboniferous \nsedimentary sequence of the Taoudeni Basin, a shallow interior sag basin with flat t o very shallow \ndips. Faléa is located along the southern edge of the western province of the Taoudeni Basin. In \nthe previous editions of the Red Book, the Faléa deposit was classified as a sandstone -type deposit. \nNow it is classified as an unconformity -type deposit. With a few exceptions, mineralisation has \nbeen confined to the flat -lying Kania Sandstones unit, as well as within the units immediately \nabove and below it. The distance from the surface to the mineralised horizon varies between \n                                                      \n*  Report prepared by the NEA/IAEA, based on previous Red Books and company reports.  \nNATIONAL REPORTS: MALI  \n346 URA NIUM 202 2: RESOURCES, PRODUCTION AND DEMAND, NEA No. 7634, © OECD 202 3 31.5 m to more t han 350  m below the surface. The first mineralising event related to ore genesis \nis believed to have deposited copper (mostly in the form of chalcopyrite) and silver. The copper \nmineralisation occurs as disseminations, primarily within the Kania Sandstones, around which \nhalos of uranium minerals precipitated (mostly as pitchblende and coffinite), thus acting as a chemical trap (reductant) for uranium mineralisation.  \nFrom January to August 2011, 160 diamond drill holes totalling 45  691 m focused on resource \ndefinition in the North Zone and initial exploration drilling at Bala, south of the Central Zone, East Zone and Road Fault. The programme resumed in October 2011, continuing through July \n2012, and comprised 398 diamond drill holes totalling 88 350 m. Drill ing continued to infill and \nstep-out in the North Zone and expanded north into the Bodi Zone. An additional 44 diamond \ndrill holes were completed in the East Zone and 19  more in the Central Zone as part of an \nexpanded resource definition programme.  \nIn Octo ber and November 2012, a total of 15 936 m were completed in 66 diamond drill holes \nlocated in the Bodi and North Zone areas. Almost all work to date has been completed on the \nFaléa Permit.  \nRecent and ongoing uranium exploration and mine development activi ties \nIn January 2014, Denison Mines Corp. concluded the purchase of Rockgate and commenced \nwork on the Faléa project, including a detailed project review and re interpretation  of existing \nexploration data and comprehensive internal economic study. Results h ave shown the project \nto be uneconomic under current metal prices; however, the potential could improve if additional resources are discovered.  \nA versatile time -domain electromagnetic (VTEM) survey, including magnetic and radiometric \nsurveys, was completed  in March 2015. A small ground follow -up programme was completed in \nJune 2015, including soil sampling and radiometric prospecting.  \nIn June 2016, GoviEx Exploration (Canada) acquired the Faléa project from Denison Mines. \nThe project includes three explorat ion licences, Bala, Faléa and Madini.  \nIn 2017, GoviEx conducted a geophysical survey over the Faléa area. Radon measurements \nwere carried out by Radon Ex. Ltd. New targets have been defined, which have to be developed and are likely to increase the resourc es. No drilling was completed in 2017- 2018.  \nIn 2018, GoviEx applied for new exploration licences for the Bala and Madini areas and \nrenewed the Faléa licence for a second term.  \nAs of 1 January 2019, nine uranium exploration permits had been granted to six e xploration \ncompanies in Mali.

The two exploration permits \ncovered a total area of 164 000 km², divided into four blocks (Chami, Bir Hoghrein, Nouadhibou \nand Ghallamane). In 1975, the total area was reduced to five blocks totalling 41  000 km², and these \njoint ventures were mo dified after the founding of French Minatome SA and Compagnie Générale \ndes Matières Nucléaires.  \nThese joint ventures held the areas up to 1983. Work on the permits was carried out between \n1972 and 1975 and again in 1981 and targeted the evaluation of surf icial-type deposits (Reguibat \nRange), as well as occurrences in the Precambrian basement, where radioactive anomalies were \nfound associated with syenites and granites (Bir En Nar, Tigismat, Tenebdar). In 1983, all uranium \nexploration activities were suspen ded. \nIn December 2007, Australia’s Forte Energy NL completed its first drilling programme in \nMauritania, a 4  006 m reverse circulation programme of 41  holes of 50 -150 m depth. The drilling \nwas carried out in the Bir En Nar area of the Zednes region and fol lowed up on high -grade results \npreviously obtained. Downhole radiometric logging results indicated numerous high -grade \nuranium intersections, including 1.55  m at 18 280 ppm  U (1.83% U).  The results of drilling a \nsecond group of 21 holes yielded up to 6  310 ppm U (0.63% U) over 1  m, and 576  ppm U (0.058%  U) \nover 19  m. \nIn November 2006, the United Kingdom’s Alba Mineral Resources, along with Mauritania \nVentures Limited, started to investigate the uranium potential of areas located in northeast Mauritania. The  area is considered prospective for unconformity -type uranium mineralisation. \nThe permits cover significant areas of an unconformable contact between Early Proterozoic \nreworked granitic terrain and overlying sediments of Late Proterozoic to Carboniferous a ge. \nAirborne geophysics, flown on behalf of the Mauritanian government, revealed radiometric \nanomalies within a mapped, organic -rich unit near the base of this sedimentary sequence, and \ncoincident with its intersection with large, deep penetrating crustal shear structures. Uranium mineralisation is known in the north and northwest part of the permit area, hosted in granites \nand rhyolites cut by these shear structures. On 3  November 2010, Alba Mineral Resources was \nnotified that the mining authorities in Mau ritania had withdrawn the licence, citing a lack of \nadditional exploration activity.  \nMauritania’s Ministry of Petroleum, Energy, and Mines began in 2006 to implement a project, \n“Projet de Renforcement Institutionnel du Secteur Minier (PRISM -II)”, with the US Geological Survey to \ndefine the mineral resource potential of the country. It included delineation of areas permissive for calcrete -hosted, granite -hosted vein/shear, alkaline intrusive -hosted, unconformity -related, \n                                                      \n*  Report prepared by the NEA/IAEA, based on previous Red Books and company reports.  \nNATIONAL REPOR TS: MAURITANIA  \n350 URA NIUM 202 2: RESOURCES, PRODUCTION AND DEMAND, NEA No. 7634, © OECD 202 3 quartz pebble conglomerate- hosted, ph osphate, sandstone -hosted and red bed- type uranium \ndeposits. The results were published in 2013 (USGS Open -File Report 2013 -1280).  \nRecent and ongoing uranium exploration and mine development activities  \nForte Energy NL, based in Australia, holds several ura nium exploration licences in Mauritania, \nincluding for the A 238 and Bir En Ar areas.  \nThe A 238 and Bir En Ar uranium prospects are associated with granites near Bir Moghrein \nin the north of Mauritania. At the A 238 prospect, the main zone of mineralisatio n extends over \na strike length of 1.75 km with mineralisation extending down to over 250  m from the surface \nwith widths of over 60  m within 50  m of the surface.  \nFollowing the positive results of the 2009/10 reverse circulation (RC) drilling, a further RC \ndrilling programme of around 11  300 m commenced in October 2010, focusing initially on anomaly \nA 238. Preliminary results from A 238 indicated the potential for a shallow, large -volume, medium-\ngrade deposit. A total of approximately 10  450 m of RC and diamo nd core drilling has been carried \nout, resulting in an announcement in June 2011 of initial JORC c ode compliant U resources for \nA 238 of 26.5 Mt at 217  ppm U (0.0217% U) for 5 730 tU (85  ppm  U cut -off; 0.0085% U).  \nAfter completing a further 63 holes (8  567 m) of RC drilling in 2011/12, an updated JORC \nresource was announced in April 2012 for A 238.

Between November 2010 and February 2011, Aura completed a drilling \nprogramme which covered all of Aura’s wholly owned permits, as well as its joint venture \npermits, which totalled over 9  100 m in 2  022 holes.  \nA JORC code compliant uranium resource, based on these drilling results, was released in \n2012 (85  ppm U cut -off): \nDeposit  Resource category  Average grade (ppm U)  Tonnes of U  \nReguibat  Indicated  \nInferred  254 (0.0254% U)  \n284 (0.0284% U)  770 \n18 077  \nTotal  Indicated + Inferred  283 (0.0283% U)*  18 847  \n* Weighted -average grade by proportional amount of tU.  \n  \nNATIONAL REPORTS: MAURITANIA  \nURANIUM 202 2: RESOURCES, PRODUCTION AND DEMAND, NEA No. 7634, ©  OECD 20 23 351 In 2014, Aura conducted a scoping study that confirmed that Reguibat could be a robust project \nwith shallow mineralisation that could be upgraded through simple beneficiation to high -grade \nleach feed. The study indicated that some 4  200 tU could be produced over an init ial mine life of \n15 years, using only 20% of the project’s known total mineral resource. The project would require \na capital investment of about USD  50 million and would have an operating cost of USD  30/lbU 3O8 \n(USD 78/kgU), and with a mine -life average pro duction of 290  tU/yr.  \nAdditionally, extensive radiometric surveys allowed Aura to estimate an exploration target of \nan additional 19  000 tU, inferring a total mineral resource target of around 38  000 tU at Reguibat.  \nIn 2015, the project progressed to the d efinitive feasibility study (DFS) stage. The Tiris uranium \nproject has an initial production profile of up to 1 million lb U 3O8 (385 tU) per annum, with the \nscoping study indicating an average life of mine over 15 years.  \nIn 2015 -2016, Aura continued to co nduct test- work and validation work aimed at defining \noptimal methods for the recovery of uranium. Additional verification/validation programmes \nwere completed, including downhole gamma logging, disequilibrium test -work, trenching of the \nmineralisation and  detailed ground radiometric surveying.  \nAura highlighted the very fine nature of the uranium -bearing mineral, carnotite. However, \nthis fine -grained character, together with the high, short -range grade, presents challenges in \nsampling. Carnotite tends to oc cur as small lenses, nuggets and coatings in or on the calcrete. \nIts distribution varies from deposit to deposit. This variability requires understanding and management in upgrading resources to measured and indicated status. In general, variability reduce s as sample size increases, and for that reason, the 2015 drilling employed a larger \ndiameter drill bit than that used in the earlier resource drilling programmes, resulting in a 50% \ngreater sample size. However, even with the larger sample size, grade var iability has still been \nrelatively high. To test the effectiveness of gamma logging at Tiris, 63  holes that had been drilled \nand cased in 2015 were gamma logged. Results of this work were positive, and Aura is now using \ndown gamma logging for its resource upgrade work.  \nIn 2016, the Tiris project progressed to the feasibility study stage. In 2017, Aura continued the \nTiris feasibility study, including the following activities: mining lease application, resource \ndefinition, geophysics for the definition of wat er resources and drilling, metallurgical progress on \ntest- work, simulation and flowsheet development, early -stage engineering, completion of an \nEnvironmental and Social Impact Assessment (ESIA), and a community consultation process.  \nIn 2017, a programme of  ground radiometric surveying was carried out over all Tiris uranium \nresource zones as well as priority exploration targets, such as Hippolyte South, that warrant \ndrilling. The surveys were conducted on lines spaced 20 m apart. A programme to increase the proportion of Measured and Indicated Resources commenced in May 2017. This involved an \nextensive drilling programme on a 50 m x 50 m pattern with each hole being gamma logged. \nA proportion of the holes have been drilled by large diameter triple tube diamon d drilling and \nthe core was chemically assayed to validate the downhole gamma logging and to obtain density \ndata throughout the zones drilled.  \nThe ESIA was completed in 2017 by Earth Systems. The ESIA pays attention to issues of \nradiation exposure and the security of the yellowcake product. Best practice guidelines from the \nInternational Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) and the International Commission on Radiological \nProtection (ICRP) have been used, complementing the applicable Mauritanian regulations and \nguid elines. The ESIA was approved by the Mauritanian government on 5 October 2017.  \nA programme of trenching was undertaken within the Lazare North and Lazare South \ndeposits in April 2018. A total of 11 trenches were completed, with 8 in the Lazare South and 3 in the Lazare North deposits. Trenches were dug to a depth of 4 m. The focus of this programme was to collect representative samples for detailed test -work.  \nOn 27 August 2021, Aura released the results of a new resources estimate of the Tiris East \ndeposits. The new resource estimate incorporates drill holes on the Sadi South Zone, not included in earlier resource estimates. This has resulted in a 2 080 tU increa se in the Tiris East resource.  \nNATIONAL REPOR TS: MAURITANIA  \n352 URA NIUM 202 2: RESOURCES, PRODUCTION AND DEMAND, NEA No. 7634, © OECD 202 3 Tiris West Resources (at a 85 ppm U cut -off – 2011 estimate)  \nDepo sit Category  Ore (Mt)  Grade (%U)  U (tU)  \nAgouyame  Inferred  2.6 0.0178  462 \nFerkik East  Inferred  4.5 0.0204  923 \nFerkik West  Inferred  11.9  0.0280  3 385  \nTotal Tiris East  Inferred  19.0  0.0251  4 770  \nTiris East Resources (at a 85 ppm U cut -off – 2021 estimate ) \nDeposit  Category  Ore (Mt)  Grade (%U)  U (tU)  \nHippolyte  Measured  \nIndicated  \nInferred  5.7 \n6.5 \n7.4 0.0191  \n0.0184  \n0.0238  1 077 \n1 192 \n1 769  \nHippolyte South  Indicated  \nInferred  4.8 \n3.1 0.0163  \n0.0149  769 \n462 \nHippolyte West  Inferred  6.3 0.0254  1 615  \nLazare Nort h Measured  \nIndicated  \nInferred  1.1 \n10.6  \n3.9 0.0241  \n0.0194  \n0.0178  269 \n2 077 \n692 \nLazare South  Measured  \nIndicated  \nInferred  3.4 \n2.6 \n9.1 0.0203  \n0.0186  \n0.0181  692 \n500 \n1 654  \nSadi  Indicated  \nInferred  4.5 \n14.9  0.0204  \n0.0226  923 \n3 346  \nTotal Tiris East  Measured  \nIndi cated  \nInferred  10.2  \n29.0  \n44.7  0.0200  \n0.0188  \n0.0213  2 038 \n5 461 \n9 538  \nUranium resources  \nIdentified conventional resources (reasonably assured and inferred resources)  \nIn 2012, Forte released a JORC code compliant U resource for the A 328 and Bin En Ar depos its. \nBased on an 85  ppm U cut -off (0.0085% U), global resources for the A 328 and Bin Ar deposits \ntotalled 385 tU in the indicated category, and 9 385  tU in the inferred category (in situ resources).  \nIn 2021, Aura released a new JORC code compliant resourc e estimation including the Sadi \nSouth Zone.

Aura’s exploration has largely focused on radiometric anomalies defined by  \nregional airborne radiometric surveys. In 2016, Aura estimated an additional potential of 19  000 tU \nin the Reguibat area.  \nNATIONAL REPORTS: MAURITANIA  \nURANIUM 202 2: RESOURCES, PRODUCTION AND DEMAND, NEA No. 7634, ©  OECD 20 23 353 Uranium production  \nIn 2014, Aura completed the Reguibat scoping study.  \nMineralisation occurs largely within 3 -4 m of the land surface , in gravels and weathered \ngranite. Most of the mineralisation occurs as single sheets with little or no cover. The material \nis largely unconsolidated and can be readily excavated by diggers or scrapers without blasting. \nThe overlying waste consists of loose windblown sand. The strip ratio is anticipated to be \napproximately 0.25:1.   \nSimple washing and screening tests on the ore yielded encouraging results. Wet screening at \n75 μm resulted in the rejection of 80% by weight with the retention of 91% of the ura nium into the \nscreen undersize. This represents a sevenfold upgrade factor from the 334 ppm U (0.0334% U) \nresource grade. These results may be explained by the extremely fine size and ready liberation of \nthe uranium mineral, carnotite, and the large differ ence in particle size distribution between the \ncarnotite and the bulk of the host rock minerals.  Following a series of encouraging small- scale \npreliminary tests, a standard leach test on - 300 μm beneficiated material confirmed earlier results, \nwith 92% uranium extraction within 4  hours and 95% after 8  hours.  \nThe total estimated initial capital cost for engineering, procurement, construction, \ncommissioning, start -up, and the owner’s activities for the project is AUD  50 million. The life of \nmine unit operating cost estimate for the Reguibat project is estimated to be USD  30.3/lb U 3O8 \n(USD 11.65/kgU). The planned operation will produce approximately 385 tU per year in years 2 \nand 3, followed by 250 tU for years 4 -11, and 270 tU in years 12 -15. The total uranium produced \nunder these assumptions is approximately 3  850 tU over the 15 -year mine life.  \nA feasibility study was undertaken in 2015, with a view to a simple truck and shovel mine \non the eastern deposit, feeding an AUD  50 million plant, and production at about 400  tU/yr.  \nOn 29 July 2019, Aura released the results of the Definitive Feasibility Study, whi ch \nconfirmed that the Tiris uranium project is a low cost and low operating cost development. The project is designed to support an open -pit mine, a 1.25  million tonnes of ore processing plant, \nand supporting infrastructure. The uranium mineralisation lies  largely within 3 to 5  m of the \nsurface in a relatively soft, free digging material containing patchy calcrete. Based on trenching and metallurgical test -work to date, the mineralisation does not require blasting before mining \nor crushing prior to beneficiation.  \nThree mining areas can be developed in a practical sequence to produce 310 -425 tU per year \nthrough the processing plant for over 15 years. The processing facility will consist of three main sections: the beneficiation circuit, the uranium extraction circuit (alkaline leach – solid liquid \nseparation – ion exchange), and the uranium purification and precipitation circuit. Uranium \nrecovery is expected to be 86.1%. Vanadium could be recovered as vanadium pentoxide (V\n2O5) \nthrough a standard precipitation  and purification process. Target production is 115  t V 2O5 per year. \nThe cost to develop and operate the mine for ten years has been estimated at USD  66 million, or \nUSD 2.24 per tonne of material mined. Total operating cash cost will be USD  25.43/lb U 3O8 \n(USD 66.1/kgU). The all -in sustaining cost (inclusive of royalties, LOM sustaining capital, \ninsurances and product transport) will be US D 29.81/lb U 3O8 (USD  77.5/kgU).  \nTwo exploitation licences covering 390  km2 were granted to Tiris Resources SA, a Mauritan ian \nregistered subsidiary of Aura  Energy Limited , on 8 February 2019.

Limited tec hnical and financial resources initially hampered national \nexploration efforts, but these problems were alleviated by government support, particularly from 1972 to 1980.  \nUntil 1979, exploration was performed by the National Institute of Nuclear Energy. In 1979, \nthe responsibility for exploration was vested in Uranio Mexicano (URAMEX). The areas explored, \nin order of importance, were in the states of Chihuahua, Nuevo León, Tamaulipas, Coahuila, \nZacatecas, Queretaro and Puebla. Uranium exploration was stopped  in May 1983 and URAMEX \nwas dissolved in February 1985.  \nIn 2009, the Mexican Geological Survey reactivated radioactive exploration in Mexico, to \nvalidate and re -evaluate the resources reported by URAMEX according to international standards. \nThis involves t he analysis of the preliminary information available, as well as complementary \nstudies of geology, geochemistry, geophysics and drilling, simultaneously exploring new locations with uranium potential.  \nIn order to gain a better knowledge of the uranium res ources located in Peña Blanca \n(Chihuahua State), Los Amoles (Sonora State) and La Coma area (Nuevo León State), exploration \nand assessment works were continued through drilling programmes. During the period 2013 -2016, \na total of 16 442 metres were drilled in 144 holes.  \nRecent and ongoing uranium exploration and mine development activities  \nIn the 2019- 2021 period, exploration activities slowed down from previous years, with no drilling \ncampaigns carried out.  \nDuring 2017 -2018, a total of 5 164 metres were dri lled in 47 holes with core recovery at Peña \nBlanca, Los Amoles and La Coma sites.  \nOther areas under study were Buenavista, Chapote, La Diana, Peñoles, La Presita, Trancas, \nDos Estados and Santa Fe in Nuevo León State using geological and radiometric prosp ecting \nmethods, which was done to develop a base map URAMEX drill holes made in the 1980s, and to \nassess the uranium mineralisation and geometry of the ore bodies.  \nIn Durango State, the main exploration activities have focused on Santiago Papasquiaro, \nwher e anomalies and evidence of surface and underground uranium minerals were defined.  \n  \nNATIONAL REPORTS: MEXICO  \nURANIUM 202 2: RESOURCES, PRODUCTION AND DEMAND, NEA No. 7634, ©  OECD 20 23 357 Uranium resources  \nIdentified conventional resources (reasonably assured and inferred resources)  \nPast evaluation of these projects by URAMEX did not fulfil the internationa l standards of \nevaluation.

At present, there are no plans for additional uranium production.  \nUranium requireme nts \nAs of 1 January 2021, two boiling water reactors with a total net installed capacity of 1.4  GW were \nin operation at the Laguna Verde Nuclear Power Plant. These two units have been in operation since 1990 and 1995, respectively, together supplying about  4-5% of the country’s electricity.  \nNATIONAL REPORTS: MEXICO  \n358 URA NIUM 202 2: RESOURCES, PRODUCTION AND DEMAND, NEA No. 7634, © OECD 202 3 In 2015, an application for a licence renewal of both Laguna Verde units was submitted to \nthe Mexican regulatory authority to allow their operation for an additional 30 years.  \nIn 2020, Mexico’ s Secretariat of Energy (S ENER) authorised the renewal of the operating \nlicence for unit 1 of the Laguna Verde Nuclear Power Plant for an additional 30 years to 2050. \nThe existing licence for unit 2 expires in May 2025.  \nSupply and procurement strategy  \nAn open bid system for uranium  purchases is under study for three reloads (2022 -2025).  \nUranium policies, uranium stocks and uranium prices  \nNational policies relating to uranium  \nThe 1984 Act on Nuclear activities, adopted pursuant to Article 27 of the Constitution, entered in force on 5  February 1985.

The first phase \nstarted immediately after World War II, with investigations directed at the search for uranium contained in other, non -uranium deposits. During the period 1945- 1960, numerous uranium \noccurrences were discovered in the brown coal deposits of eastern Mongolia.  \nThe second phase of exploration cover ed the period between 1970 and 1990. Under a bilateral \nagreement between Mongolia and the former Soviet Union, specialised geological surveys were \nconducted by the Geological Reconnaissance Expedition of the Soviet Ministry of Geology with a \nresult of 1  600 radioactive anomalies and hundreds of radioactive occurrences identified by the \njoint expedition. Full airborne gamma -ray spectrometric surveys at a scale of 1:25  000 and 1:50 000 \nwere conducted over 420 000 km\n2, covering about 27% of Mongolian territory ; at a scale of 1:200 000 \nover 450 000 km2, covering about 28% of the territory; and at a scale of 1:1  000 000 over 224 000 km2 \nin the Altai, Khangai mountains and Gobi Desert, covering about 14% of the Mongolian territory. The territory along the border w ith the People’s Republic of China and the central Mongolian \nmountain area, about 30% of the country, was not included in these surveys.  \nMetallogenic investigations at the scale of 1:500  000 over a 500 000 km\n2 area, and more \ndetailed geological mapping and  exploration at the scale of 1:200 000-1:50 000 over 50 000 km2 \nof territory in Mongolia, were also completed. This work included 2 684 000 m of surface drilling, \n3 179 000 m3 of surface trenching, and 20 800 m of underground exploration.  \nThe third phase o f exploration started in the 1990s with private stakeholder engagements \nincluding local and foreign entities. As a result of the depressed uranium market, exploration \nstrategies changed globally towards the exploration for low -cost uranium deposits, especially \nsandstone -type deposits. Uranium exploration was focused on Mesozoic and Cenozoic basins in \nsoutheast Mongolia. The “uranium” state -owned manufacturing enterprise, in co -operation with \nthe International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), assessed the uraniu m potential of Mongolia in \ntwo phases between 1993 and 2001. The studies that were completed focused on identifying the potential for uranium mineralisation in sedimentary and metasomatised settings.  \nBased on these surveys, the territory of Mongolia was c lassified into four uranium -bearing \nmetallogenic provinces: Mongol- Priargun, Gobi -Tamsag, Khentei -Daur and Northern Mongolia. \nEach of these provinces has a different geology and hosts different deposit types. Mineral \nassociations and ages of mineralisation  also vary. Within these provinces, 13 uranium deposits, \nabout 100  uranium occurrences and 1  400 showings and radioactive anomalies were identified.  \nThe Mongol -Priargun metallogenic province is located in eastern Mongolia, coinciding with a \n70 to 250 km wi de continental volcanic belt that can be traced over some 1  200 km, from the \nMongolian Altai to the Lower -Priargun region. This territory includes deposits and occurrences \nwith fluorite -molybdenum -uranium associations resulting from volcano- tectonic events . Distinct \nuranium mineralisation districts of the Northern Choibalsan, Berkh, eastern and central Gobi are included in this area. The Dornod ore field of Northern Choibalsan includes the uranium deposits \nof Dornod, Gurvanbulag, Mardaingol, Nemer and Ulaan, as well as other polymetallic and fluorite \nassociations. The Choir and Gurvansaikhan Basins of the eastern and central Gobi uranium mineralisation district include the Kharaat and Khairkhan uranium deposits, among others.  \n  \nNATIONAL REPORTS: MONGOLIA  \nURANIUM 202 2: RESOURCES, PRODUCTION AND DEMAND, NEA No. 7634, ©  OECD 20 23 361 The Gobi -Tamsag metallogenic p rovince covers a territory 1  400 km long by 60 to 180 km \nwide in southern Mongolia. It is characterised by numerous uranium occurrences in terrigenous \nsediments. The district includes a prospective uranium deposit in the south, near the Dulaanuul \nand Nars deposits, and numerous other occurrences, as well as other prospective uranium -\nbearing sedimentary basins, such as the Tamsag, Sainshand and Zuunbayan Basins, among others.  \nThe Henter -Daur metallogenic province (700  km long by 250 km wide) includes the Kha ngai \nand Khentii mountains. In this area, uranium occurrences in granite can be found, such as the \nJanchivlan ore field, which shows some promise of becoming a deposit of economic interest.  \nThe Northern Mongolian metallogenic province is the largest (1 500 km long by 450  km wide) \nof the four metallogenic provinces. The north -western part of Mongolia is characterised by a \nvariety of minerals such as uranium, thorium, and rare earth elements related to alkaline \nmineralisation, and uranium and thorium in metas omatites, pegmatite, magmatic, and quartz \nschist host rocks.  \nRecent and ongoing uranium exploration and mine development activities  \nThere are two types of uranium exploration activities in Mongolia: prospecting aimed at the \ndiscovery of new deposits and th e exploration of previously discovered deposits to increase \nresource endowments.  \nFour companies are carrying out exploration activities in Mongolia. From 2019 to 2020, the \nmajority of uranium prospecting was performed in the south Mongolian sedimentary bas ins to \nidentify sandstone -type uranium mineralisation that is amenable to in situ leaching (ISL) \nmining.  \nBadrakh Energy conducted major exploration and development activities during 2019 -2020 \nat the Zuuvch Ovoo and Dulaan Uul uranium deposits in Dornogobi  province in south -eastern \nMongolia. As a result, uranium resources  of the Zuuvch Ovoo d eposit were increased to \n93 291 tU and a technical report was submitted to the Mongolian Professional Committee of \nResources in February 2020. The deposit will be mined  by ISL using sulphuric acid.  The test \nmining  will be conducted  on 2 hexagonal  cells located  470 m from  each  other,  each  of which  \nwill consist  of 6 injection  wells  and one production  well.  Fifteen  groundwater  monitoring  wells  \nwere  drilled  and equipped outs ide and inside  of each  cell and at different  aquifer  horizons  along  \nthe direction  of groundwater  flow.  In 2021,  after  receipt  of all required  authorisations  from  \nMongolian  governmental  authorities,  including  the validation  of a Detailed  Environmental  \nImpac t Assessment  and Environmental  Management  Plan  2021,  Badrakh  Energy  started  the ISL \npilot  test at the North  ISL cell. On 10 August  2021,  the pilot  test successfully  produced  its first \nkilogram  of uranium  concentrate.  Operations  of the North  ISL cell contin ued for about  200 days  \nuntil  the end of January 2022  to provide  information  confirming  key technical  and economical \nparameters  for future  industrial production.  Cell #2 is expected  to start mining  when  mining  \nfrom  Cell #1 is completed.   \nThere are currently  eight deposits on which mining feasibility studies have been completed \nand approved by the Mongolian Professional Committee of Resources.  \nUranium exploration expenditures amounted to MNT 418.7 million (Mongolian tugrug) in 2019, \nMNT  197.2  million in 2020,  and MNT  209.4 million in 2021. No exploration drilling was completed \nin 2020, compared with 1 100 m reported in 2019.  \nIdentified conventional resources (reasonably assured and inferred resources)  \nAs of 1 January 2021, Mongolia’s total identified conventional recoverable resources amounted \nto 144 620 tU, while in situ resources comprised 192 241 tU. Recoverable conventional resources \ninclude 66 234 tU of reasonably assured resources (RAR) and 78 386 tU in the inferred category. \nAll resources are recoverable  at <USD  130/kgU, and 16 884 tU are recoverable at a cost of \n<USD  80/kgU by the acid ISL method.  \nNATIONAL REPORTS: MONGOLIA  \n362 URA NIUM 202 2: RESOURCES, PRODUCTION AND DEMAND, NEA No. 7634, © OECD 202 3 Undiscovered conventional resources (prognosticated and speculative resources)  \nAs of 1 January 2021, prognosticated resources amount to 13 300 tU, and specula tive resources \ntotalled 1 319 000 tU.  \nUnconventional resources and other materials  \nNo unconventional resources have been identified.  \nUranium production  \nHistorical review  \nUranium production in Mongolia started with the operation of the Dornod open -pit mine  in the \nMardai -gol district in 1989, based on the known uranium resources at the Dornod and \nGurvanbulag deposits. With an ore grade of 0.12% U, mining production was 2  400 tU/year. \nMongolia has no processing facilities. The ores mined in the Mardai- gol district were transported \n484 km by rail to the Priargunsky mining and processing facility in Krasnokamensk, Russia, for \nprocessing. Because of political and economic changes in Mongolia and neighbouring areas of \nRussia, uranium production at Erdes was termin ated in 1995.  \nUranium production centre technical details  \n(as of 1  January 2021)  \n Centre #1  Centre #2  Centre #3  \nName of production centre  Emeelt mines  Gurvansaihan  Badrakh energy  \nProduction centre classification  Planned  Planned  Planned  \nDate of first pro duction (year)  NA NA NA \nSource of ore:         \nDeposit name(s)  Gurvanbulag  Kharaat  Khairkhan  Gurvansaikhan  Ulziit  Dulaan  \nuul Zuuvch  \novoo \nDeposit type(s)  Volcanic  Sandstone  Sandstone  Sandstone  Sandstone  Sandstone  Sandstone  \nIn situ resources (tU)  13 058  7 288  8 407  4 250  3 076  11 896  93 291  \nGrade (% U)  0.152  0.026  0.071  0.034  0.036  0.022  0.022  \nMining operation:         \nType (OP/UG/ISL) UG ISL ISL ISL ISL ISL ISL \nSize (tonnes ore/day)  NA NA NA NA NA NA NA \nAverage mining recovery (%)  NA NA NA NA NA NA NA \nProcessing plan         \nAcid/alkaline  Acid  Acid  Acid  Acid  Acid  Acid  Acid  \nType (IX/SX)  IX IX IX IX IX IX IX \nSize (tonnes ore/day)  NA NA NA NA NA NA NA \nAverage process recovery (%)  NA NA NA NA NA NA NA \nNominal production capacity \n(tU/year) NA NA NA NA NA NA NA \nPlans for expansion  No No No No No No No \n \nNATIONAL REPORTS: MONGOLIA  \nURANIUM 202 2: RESOURCES, PRODUCTION AND DEMAND, NEA No. 7634, ©  OECD 20 23 363 Status of production facilities, production capability, recent and ongoing activities and other \nissues \nCurrently, no uranium is being produced in Mongolia.

©  OECD 20 23 367 Namibia \nUranium exploration and mine  development  \nHistorical review  \nUranium was first discovered in the Namib Desert in 1928 in the vicinity of the Rössing \nMountains, but it was not until the late 1950s that the Anglo American Corporation of South Africa prospected the area through drilling a nd limited underground exploration. As a result of \nerratic uranium prices, lack of demand, and limited economic prospects for uranium at that \ntime, Anglo American abandoned its work.  \nWith the upswing in the uranium market demand and prices, extensive urani um exploration \nstarted in Namibia in the late 1960s. Several airborne radiometric surveys were conducted, and \nnumerous anomalies were identified. In 1966, after discovering uranium occurrences, Rio Tinto acquired the rights to the low -grade Rössing deposit , located 65 km inland from the town of \nSwakopmund on the Atlantic coast. Trekkopje, a near -surface calcrete deposit just north of \nRössing and Langer Heinrich, another calcrete deposit situated 50  km southeast of Rössing, were \nalso discovered during this p eriod.  \nMining commenced in 1976 at Rössing and exploration intensified as uranium prices \nincreased sharply.  However, in the early 1980s , the sharp decline in uranium prices caused a rapid \ncurtailment of exploration and mine development efforts. This was un timely as refined and \nproven exploration techniques appeared poised to discover new deposits.  \nBeginning in 2003, rising uranium prices once again stimulated extensive exploration \nactivity, mainly in the Namib Desert. Based on earlier successes, two major t ypes of deposits \nwere targeted: intrusive- type associated with alaskite, as at Rössing, and surficial calcrete -type \ndeposits, as at Langer Heinrich.  \nIn 2002, Paladin Energy bought the Langer Heinrich tenement.  The Langer Heinrich surficial, \ncalcrete -hoste d uranium deposit is in  the Namib Naukluft National Park (NNNP), approximately \n85 km east northeast of the major Walvis Bay seaport. The ore occurs over 15 km in a paleochannel \nsystem approximately 50 m deep, and an exploration prospecting licence covers t he western \nextension of the mineralised Langer Heinrich paleochannel. In 2015, this prospecting licence was \nconverted to a mining licence. Originally identified in situ resources amounted to 49 179 tU at an average grade of 0.040% U.  \nConstruction at the L anger Heinrich project commenced in September 2005 and staged \ncommissioning of the plant began in August 2006. Mining commenced in 2007 with a proposed \n25-year life. Due to sustained low uranium prices, Langer Heinrich was placed in care and \nmaintenance in August 2018. The mine is expected to remain in care and maintenance until the \nuranium spot price makes it economical to restart the facility on a sustainable basis.  \nIn 2005 French state- owned Orano (at that time Areva) purchased Trekkopje from the \nCanadi an company UraMin and began construction of an alkaline heap leach mine in 2008, as well \nas an associated seawater desalination plant. The Trekkopje Project, located approximately 65 km \nnortheast of the coastal town of Swakopmund, embodies the Klein Trekkopje and Trekkopje \nsurficial uranium deposits, with 80% of the mineralisation contained in the top 15  m of strata \nbelow the surface. Hosted in calcium carbonate cemented (calcrete) conglomerates of Cenozoic \nage, the basal channels in the Trekkopje area foll ow the northeast trending structural grain of the \nunderlying basement rocks. The mine was developed in a staged process, with Phase  1 (“Mini ”), \ndesigned to validate the chemistry of the heap leach process successfully completed in 2009. Phase 2 (“Midi ”) treated 3 million tons of ore to prove the commercial process before scaling up to full \nNATIONAL REPORTS: NAMIBIA  \n368 URA NIUM 202 2: RESOURCES, PRODUCTION AND DEMAND, NEA No. 7634, © OECD 202 3 production. Phase 3 ( “Maxi ”) represented the full production stage of the mine, which was \nexpected to produce about 3 000 tU per annum. However, due to the depressed uran ium market, \nthe mine was put on care and maintenance at the end of 2012. As of 1 January 2013, known \nresources for Klein Trekkopje and Trekkopje amoun ted to over 45 000 tU at 0.013%  U. \nOther uranium projects that were issued mining licences at the time but  have not \ncommenced construction are the Norasa (original name Valencia) and the Zhonge Projects.   \nDiscovery holes for the Husab (initially known as Rössing South) uranium deposit were \ndrilled in late 2007 and chemical assay results were released in Februa ry 2008. Swakop Uranium \nhad in total completed over 800 000 m of combined reverse circulation and diamond core \ndrilling since the drilling programme began in 2006. In 2008, Extract Resources discovered the Husab uranium deposit.  \nExploration efforts contin ued, but low uranium prices since 2011, partly because of the \nFukushima Daiichi accident, slowed activity. Nonetheless, substantial growth in uranium \nexploration took place in the Erongo area of west -central Namibia, focused mainly on previously \nknown depo sits with considerable historical data. For example, Bannerman Mining Resources \nPty Ltd progressed the Etango Project from an initial scoping study (2007) and pre -feasibility study \n(2009) to a definitive feasibility study in 2012. It then built a heap leac h demonstration plant in \n2015 to test the proposed metallurgical process. In total, over 300  000 m of exploration drilling \nhas been completed in the Etango Project area.  \nFor the Rössing mine , a positive evaluation of extending the mine life led to the expa nsion \nof the existing pit to expose more of the steeply dipping ore body  known as SJ . Between 2007 \nand 2010, exploration was focused on extensions of the main SJ ore body, as well as the adjacent \nSK and SH ore bodies. However, the SK body contains largely refractory mineralisation (betafite) \nfor which the existing process plant is not suited. Since 2010, the main exploration focus has been on the southernmost Z20 deposit that extends across the lease boundary into the adjacent \nlease held by Husab. A total of 24 000 m of drilling was completed on Z20 to determine inferred \nresources by the end of 2012, and a third phase of drilling on the Z20 ore body was completed during 2013. Data indicated in situ resources of over 46  000 tU at higher grades (0.023% U) than  \nin the main orebody.  \nOther uranium exploration companies that continued work include Marenica Energy \n(currently known as Elevate Uranium Ltd) and Reptile Mineral Resources and Exploration (Pty) Ltd (RMR). RMR is a wholly owned Namibian registered subsidia ry of the Australian public \ncompany Deep Yellow Limited (DYL). Active in Namibia since 2006, RMR holds three exclusive prospecting licences including the Omahola, Tubas, Tumas and Aussinanis deposits, which are situated in the NNNP. Deposits are hosted in alaskite granites and in surficial paleochannel \ncalcrete and sand sediments. The Tumas palaeochannel system extends over more than 100  km. \nIt contains secondary uranium mineralisation (carnotite) in fluviatile grits, calcrete and gravel \nsequences in a comp lex palaeochannel system. The Tubas Sand Project consists primarily of \nlow-grade secondary uranium mineralisation (carnotite) in well -sorted aeolian sediments. The \nAussinanis deposit (MDRL3498) forms a shallower palaeochannel system, also with carnotite rich calcrete. RMR is also the manager of the Nova Joint Venture (NJV), which includes Tumas \nNorth and Chungochoab deposits. All tenements are situated in the NNNP.  \nMetals Australia Ltd owns 100% of the Mile 72 uranium project, located near Henties Bay on \nthe west coast of Namibia. The project is considered prospective for calcrete and gypcrete hosted \nuranium mineralisation as well as alaskite hosted uranium. A high -resolution airborne \ngeophysical survey, radon cup, surface trenching and drilling exploration  activities have been \nconducted. Activity during 2015 and 2016 was restricted to geological and economic assessments.  \nOver 60 exploration licences were issued until early 2007, when the Namibian government \nimposed a moratorium on new licences pending the development of new policies and legislation, \nprimarily in response to concerns about the water and energy requirements of uranium mining.  \nNATIONAL REPORTS: NAMIBIA  \nURANIUM 202 2: RESOURCES, PRODUCTION AND DEMAND, NEA No. 7634, ©  OECD 20 23 369 Recent and ongoing uranium exploration and mine development activities  \nIn January 2017, the Namibian government lifted the 10 -year moratorium on new applications \nfor exploration licences for nuclear fuel minerals, and since then, 52 new licences have been \ngranted as of the end of 2019.  \nRössing  \nA revision of the pricing outlook resulted in the removal of the Z20 and Phase 4 mineralised \nzone from the 2018 JORC compliant resource declaration. This decision was taken as a result of  \na financial analysis, which demonstrated that with the revised downward pricing outlook, the \nZ20 deposit would not contribute any additional value to the existing SJ Pit operations. However, \nthe resources contained within the Phase 4 pushback, as well as the inferred resources within the Phase 2 and 3 pushbacks, continue to demonstrate  value.  \nLanger Heinrich  \nThere has been no recent exploration activ ity due to continued low uranium prices.  Paladin \nreleased the Mine Restart Plan in June 2020,  setting a pathway to transition back into reliable \nproduction, with targeted investment to maximise plant reliability and runtime. During 2020 \nthe Langer Heinrich  Mine activities continued under a care and maintenance plan . There were \nno production or development activities during this period. The mine is expected to remain in \ncare and maintenance until the uranium spot price makes it economical to restart the faci lity \non a sustainable basis.  \nTrekkopje  \nThe operation is in care and maintenance  status , during which time Orano has conducted \nresearch to improve uranium recovery. An optimised process was developed that enhances \npermeability in the heap by adding cement at the agglomeration stage and recovery of a \nsubstantial part of the reagents used is accomplished through membrane technology. The desalination plant built in association with the mine continued to supply sufficient water to meet \nthe demand of other uraniu m mines and other users in the coastal area. Production capacity was \nboosted to 1 million m\n3/month to meet increased demand when the Husab mine began production.  \nHusab  \nThe main part of the Husab orebody lies approximately 5  km south of the Rössing mine. Th e \n8-km long uranium deposit lies under a cover of shallow alluvial sand. Estimated in situ \nidentified resources for all deposits currently licensed to Swakop Uranium (Husab and Ida Dome \ndeposits) amount to 234 000 tU grading at about 0.03% U, 136 000 tU of  which in the RAR category.  \nEtango  \nBannerman Resources ’ Etango Project consists of three prospects: Anomaly A, Oshiveli and \nOnkelo. These prospects contain uraniferous sheeted leucogranite alaskites bodies, very similar \nto those at Rössing. Although exten sions continue to 400  m below the surface, two -thirds of the \nresource base is located less than 200 m below the surface. Bannerman is also investigating \npotential satellite pit opportunities at Ondjamba and Hyena deposits. Total identified in situ \nuranium resources amount to about 82 400 tU, including 57 850 tU RAR.  \nReptile Mineral Resources (RMR) Projects  \nTotal identified in situ resources amount to 75 353 tU: 17 348 tU of which occur at the Omahola \nProject, including the Ongolo and MS7 alaskite as well as the Inca skarn deposits, and 58 005 tU \nare contained in the Tumas, Tubas and Aussinanis surficial calcrete deposits.  \nTumas Project : work continued expanding the calcrete associated uranium mineralisation \nin Tumas 1, 2 and 3 and Tubas zones, collectivel y referred to as the Tumas Project. Between \n2017 and 2020, work focused on advancing the Tumas and Tubas projects by expanding the \ncalcrete associated uranium resources at the Tumas 1 East, 1, 2 and 3 deposits, as well as at the \nNATIONAL REPORTS: NAMIBIA  \n370 URA NIUM 202 2: RESOURCES, PRODUCTION AND DEMAND, NEA No. 7634, © OECD 202 3 Tubas Red Sand and Calcrete  deposits. A total of 1 663 reverse circulation (RC) holes amounting \nto more than 30  000 m were drilled between 2019 and May 2021. Drilling work aimed at \nextending the mineral resources and converting them to a higher confidence level. These \ndeposits colle ctively contain 51 080 tU grading approximately 0.020% U. In addition, 30 diamond \ncored holes totalling 602 m were drilled to collect sample material for metallurgical test -work .  \nBetween 2019 and 2021 the focus was to advance the Tumas Project by conducti ng a scoping \nstudy that directly led into a pre -feasibility study (PFS). The PFS was completed with positive \nresults in February 2021.  It confirmed the technical and economic viability of the project , \ndelivering the following key outcomes:  \n• Utilises only 50 % of the total available mineral resources.  \n• Inferred resources converted to indicated resources at a rate of 95%.  \n• Established a maiden ore reserve at a 63% conversion rate from indicated resources to \nprobable reserves.  \n• Confirmed or improved of the Tumas sc oping study assumptions.  \nOn the back of the PFS results, the decision was made to immediately proceed with a \ndefinitive feasibility study (DFS), with a key focus on enhancing and further optimising the \ndevelopment option recommended in the PFS. A drilling programme is underway to define sufficient indicated and measured resources outlined as being required by the PFS. The DFS is \nexpected to be completed towards end of 2022. RMR has commenced an e nvironmental impact \nassessment (EIA) and is preparing for a mi ning lease application (MLA).  \nAussinanis Project: Contains approximately 7 000  tU of indicated and inferred in situ resources \ngrading at about 0.02%  U. Due to the depressed uranium market and the fact that EPL3498 is \nconsidered fully explored, an applicat ion was made in May 2017 for a Mineral Deposit Retention \nLicense (MDRL) and the Ministry of Mines and Energy (MME) granted the application in January \n2020.  \nRMR is also manager of the Nova JV, which is explor ing two greenfield exclusive prospecting \nlicences  (EPLs ) in the NNNP . Exploration undertaken between 2017 and 2020 identified several \nuranium prospects, but in  situ resources are yet to be identified. The most prospective target is \nBarking Gecko (EPL3669), where uranium mineralisation is hosted by alaski tic dykes . In 2020 drilling \ndelineated two prospective zones, namely Barking Gecko North and Barking Gecko South.   \nMarenica  \nElevate Uranium Ltd (former ly Marenica Energy) has a 75% interest in the project, while the \nother partners are Xanthos Mining Limit ed (20%) and Millennium Minerals (5%). The Marenica \nProject includes the calcrete -hosted uranium deposits of Marenica and MA7 located in the same \npalaeochannel system that hosts Orano ’s Trekkopje uranium deposit, which has similar \nmineralogical characteris tics to Marenica. The Marenica Project has i dentified mineral \nresource s of 23 579 tU (61.3Mlb U 3O8) at 0.008% U (93 ppm U 3O8).  \nDuring 2015 and 2016,  the company suspended all drilling activities due to depressed market \nconditions and focused on metallurgical testing of so- called “U -pgrade” beneficiation processes \nto increase the grade of mined ore prior to leaching. Feed grade can be elevated by over 50 times to ~5  000 ppm U\n3O8 (~ 4 200 ppm  U). Calcite rejection has also enabled the proposed leach circuit \nto be changed from an alkali leach (with higher operating temperatures and slower kinetics) to acid (at ambient temperature and rapid kinetics), thereby reducing expected capital expenses \nand operating costs.  \nIn mid -2020, Elevate Uranium announced a new u ranium discovery at EPL 7278 ( “Hirabeb” ). \nExploration on the tenement identified a massive palaeochannel system that extends over  \n36 kilometres. The primary palaeochannel is mineralised over most of  its length with the \npotential to host a significant urani um deposit. An a irborne electromagnetic survey, flown in \nApril 2021, covered the Hirabeb tenement and is expected to expand on the palaeochannel system. Furthermore, Elevate announced the discovery of a new palaeochannel system at EPL \n7662 (Namib IV) that is 19 km long and as wide as 6  km.  \nNATIONAL REPORTS: NAMIBIA  \nURANIUM 202 2: RESOURCES, PRODUCTION AND DEMAND, NEA No. 7634, ©  OECD 20 23 371 Happy Valley  \nLocated approximately 110  km northeast of Swakopmund and east of Rössing, the Happy Valley \nProject area was granted to Zhonghe Resources on 1  August 2006. Zhonghe is a Namibian \nregistered company founded in  2008 by the China National Uranium Corporation (CNUC; 58%), \na wholly owned subsidiary of the CNNC, and co- owned by two private companies, China Mineral \nResources Investment and Development P/L Nam -China (21%), and Springbok Investment Ltd \n(21%).  \nExplorat ion work was started in the area in 2007 and JORC compliant in situ resources \namounting to 40 730 tU at 0.016% U were defined. A feasibility study was undertaken from 2013 \nto 2018 while Zhonge Resources continued to focus on resource evaluation and economic \nreassessment. Since CNUC has taken over Rössing Uranium Limited, the Zhonge Resources project could serve as a backup resource for Rössing Uranium Ltd.  \nEngo Valley  \nThe Engo Valley Project consists of a series of uranium anomalies exposed in and adjacent  to \nKaroo sedimentary rocks. The project is located 600  km north of Swakopmund, on the Skeleton \nCoast of northern Namibia. The licence was relinquished in 2014 following a review of the \nproject considering its remote location.  \nWings *  \nIn south -eastern Nami bia, Russian -owned Uranium One, through its Namibian daughter \ncompany Headspring Investments Pty., conducted ground geophysical and geochemical surveys during 2016- 2017, completed metallurgical test studies of core with uranium mineralisation in \n2018, and began systematic intensive exploration drilling in 2019. Exploration drilling volumes \nincreased from 9 430 m in 2019 to 34 818 m in 2020. As a result of 2019- 2020 activities, a new \nsandstone -type uranium deposit was  discovered with resources confirmed by a  JORC compliant \ntechnical report amounting to: indicated (RAR) resources worth 14 700 tU, inferred resources \nworth 9 900 tU and exploration potential of 40 000 tU. Based on 2020 exploration and \nhydrogeological test results , resources are potentially amenab le for development by ISL. A PFS \ncompleted in 2021 has confirmed positive economics for the ISL mining method with all in \nproduction cash cost of USD 54.2/kgU. The 2021 exploration programme included a further \n42 440 m of drilling aimed at the identificati on of additional resources and preparation for an \nISL pilot test. This is the first time that sandstone -type mineralisation potentially amenable for \nISL recovery has been discovered in Namibia.  \nIdentified conventional resources (reasonably assured and infe rred resources)  \nTotal identified in situ conventional resources in Namibia  amounted to 636 916 tU as of 1 January \n2021. Recoverable known resources amounted to 509 532 tU, including 322  822 tU in the \nreasonably assured and 186  711 tU in the inferred resour ce categories. The average overall \nrecovery factor for all mining and processing methods is 80%. Deposits in Namibia are typically \nlarge and low grade. About 92% of the recoverable identified uranium resources are classified in \nthe <USD  130/kgU cost catego ry, with the remainder re ported in the <USD 130 and <USD  260/kgU \ncategories. For the first time , Namibia has report ed recoverable resources in the <USD 80 kg/U \ncategory , amounting to 19 680 tU that belong to the Wings sandstone -type deposit potentially \name nable for ISL mining.  \nCompared with data as of 1 January 2019, there has been an increase of 5 308 tU in total \nrecoverable and 6  636 tU in in situ resources. This is the result of additional resources identified \nat Tumas and Wings and decreases due to 201 9 and 2020 mining depletion at the Husab and \nRössing mines, along with re -estimation of historical resources at Trekkopje.  \n                                                      \n*  Information provided by Russia.  \nNATIONAL REPORTS: NAMIBIA  \n372 URA NIUM 202 2: RESOURCES, PRODUCTION AND DEMAND, NEA No. 7634, © OECD 202 3 Undiscovered conventional resources (prognosticated and speculative resources)  \nUndiscovered resources are estimated in areas adjacent  to deposits with identified resources in \nHappy Valley, Etango, Tumas, Husab and Wings.

Rio Tinto was the \nleading shareholder with 51.3% of the equity when the company was formed. Rio Tinto subsequently increased its stake to 69% of the project. Mine development commenced in 1974 \nand initial production began in July 1976, but full design capacity of 3  845 tU/y was not achieved \nbecause of the highly abrasive nature of the ore, an aspect not identified during the pilot plant \ntesting stage. The production target was eventually reached in  1979 after plant design changes \nwere implemented. From the date of first production in July 1976 to the end of 2020, a \ncumulative total of over 120  000 tU  had been produced at Rössing. In 2019, Rio Tinto plc sold its \n69% share in Rössing to CNUC, a wholly  owned subsidiary of government -owned CNNC. CNNC \nis a significant player throughout the entire nuclear fuel cycle and it plans to keep the Rössing \noperation in production.  \nPaladin Energy Ltd. (currently Paladin) acquired Langer Heinrich project (LHU) from Aztec \nResources Ltd (formerly Acclaim Uranium NL) in August 2002. In July 2014 , Paladin Energy sold \na 25% interest in the mine to CNNC Overseas Uranium Holding Limited, a wholly owned \nsubsidiary of CNNC. Construction of the Langer Heinrich project commence d in September 2005 \nand staged commissioning of the plant began in August 2006. Mining commenced in 2007 with \na proposed 25 -year life to 2030. The initial planned production level of 1  040 tU/yr was achieved \nin 2008. This was followed by the Stage 2 expans ion to 1  350 tU/yr in 2010. Stage 3 expansion to \n2 030 tU/yr was completed in 2012. A Stage 4 expansion feasibility study and an environmental \nimpact assessment were submitted to the government, but subsequently the project was put \non hold. Due to sustaine d low uranium prices, the Langer Heinrich Mine (LHM) was placed in \ncare and maintenance in August 2018.  \nSwakop Uranium developed and constructed the Husab mine , situated approximately 5  km \nsouth of the Rössing mine and 45  km northeast of Walvis Bay port. The project received \nenvironmental clearance in January 2011 and a mining licence later that same year. An \nenvironmental clearance certificate was awarded in December 2011. Construction commenced in October 2012 and the first uranium oxide was drummed in D ecember 2016. Construction of Husab \ncreated more than 6 000 temporary jobs. Until April 2012, Swakop  Uranium was a fully owned \nsubsidiary of Extract Resources, an Australian company listed on the Australian, Canadian and Namibian stock exchanges. In March 2012, Chinese state -owned China Guandong Nuclear Power \nCorporation (CGNPC) acquired the project in a takeover bid worth USD 2.4 billion. In November \n2012, Epangelo, the Namibian state -owned mining company, finalised an agreement with Swakop \nUranium under w hich Namibian state company Epangelo obtained a 10% stake in Swakop \nUranium.  \nStatus of production facilities, production capability, recent and ongoing activities, and \nother issues  \nTotal uranium production in Namibia declined from 3 246 tU in 2014 to 2 992 tU in 2015 but then \nrebounded to 3 593 tU in 2016. Production continued to increase to 4 221 tU in 2017 and 5 520 tU \nin 2018. The s tart-up of the Husab mine is the main reason for national production increases \nsince 2016. In 2020, uranium production in Na mibia amounted to 5  412 tU, 3 301 tU of which \nwas produced at Husab and 2 111 tU at Rössing.  \nNATIONAL REPORTS: NAMIBIA  \nURANIUM 202 2: RESOURCES, PRODUCTION AND DEMAND, NEA No. 7634, ©  OECD 20 23 373 Rössing  \nProduction at Rössing Uranium has steadily increased over the last few years as the mine has \naccessed higher -grade ore after the Phase 2 and 3 pushbacks: from 1 055 tU in 2015, production \nhas increased gradually to 2  111 tU in  2020 and 5  753 tU in 2021 . The higher -grade material does, \nhowever, come with increased calcium content, limiting processing plant capacity. To process the higher calcium carbonate co ntaining ores, the processing plant’s annual capacity was reduced to \n9.2 million tonnes per annum. The current mine plans foresee a cessation of Rössing production \nat the end of 2026.   \nLanger Heinrich  \nFrom the date of first production in March 2007 to the end of 2018, a total of 16  449 tU was \nproduced at the Langer Heinrich Mine ( LHM ). The operations at LHM were suspended in August \n2018 due to sustained low uranium spot prices , and t he mine was placed in care and \nmaintenance. There have been  no production or development activities since 2018. In June 2020, \nPaladin released the Mine Restart Plan , setting a pathway to transition back into reliable \nproduction, with targeted investment to maximise plant reliability and runtime. The mine is expected to remain in care and maintenance until the uranium spot price makes it economical \nto restart the facility on a sustainable basis . \nTrekkopje  \nFollowing Phase 1 trial mining with 250 000  t of ore and processing operations, Phase 2 pilot \ntests, heap leach trials (using a sodium carbonate/bicarbonate leach process) and construction \nof the main production pad in 2010, a final production level of 2  545 tU/yr (3  000 t U3O8/yr) was \nenvisaged. Production, which was limited to 251 tU and 186 tU in 2012 and 2013 respectively, \ndemo nstrated the feasibility of the technical process and confirmed production costs. However, \nas a direct consequence of low uranium prices, the project was placed in care and maintenance \nin mid -2013.  The mine is expected to remain under care and maintenance until the uranium \nprice makes it economical to restart production.  \nHusab \nWith a conventional, large -scale open -pit mine and a conventional agitated acid leach process \nplant, Husab has a nameplate capacity of 5 700 tU/ yr (15 Mlbs U 3O8/yr). Mining began in M ay \n2015 and uranium production reached 1 140 tU in 2017, rising to 3 026 tU in 2018 and maintaining \na level of 3 300 to 3 400 tU during 2019 -2020. The feasibility study showed a production cost of \nUSD  83/kgU (USD  32/lb  U3O8), including royalties, marketing  and transport, and a capital cost of \nUSD  1.66 billion. The mining fleet is expected to move 15 million tonnes of ore per year from \ntwo separate open pits to feed a processing plant producing 5 700 tU per year.  Total mining fleet \ndesign capacity for ore an d waste rock transportation is 120 million tons per annum.  \nFuture production centres  \nEtango  \nAfter receiving environmental approvals to proceed with development of the Etango mine, \ncompleting a scoping study in September 2007 and a preliminary feasibility s tudy, Bannerman \nResources confirmed the viability of the project with a long -term uranium price of about \nUSD  159/kgU (USD  61/lb  U3O8) with pre -production capital costs estimated at USD 870 million. \nAdditional work produced a reduction in break -even costs t o USD 135/kgU (USD 52/lb U 3O8) and  \nreduced capital costs to USD 793 million for 16 years of operation, producing 2 770 tU/y from a conventional open -pit mine. Subsequent work further  reduced the pre -production capital cost \nestimate to USD 720  million.  \nNora sa  \nWith estimated annual production of about 2  000 tU over a 15 -year mine life, at costs of \nUSD 86/kgU (USD  32.96/lb  U3O8) over the first 5  years of production, and USD  90/kgU (34.72/lb  U3O8) \nNATIONAL REPORTS: NAMIBIA  \n374 URA NIUM 202 2: RESOURCES, PRODUCTION AND DEMAND, NEA No. 7634, © OECD 202 3 over the mine life, the project is expected to start when urani um prices recover. Environmental \napproval for an open- pit mine was granted in June 2008 and a 25- year mining licence was granted \nin August 2008 to Valencia Uranium P/L (a wholly owned subsidiary of Forsys). In situ indicated \nresources of 44  200 tU and infe rred resources of 6  538 tU at a cut -off grade of 0.01% U have been \nestimated . \nUranium production centre technical details  \n(as of 1 January 2021)  \n Centre #1  Centre #2  Centre #3  Centre #4  Centre #5  Centre #6  \nName of production centre  Rössing  Langer \nHeinrich  Husab  Trekkopje  Norasa  Etango  \nProduction centre classification  Existing  Idled  Existing  Idled  Prospective  Prospective  \nDate of first production (year)  1976  2007  2016  2013  NA NA \nSource of ore:        \nDeposit name(s)  Rössing  \nSJ, SK,  Langer \nHeinrich  Husab  \nZones 1  \nand 2  Trekkopje, \nKlein \nTrekkopje  Valencia and \nNamibplaas  Etango  \nDeposit type(s)  Intrusive  Calcrete  Intrusive  Calcrete  Intrusive  Intrusive  \nRecoverable resources (tU)  34 134  36 874  181 455  36 445  40 590  65 416  \nGrade (% U)  0.025  0.045  0.033  0.012  0.017  0.016  \nMining operation:        \nType (OP/UG/ISL)  OP OP OP OP OP OP \nSize (tonnes ore/day)  26 000  N/A  42 000  30 800  33 000  55 000  \nAverage mining recovery (%)  85 N/A  88 90 77 90 \nProcessing plant:        \nAcid/alkaline  Acid  Alkaline  Acid  Alkaline  Acid  Acid  \nType (IX/SX)  IX/SX  IX IX/SX  HL/IX  IX/SX  HL/IX/NF  \nSize (tonnes ore/day)  26 000  N/A  40 000  100 000  30 000  55 000  \nAverage process recovery (%)  83 88 88 80 89 87 \nNominal production capacity (tU/year)  2 000  2 000  5 700  3 000  2 000  2 770  \nPlans for exp ansion (yes/no)  No Yes Yes No No No \nEmployment in the uranium industry  \nRössing employment has remained relatively stable from 967 employees in 2018 to 955 employees \nat the end of 2020 and 961 in 2021.

At Langer Heinrich, the \nnumber of employees decreased from 282 in 2017 to 19 at the end of 2018, when the operation was \nplaced in care and maintenance. The implementation of an optimise d care and maintenance plan \nresulted in a further reduction in total employees,  from 19 in 2019 to 14 in 2020.  \nEnvironmental activities and socio -cultural issues  \nNamibia’s “Vision 2030” spells out the country’s development programmes and strategies to \nachieve national objectives. It focuses on eight themes to realise the country’s long -term vision. \nUranium mine and exploration companies actively support these government objectives.  \nNATIONAL REPORTS: NAMIBIA  \nURANIUM 202 2: RESOURCES, PRODUCTION AND DEMAND, NEA No. 7634, ©  OECD 20 23 375 The Namibian Uranium Association  \nThe Namibian Uranium Association (NUA) is an advocacy body for the uranium industry, \nassisting senior executives in shaping the context in which their industry operates. It supports \npolicies that allow uranium to compete on its merits as a source for low -carbon energy \nappropriate for modern societ y through research, information and advocacy. Members of NUA \nspan all Namibian uranium mining operations, most of Namibia’s leading uranium exploration \ncompanies, and associated contractors.  \nNUA is the leading point of contact for government, media, stakeholders, and the general \npublic interested in the position and policies of the Namibian uranium industry. NUA promotes \nindustry adherence to sustainable development performance, product stewardship and \ncompliance within the Namibian legislative framework. A  key mission of the association’s \nUranium Stewardship programme is to “earn public trust for the global nuclear fuel cycle through \nthe continued replacement of standard practice with best practice”.  \nAs part of its stewardship mission, NUA established the N amibian Uranium Institute (NUI). \nThe NUI is guided by independent scientists who serve on its Scientific Committee. The main \npurpose of the NUI is to act as a communication hub for the industry in Namibia, and to promote \nknowledge and capacity building in specialised skills in the fields of environmental management, \nradiation safety and health. The NUI therefore provides an opportunity for NUA members to \ncollectively improve safety and health performance through the identification of world -class \nleading pra ctices and their implementation. As such, NUI is working closely with the Namibian \ngovernment and state agencies, as well as maintaining close ties to the Namibian University of \nScience and Technology.  \nEnvironmental Management Act, Act No. 7 of 2007  \nNamibi a committed itself to sound environmental management, as reflected in the \nEnvironmental Management Act, Act No. 7 of 2007 and Regulations, gazetted on 6 February 2012. \nThe object of the act is prevention and mitigation, following environmental management \nprinciples that:  \n• ensure that the significant effects of activities on the environment are considered in time \nand with care;  \n• ensure that there are opportunities for timely participation of interested and affected \nparties through the assessment process, and t hat the findings of an assessment are \nconsidered before any decision is made with respect to the activities.  \nThe Strategic Environmental Assessment and the Strategic Environmental Management \nPlan \nThe Erongo Region is characterised by aridity, vast desert l andscapes, scenic beauty, high \nbiodiversity and endemism, and heritage resources. It has the second -largest economy of all \nNamibian regions, and mining plays an important part. Walvis Bay and Swakopmund are \namong Namibia ’s five largest towns, but at the sa me time, large parts of the Erongo Region, \nespecially along the coast, are under active conservation as national parks.  \nMost of the Namibian uranium exploration and mining activities occur in the Central Namib, \nan ecologically sensitive area containing par ts of the Namib Naukluft and Dorob National Parks. \nMining and associated developments are vital for Namibian economic growth, and the country strives to reconcile development objectives and mineral exploitation with environmental protection to foster long -term socio -economic growth and stability. An integrated approach is \nrequired so that development of one resource will not jeopardise the potential of  another.  \nThe need for proper environmental planning in the framework of a comprehensive \nenvironmental asse ssment was therefore realised at an early stage when rising uranium prices in \nthe mid -2000s caused a uranium exploration rush. Apart from forming the U ranium Stewardship \ncommittee, a proposal was made for a strategic environmental assessment (SEA) that was  \nsubsequently carried out by the Geological Survey of Namibia. The Uranium -SEA, as it has become \nNATIONAL REPORTS: NAMIBIA  \n376 URA NIUM 202 2: RESOURCES, PRODUCTION AND DEMAND, NEA No. 7634, © OECD 202 3 known, dealt with a variety of topics, such as water, energy, air quality, radiation, health, transport, \ntourism, biodiversity, heritage, economics, education and governance. Following an independent \nassessment by the International Institute for Environment and Development, a Strategic \nEnvironmental Management Plan (SEMP) was created from the SEA findings and is being implemented by the Ministry of Mines and Ene rgy. The Namibian uranium industry has supported \nthe SEA process and is an active partner of government in the implementation of the SEMP.  \nPositive impacts noted in the SEA include stimulating the Namibian economy, as well as \ndeveloping skills and infrastr ucture. Constraints to development, such as possible water \nshortages, lack of skills, capacity of physical infrastructure and environmental protection, were also identified. The SEA noted that a uranium rush could impact natural physical resources, biodive rsity, health, infrastructure and tourism. Good governance will be critical in minimising \nthese impacts.  \nThe SEMP sets out several environmental quality objectives related to socio -economic \ndevelopment, employment, infrastructure, water, air quality and radiation, health, tourism, \necological integrity, education, governance, heritage and future developments, closure and land \nuse, which are to be continuously monitored as a collective proxy for measuring the degree to \nwhich uranium mine development activitie s are moving the Erongo Region towards a desired \nfuture state. An office has been established to administer the SEMP programme.  \nOne of the key aspects identified in the SEMP is water. Since 2010, water has been supplied \nto Trekkopje from a coastal desalina tion plant built by Areva (now Orano) capable of supplying \n20 million m\n3/yr and requiring 16 MWe from the grid. Desalinated water is also supplied via the \nNamibian Water Corporation to Rössing, Langer Heinrich and Husab. The SEMP stated that \nuranium mining , mine development and exploration have not compromised community access \nto water supplies of acceptable quality.  \nEnvironmental monitoring  \nUranium mining operations, in co -operation with the Environmental Affairs Department of the \nMinistry of Environment and Tourism, continue to actively monitor environmental issues of \nconcern. Best practices and shared experiences are encouraged by participatory environmental \nplanning and management to promote effective waste management practices. In addition to the \nSEMP,  Namibian Uranium Association members carry out additional environmental monitoring, \nverified by the government, to ensure that the mining footprint is as small as possible. Stringent water -saving measures, air quality and biodiversity monitoring, as well as the implementation of \nmitigation measures for adverse impacts and environmental training of staff are examples of \nthese efforts.  \nWell- established environmental monitoring programmes approved under the environmental \nclearance certificate granted by the M inistry of Environment and Tourism continue  to operate . \nRössing works to continuously improve environmental management programmes to maximise \nbenefits and minimise negative impacts. Key environmental management programmes include \nenergy efficiency and greenhouse gas emissions, air quality control (including emissions of dust \nand other impurities, as well as noise and vibration), water use, waste management (both mineral \nand non- mineral), chemical substance management and land use management (including \nbiodiversity, rehabilitation and closure).  \nThe mineral waste generated by Rössing Uranium in 2020 amounted to a total of 18.7  million \ntonnes (8.7  million tonnes of tailings and 10.0  million tonnes of waste rock). Tailings were \ndeposited in the existing tailings  storage facility. The tailings footprint has shown a slight \nincrease with 1.4 ha due to starter walls being built for the future deposition in the Y3 Paddy.  \nWaste rock was deposited in existing rock dumps close to the open pit with no extension of \nthe foo tprint. The total mineral waste inventory generated by Rössing over the last 44 years \namounts to roughly 1. 47 billion tonnes covering a total footprint of 1 488  ha. \nSince 1980, Rössing has been recycling 60 to 70% of its water. The 2020 Rössing operating p lan \nset and achieved a target for desalinated freshwater usage of 2.9 million m³ supplied by NamWater. \nSaline groundwater from the Khan River aquifer used for haul road dust suppression took only \n19.4% of the permitted volume in 2020.  \nNATIONAL REPORTS: NAMIBIA  \nURANIUM 202 2: RESOURCES, PRODUCTION AND DEMAND, NEA No. 7634, ©  OECD 20 23 377 Well- established env ironmental monitoring programmes approved under the environmental \nclearance certificate (ECC) granted by the Ministry of Environment and Tourism continued during \nthis reporting period. The LHU remains fully permitted to resume mining, production and \nuraniu m exports. Noteworthy were the LHU’s successful applications to:  \n• the Ministry of Environment, Forestry and Tourism for the extension of the e nvironmental \nclearance certificate (ECC) for ML140 and ML172;  \n• the Ministry of Agriculture, Water and Land Reform for extension of its Wastewater and \nEffluent Disposal Exemption Permit. A p ermit extension was issued for a period of five \nyears.  \nThe LHU continued submitting compliance reports as stipulated under various permitting \nand licencing conditions.  \nEnvironmental activities at Husab included continued compliance (routine audits, inspections, \nECC renewals, permit condition management, etc.) and bio -physical (planned surface and \ngroundwater, air quality, environmental radiation, biodiversity, etc.) monitoring. An application \nfor an on- site nursery for restoration trials w as filed and initiated. Good progress was made on \nthe social component of the mine rehabilitation, restoration and mine closure plan. Water \nrequirements continue to be met by desalinated water supply t hrough agreements with \nNamWater and Orano. An application for a permit to allow pit dewatering to be used for dust \nsuppression was made to the relevant authorities. A closed loop circuit in the Husab processing \nplant facilitates continual water recycling a nd the final treated effluent from the sewage \ntreatment plant is used for dust suppression. Husab continue to minimise raw water consumption \nthrough wastewater recycling from the dam to the processing plant.  \nLiaison with government agencies , through meeti ngs and site visits,  is ongoing . Bi-annual \ncompliance reports on mining and exploration activities are verified through external second -\nparty and third -party  audits. Amendments made to Husab environmental impact assessments \nfrom 2017 to 2019 were assessed through scoping reports issued for approval by government.  \nAn EIA for the Tumas Project mining lease application commenced in 2020. Baseline studies, \nincluding on groundwater, flora, fauna, radiation, air quality, noise, archaeology and socio -\neconomic imp acts, were completed and the results compiled in a Scoping Report that forms the \nbasis of the assessment and Environmental Management Plan. Environmental monitoring includes groundwater and dust sampling, the collection of weather data, and monitoring of \nnative flora. The RMR’s Safety, Health and Environmental Control Officer (SHECO) and its \nRadiation Safety Officer ensure compliance to the company’s Environmental Management Plan (EMP) for exploration activities and the Radiation Management Plan (RMP).  \nSite rehabilitation  \nAll Namibian uranium operators adhere to the Mine Closure Framework of the Chamber of \nMines of Namibia. The framework provides guidance to the mining industry on developing \nrelevant, practical and cost -effective closure plans and establish es minimum requirements for \nmembers bound by the Chamber ’s Code of Conduct and Ethics.  \nThe Rössing Environmental Rehabilitation Fund, established to provide for the mine ’s closure \ncosts, complies with statutory obligations and stipulated requirements of th e government. The \nfund requires an annual contribution by the mining company to provide for the total cost of the \neventual closure of the mine, expected in 2025. At the end of December 2020, the fund had a cash \nbalance of NAD 1 120million (USD 76  million).  \nCorporate  social responsibility  \nMembers of the NUA have undertaken corporate social responsibility projects for more than \nthree decades, with over 20 ongoing to address themes such as economic advancement, social progression, education and training, hunge r and poverty, water supply, sanitation and youth \nemployment.  \nNATIONAL REPORTS: NAMIBIA  \n378 URA NIUM 202 2: RESOURCES, PRODUCTION AND DEMAND, NEA No. 7634, © OECD 202 3 Rössing also promotes healthy, safe and environmentally responsible lifestyles among \nneighbouring communities, and makes direct contributions to initiatives targeting biodiversity \nprotection, co nservation education, health and safety (including HIV/Aids), and waste \nmanagement. Total investment in these corporate social activities in the year 2020 amounted \nto NAD 26 million (USD 1.6 million), including the donation of an Oxygen Plant to the public  \nhospital in the main port city of Walvis Bay.  \nThe LHU remains committed to addressing social aspects such as local procurement, \nrecruitment, employee development and involvement in the community. During this reporting \nyear, the LHU made donations to the N amib Anti -Poaching Unit and the Ministry of Environment, \nForestry and Tourism for use in the Namib Naukluft National Park. The provision of equipment \nand fuel to these organisations assists them in continuing critical conservation work.  \nThe Husab mine rema ins committed to addressing social aspects such as local procurement, \nrecruitment and employment, involvement in social responsibility programmes, training, \neducation and sound environmental management practices.  \nOrano engages with stakeholders at local, regional and national levels in the areas of economic \ndevelopment, education, culture and sport. Orano fully supports the Harambee Prosperity Plan.  \nBannerman Resources, even at an early stage of mine development, has focused on education \nand tourism as par t of its social programme, for example supporting over 2  000 disadvantaged \nprimary school children in the Erongo and other regions in Namibia.  \nRMR ’s CSR activities are focused on early childhood development, empowering people and \ncommunities through sport s, promoting a sustainable environment, and community support \nthrough food aid.  \nAtomic Energy and Radiation Protection Act, Act No 5 of 2005  \nThe Atomic Energy and Radiation Protection Act (Act No.5 of 2005) was gazetted on 16 January \n2012. Administered by the National Radiation Protection Authority, it provides for the regulation of all activities associated with radiation sources, radioactive or nuclear material.  \nThe primary purposes of the act are to protect people against the harmful effects of radiation , \nminimise environmental pollution that may be caused by radiological contamination, ensure the \nsafety of facilities and radiation sources, and guarantee that Namibia meets its obligations within \nthe context of international legal instruments in the sector  of radiation or nuclear technologies.  \nRegulatory regime \nNamibia has host ed uranium mining for more than 45 years. The sector is governed by a range of \ncomprehensive legislation s for uranium exploration and mining, starting with the Namibian \nConstitution , which  provides for the protection of the environment and the welfare of people . \nUranium mining is regulated by the Minerals (Prospecting and  Mining)  Act 33 of 1992. Section 2 of \nthis Act vests all rights with respect to minerals to the state. Environmental  issues are regulated \nby the Minister of Environment and Tourism. The Minister of Mines and Energy may not issue a mineral licence before the applicant has obtained an environmental clearance certificate.  \nFurthermore, the Minerals (Prospecting and Mining)  Act 33 sets the terms and conditions for \ngranting exploration and mining licences. Section 102 of this Act prohibits the processing, import, export or possession of source material without the Minister ’s written authorisation. Health and \nsafety aspects re lating to the minerals industry are administered in terms of the previous Mines, \nWorks and Minerals Ordinance 20 of 1968.  \nNamibia ’s Environmental Management Act underlines the importance of consultation with \ninterested and affected parties. It promotes su stainable environmental management and use of \nnatural resources by establishing principles for decision making and environmental impact assessment regulations.  \n  \nNATIONAL REPORTS: NAMIBIA  \nURANIUM 202 2: RESOURCES, PRODUCTION AND DEMAND, NEA No. 7634, ©  OECD 20 23 379 Namibia is party to the Nuclear Non -Proliferation Treaty, has had a comprehensive \nsafeguards agreement in force since 1998, and in 2000 signed and ratified the Additional Protocol.  \nIn July 2008, the government established the Epangelo Mining Company to participate in the \nmining sector, and as per the provisions of the Minerals (Prospecting and Min ing) Act, to acquire \nmining rights and equity by concluding joint ventures with existing companies. The Namibian \ngovernment is the sole shareholder of Epangelo. Namibia has identified uranium as a strategic \nmineral and potential source of energy, expressin g its desire to enhance economic development \nthrough potential local fuel cycle facilities and by considering nuclear power to augment its \nenergy needs.  \nUranium requirements  \nAt present, Namibia has no nuclear power generating facilities. Namibia produces p ower locally \nand imports about half  of its electricity, with the bulk of this being supplied by Eskom in South \nAfrica and the balance by ZESCO in Zambia.  \nNational policies relating to uranium  \nThe government has designated its uranium resources as strategic  and controlled minerals that \nmust be treated differently from other minerals because of, among other reasons, the risk of \nproliferation, radiological risks and their use as fuel for generating electricity.  \nGiven the special nature of uranium and its radio logical and fissile properties, the government \nis developing responsive regulatory frameworks to address health, safety, research and \ndevelopment applicable to the nuclear fuel cycle. Because Namibia is considering the \ndevelopment of commercial nuclear pow er to promote energy security and meet its increasing \nenergy needs without increasing greenhouse gas emissions, it has developed a Nuclear Fuel Cycle Policy to examine the potential value addition of  yellow cake.\n \nUranium exploration and development expendi tures and drilling effort –  domestic  \n(NAD – Namibian

development  \nHistor ical review  \nSince 1972, the Department of Mines and Geology (DMG) has been engaged in the exploration of \nuranium resources in Nepal through ground radiometric and spectrometric surveys.  \nA ground radiometric survey was initiated in 1972 over part of the Pal ung and Ipa granites \nof the Makawanpur and Lalitpur districts.  \nSystematic ground exploration for uranium in sedimentary rocks, using scintillation \ncounters, was launched in 1981. From 1981 to 1987, radiometric surveys covered about 8 000 km² \nof the Siwalik Range.  \nIn 1982, radiometric surveys were carried out in the Thumki -Jagat and Kakani -Panchmane \nareas, north of the Kathmandu valley. About 100 anomalies were identified during these \nreconnaissance surveys. Based on this work, a follow -up ground radiometr ic survey covering \nabout 1 200 km² was carried out between the Kamala River and Narayani River from 1988 to 1990. \nMineralisation was observed in the Tinbhangale area of Makawanpur district, where uranium \ngrades of up to 0.13% U were recorded.  \nFrom 1992 to 1994, preliminary and follow -up ground radiometric exploration was carried \nout over part of the Baitadi, Bajhang and Darchula districts. Exploration covering an area of about 150 km² was conducted between the Mahakali River and the Jamari Gad area of the B aitadi \nand Darchula districts. Uranium contents of up to 0.92% U were observed in bedrock and float.  \nBy 2011, the DMG had identified 24 uranium occurrences in Nepal, mainly within the Siwalik \nsandstone, and in quartzites and pegmatites/granites. A sub econo mic uranium occurrence was \nidentified at the Tinbhangale (Makawanpur) locality estimated at 35 tU. From 2012 to 2015, uranium and thorium exploration, sponsored by a Technical Cooperation project between the DMG and the International Atomic Energy Agency, was completed in this area.  \nFrom 2014 to 2015, prospecting was completed in the Bangabagar -Baggoth and Gorang areas \nof the Baitadi district. And from 2016 to 2017, U and Th exploration and radiation hazard mapping was completed in the Shivpuri area near Kathmandu.  \nFrom 2014 to 2017, radioactivity anomalies were identified in sandstones in the Lomangthang \narea of the Upper Mustang region. Additional IAEA/DMG -sponsored prospectivity mapping was \ndelayed due to challenges with accessing this remote area.  \nUran ium potential in sandstones (tabular sandstone and roll -front sandstone type) \nThere is potential for Nepal to host economic uranium deposits, and the most promising targets \nare sandstone -type deposits. However, the challenges associated with access, remoteness, \nenvironmental concerns and protected areas are significant.  \nSmall and irregular uranium mineralisation showings have been discovered in the upper parts \nof the Middle Siwalik and the basal part of the Upper Siwalik Formations in Central Nepal. Coarse -\ngrained sandstones that may have high permeability, and the presence of reductants, are favourable for the occurrence of sandstone -type uranium deposits. The Siwalik Group was \n                                                      \n*  Report prepared by the NEA/IAEA, based on IAEA Technical Cooperation Project reports.  \nNATIONAL REPORTS: NEPAL  \n384 URA NIUM 202 2: RESOURCES, PRODUCTION AND DEMAND, NEA No. 7634, © OECD 202 3 deposited from the Mid -Miocene to the Lower Pleistocene. The Group is composed of shale, \nclaystone, mudstone, sandstone and conglomerates, mainly of fluviatile origin. Plants, as well as \ninvertebrate and vertebrate fossils and coalified plant remains (fossil wood, lignite layers, etc.) are \ncommon. The Palung two -mica peraluminous gran ite complex located to the north of the \nmineralised areas may have represented a major uranium source for these deposits. The uranium \nis associated with coal material in gritty to pebbly arkosic sandstone. The mineralised sections are \n1-5 m in thickness an d 500 m long at the Tinbhangale loc ality. Uranium contents from \n10-1 308 ppm (0.001- 0.13% U) have been measured in chip and channel samples. Uranium \nminerals are tyuyamunite in the oxidised zone and uraninite and coffinite in the unoxidised zone.  \nFrom 2014 to 2017, exploration in the remote Lomangthang area, Upper Mustang region, \nidentified an extensive area (10 km x 3 km) of anomalous radioactivity, possibly associated with \ntabular or roll- front sandstone -type deposits. The radioactivity occurs within you ng (8 -2 Ma), \npoorly consolidated interbedded sandstones and siltstones that occur close to U -rich granite \nsource rocks. The sandstones also appear to contain organic material that could act as reductants for uranium deposition.  \nUranium potential related t o sodium metasomatism (Na -Metasomatite Type)  \nIn 1982, a radioactivity showing (>3 000 cps) a few hundred metres above the Main Central Thrust was identified along the Chhuling Khola River. The mineralisation is represented by brannerite disseminated in an albitised rock. These features are typical of uranium deposits associated with Na metasomatism which may present large uranium resources.  \nThis “Gorkha radioactivity occurrence” is associated with a large (~10 km by ~2  km) saprolite -\nweathered nepheline sye nite body. Scintillometer radioactivity (>5  000 cps BGS -1SL) was \ndiscovered during a regional scale field -mapping programme conducted by the DMG. Subsequent \nspectrometer surveys identified up to ~475 ppm eU and up to ~730 ppm eTh at the locality. The nephe line syenite body has high background radioactivity throughout and is well foliated \n(schistose to gneissic). The surface of the body and edge/contact with phyllites/country rocks are associated with anomalous radioactivity and appear to be important explor ation targets. \nA saprolite -weathered nepheline syenite body has anomalous radioactivity relative to the \nbackground. Weathered material is not competent (no longer considered rock) and it is verging on becoming soil. “Fresh” (weak to no alteration) nephelin e syenite also appears to be associated with \nanomalous radioactivity. New road cuts and roadwork helped uncover new rocks and outcrops.  \nAltered nepheline syenite rock has anomalous radioactivity relative to the background. The \nhighest radioactivity observ ed was in altered nepheline syenite  coincident with fractures \n(>20 times that of “normal” syenite). If the entire radioactivity is attributed to uranium, one \nfractured sample would have 900 -1 000 ppm eU. Radioactive fractures are magnetic and \nassociated with iron oxides and hydroxides (magnetite ± hematite ± limonite). Near this fracturing, the nepheline syenite is altered, but still competent and un -weathered. Albite/feldspars are \nconverted to white clays and sericite (saussuritisation). Mafic minerals ± n epheline have been \nconverted to chlorite. This is not interpreted to represent a low -temperature alteration system \nand is most likely the result of hydrothermal alteration processes. Field observations suggest that either a metasomatite or granite -hosted u ranium deposit model may be valid for the Gorkha \nradioactive occurrence.  \nUranium potential of the Banku quartzite (“vein type”)  \nUraninite and autunite mineralisation has been discovered in outcrops over the Banku quartzite in West Nepal over 1 500 m and wi th a thickness of 1.5 -8 m. Uranium oxides occurring in \nmillimetre thick veinlets indicate the presence of a hydrothermal system that was able to leach and concentrate uranium in the form of uranium oxide. Surface radiometry has yielded total counts of 3 50 0-10 000 cps (GAD 6 scintillometer). Outcrop sample analyses have given uranium \ncontents of 137 -9 213 ppm U (0.04 -0.9% U). This area is considered as prospective for the \ndiscovery of “vein -type” uranium mineralisation associated with quartzites.  \nNATIONA L REPORTS: NEPAL  \nURANIUM 202 2: RESOURCES, PRODUCTION AND DEMAND, NEA No. 7634, ©  OECD 20 23 385 Uranium po tential from unconventional resources (phosphate, lignite -coal, black shale types)  \nThe most important phosphate occurrence in Nepal has been identified in the Baitadi carbonate \nformation in the Lesser Himalaya of Far East Nepal, of the middle Proterozoic a ge (1 200 to \n1 000 Ma). The phosphate -rich horizon is confined in the stromatolitic Massive Cherty Dolomite \nmember among seven lithological members. It extends laterally over more than 25 km. Its thickness varies from a few metres to 18  m. The P\n2O5 content varies from 10 to 32 wt.%. To evaluate \nthe economic potential of the Baitadi Formation, it would be necessary to identify the average \nphosphate content.  \nIn Nepal, coal occurs in four stratigraphic horizons: Quaternary lignite of the Kathmandu \nvalley, Siwalik coal of the Sub Himalayan/Churia Range, Eocene coal of western and mid -\nwestern Nepal, and Gondwana coal. The uranium content of these horizons is unknown. The \nuranium content of the lignite horizon from the Kathmandu valley may have significant \nuranium  contents owing to the presence of uranium showings in the gneissic muscovite -\ntourmaline granites and pegmatites occurring to the north of Kathmandu city, with drainage \ndirected to the Kathmandu valley. Only the Quaternary lignite of the Kathmandu valley and the \nEocene coal has been mined for domestic needs. The resources from the Quaternary lignite and \nthe Eocene are quite limited and even if they were relatively rich in uranium, their recovery will not be of economic interest. However, due to the presence of uranium -rich othogneisses \nsurrounding the Kathmandu depression, it is likely that these lignites are significantly enriched \nin uranium. As they are also used for domestic needs, they may also represent an environmental \nconcern that could be evaluated.  \nBlack shales also occur in various parts of Nepal, but they are generally metamorphosed and \ndeformed, and their uranium content is not known. Therefore, the probability of having significant uranium resources in this type of lithology seems to be limited g iven the present \nstate of knowledge.  \nRecent and ongoing uranium exploration and mine development activities  \nNepal is currently building its capacity to explore for uranium deposits and to analyse geological samples for U and Th. The IAEA continues to support Nepal through national and inter -regional \ntechnical co -operation projects on uranium exploration and production (2016 -2023). These \nprojects support national capacity building for the exploration and mining of U and Th resources, with a focus on training , equipment procurement and technology transfer. Priority exploration \ntargets include the Tinbhangale and Upper Mustang Lomanthang sandstone -type uranium \noccurrences.  \nIdentified conventional resources (reasonably assured and inferred resources)  \nNepal has no known uranium resources.  \nUndiscovered conventional resources (prognosticated and speculative resources)  \nResources are roughly estimated at 35 tU at Tinbhangale in the Siwalik region.  \nUnconventional resources and other materials  \nNo unconventional resour ces have been identified.   \nUranium production  \nHistorical review  \nNo uranium production has occurred.  \nNATIONAL REPORTS: NEPAL  \n386 URA NIUM 202 2: RESOURCES, PRODUCTION AND DEMAND, NEA No. 7634, © OECD 202 3 Status of production facilities, production capability, recent and ongoing activities and \nother issues  \nNo uranium production is planned  \nNational policies re lating to uranium  \nThe regulations of the Mines and Mineral Act  guide the exploration of all minerals in Nepal. \nUranium along with rare earth elements are treated as strategic minerals and exploration \nactivity is conducted exclusively by the DMG.

The French Atomic Energy Commission initiated \nfurther studies of the sandstone, which were taken over by the Compagnie Générale des \nMatières Nucléai res (COGEMA) and resulted in the discoveries of Abokurum (1959), Madaouela \n(1963), Arlette, Ariege, Artois and Taza (1965), Imouraren (1966) and Akouta (1967).  \nThe Société des Mines de l’Aïr  (Somaïr) was created in 1968 and started production from the \nArlette deposit in 1971 by shallow (60 m depth) open -pit mining. From 1971 to 1988, acid heap \nleaching was used at Arlit, producing 200 -600 tU/yr, for a total of 5 900 tU over this 17- year period. \nThe uranium recovery rate achieved was low (50% or less) and f rom 1988 to 2009 more than \n10 Mt of low -grade ore (0.08% U average grade) had been stockpiled. In 2009, after conducting \ntests over several years, Somaïr restarted heap leaching using an improved process to achieve recovery rates above 85%. Since the start  of operations in 1971, about 70 000 tU were produced \nat the Somaïr mine. In 2017, due to tough uranium market conditions, Somaïr entered a plan to \nreduce annual production to 1 700 tU.  \nThe Compagnie Minière d’Akouta (Cominak) was set up in 1974 and started production from \nthe Akouta and Akola deposits, near the town of Akokan. This is an underground operation at a depth of about 250 m. Production has now switched to the deposit of Ebba/Afasto, south of Akouta and Akola. Since the start of operations in 197 8, more than 70 000 tU were produced at \nCominak mine.  \nIn 2004, COGEMA and the government of Niger signed an agreement to undertake a major \nexploration programme. In subsequent years, both Somaïr and Cominak were involved in exploration solely for the purpose of better evaluating previously discovered deposits. Somaïr \ndelineated the Taza Nord deposit, while Cominak evaluated a mineralised area south -east of \nthe Akola deposit.  \nDevelopment of the large Imouraren deposit about 80 km south of Arlit was confirmed  in \nJanuary 2008. In 2009, Areva SA (now Orano SA, as of January 2018) was awarded a mining licence and a joint venture agreement was signed to develop Imouraren, but it was shelved because of unfavourable market conditions.  \nIn 2006, the China National Nuc lear Corporation (CNNC) signed an agreement to develop the \nAzelik -Abokurum deposit and a new company, Société des Mines d’Azelik (Somina), was created \nin 2007 for this purpose. About 670 tU were produced up to 2014, when the mine was put in care and mainte nance.  \nAll uranium deposits in Niger are located within the Tim Mersoï Basin, a sub -basin of the \nIllemmenden Basin. The Tim Mersoï Basin is close to the main Arlit -In Azaoua fault. Uranium \nis mined close to the twin mining towns of Arlit and Akokan, 900 km  north -east of the capital, \nNiamey (more than 1  200 km by road), near the southern border of the Sahara Desert and the \n                                                      \n*  Report prepared by the NEA/IAEA, based on company reports and government data.  \nNATIONAL REPORTS: NIGER  \n388 URA NIUM 202 2: RESOURCES, PRODUCTION AND DEMAND, NEA No. 7634, © OECD 202 3 western range of the Aïr Mountains. The concentrates are trucked to ports in Benin and the \nmajority are exported to the Malvési conversion facility in France.  \nUranium exploration in Niger was revitalised in 2007 as the price of uranium increased. Six \nnew exploration permits were granted that year and by 2011 uranium exploration activities were \nbeing carried out on 160 concessions by foreig n companies. From 2001 to 2016, 356 uranium \nexploration permits were registered. However, since 2011, there have been increasing geopolitical \ntensions in the region, resulting in foreign companies like Paladin and URU Metals ceasing \nexploration activities in Niger.  \nFollowing a 2006 agreement in which Areva agreed to increase royalty payments to the \ngovernment by 50%, development of the Imouraren deposit, about 80 km south of Arlit and 160  km \nnorth of Agadez, was announced in January 2008. In January 2009, Areva was awarded a mining licence. The Imouraren SA mining company was established, with Areva NC Expansion (86.5% \nAreva, 13.5% KEPCO) holding a 66.65% interest and Sopamin of Niger holding the remaining 33.35% . \nProduction was expected to be 5 000 tU/yr f or 35  years. The deposit covers 8 km by 2.5  km. Orano \nreports 213 722 tU of probable reserves at 0.072%  U plus 62 584 tU of indicated and 2 879 tU of \ninferred resources. Average depth is 110 m and maximum thickness 60  m. At full production, \nthe project’s h eap leaching facility will process 20 000 tonnes of ore per day with an expected \n85% rate of recovery. Excavation of the first pit started in mid -2012. In May 2014, uranium prices \nwere not sufficient to allow profitable mining of the deposit and the Nigerien government and \nAreva agreed to suspend development and set up a joint strategic committee that will determine \nwhen mining should start.  \nIn 2008, GoviEx Uranium held two exploration properties of 2 300 km\n2: one near the Arlit \nmine, including the Madaoue la deposit, as well as 2  000 km2 near Agadez. In August 2008, \nCameco bought an 11% share in the company for USD 28 million, with an option to increase its \nshare to 48%. The government of Niger has the right to hold a 10% carried interest and the option \nto purchase a further 30% share when the Nigerien mining company is incorporated. The GoviEx \ndrilling programme commenced in August 2008. The work programme was based on three \nobjectives: i) resource delineation drilling of Marianne and Marilyn deposits; ii) exploration and \nresource definition drilling on the Madaouela South deposit area; and iii) exploratory drilling \nbetween the known deposits. As of February 2010, a project -wide total of 584 000 m had been \ndrilled by GoviEx.  \nGlobal Atomic Fuels Corp. (GAFC), a private Canadian company, has six exploration permits \n(728.8 km2) located in the north of Agadez, four at Tin Negouran (the “TN permits”) and two at \nAdrar Emoles (the “AE permits”). The Adrar Emoles permit hosts the Dasa deposit, a sandstone basal -channel type deposit. From 2010 to 2014, GAFC drilled 969 holes (867 rotary drill holes and \n102 diamond drill holes), for a total of >120  000 m and in January 2014 released an initial inferred \nresource estimate, which totalled 43 850 tU grading 0.054% U, using an 0.0085% U cut -off. In June \n2014, GAFC announced internal resource estimates ranging from 64 600 tU at 0.049% U (0.0085% U \ncut-off), to 29  600 tU grading 0.29% U (0.127% U cut -off). The base case appeared to be 36 500 tU \ngrading at 0.222%  U (0.085%  U cu t-off).  \nURU Metals Limited reported a South African Mineral Resource Committee (SAMREC) \ncompliant inferred resource of 1 654 tU on their In Gall deposit and in 2011 continued to drill the \nAboye, Akenzigui and Fagochia targets within their Irhazer and In G all permits. Project \ncommitments elsewhere caused URU Metals to take steps to terminate activities in Niger by 2014.  \nIn December 2010, Paladin completed the takeover of NGM Resources Ltd, the owner of the \nlocal company Indo Energy Ltd that held concession s in the Agadez region. NGM Resources had \nannounced an inferred mineral resource of 4 320 tU. In early 2011, Paladin carried out a drilling \nprogramme that further defined targets for follow -up and information from the drilling was \nused to plan a 15  000 m drilling campaign. However, this was put on hold because of security \nconcerns. All fieldwork has ceased and force majeure  was requested from the government \nauthorities for an indefinite suspension of further expenditures.  \nIn 2011, GazPromBank Niger Mineral s SARL, a Russian company, was granted two uranium \nlicences (Toulouk) located in the Tim Mersoï Basin. In March 2017, the company submitted a pre-feasibility study through which it declared JORC compliant inferred resources of sandstone -\ntype tabular mineralisation with 29  630 tU at a grade of 0.0157%, a roll -front type deposit \nNATIONAL REPORTS: NIGER  \nURANIUM 202 2: RESOURCES, PRODUCTION AND DEMAND, NEA No. 7634, ©  OECD 20 23 389 containing 17  000 tU with grades varying from 0.04% to 0.06% and a surficial sandstone- type \ndeposit containing 8 237 tU at a grade of 0.0252% U.  \nOn 20 September 2013, Pan African Min erals Ltd was granted four uranium licences \n(Ouricha  1 and 2 and Tegmert 1 and 2) located in the Agadez area. Pan African Minerals planned \nto invest at least USD 20 million in exploration activities during the next three years.  \nRecent and ongoing uranium exploration and mine development activities  \nDasa project  \nIn 2017- 2018, Global Atomic Corporation (GAC; formerly GAFC) commenced a new drilling \nprogramme targeting various areas of the Dasa project and a total of 59 holes amounting to \n26 479 m were complet ed. This delineated higher -grade mineralisation within 300  m of the \nsurface. The drilling was focused on areas of faulting associated with a graben structure and results improved understanding of the distribution of mineralisation within the deposit and \nconfidence in the geological model. This resulted in an upgraded classification of resources from \ninferred to indicated  \nThe Dasa project mineral resources were first estimated and reported by CSA Global in April \n2017, then updated in June 2018 and June 2019.  Mineral resources were reported in two parts; \nthose that have potential for extraction by open pit, and the deeper, higher -grade material \noutside of the open pit that may be amenable to underground mining. The open- pit mineral \nresources are the parts of t he deposit above a cut -off of 320  ppm eU\n3O8. Higher -grade material \nabove a cut -off grade of 1  200 ppm eU 3O8 outside of the optimised pit shell was considered for \nunderground mining.

GAC planned to use conventional underground mining and proven processin g technology that is \ncurrently being used at existing uranium mines in Niger, target ing an initial production of \n44 Mlb (16  900 tU) with an average processed grade of 0.46 %U. The PEA cash costs amounted \nUSD 16.72/lb U\n3O8 (USD 43.47/kgU), including corpora te and all other off -site costs, and an all -in \nsustaining cost of USD 18.39/lb U 3O8 (USD  47.81/kgU).  \nAn environmental impact statement (EIS) was completed and filed with the Niger \ngovernment in July 2020. The Dasa project site hydrogeology drilling and wat er flow test work \nwas completed and a tender for final geotechnical diamond drilling for the feasibility study was \nissued. Two public hearings in Niger regarding the EIS were organised, one in the Dasa project \narea and the other in the capital city of Niam ey. \nIn August 2020, pilot plant trils were initiated in the process research Ortech facility in Canada \nto confirm and optimise the processing plant flow sheet. The tests demonstrated the viability of \nthe uranium recovery process detailed in the May 2020 PEA.  \nNATIONAL REPORTS: NIGER  \n390 URA NIUM 202 2: RESOURCES, PRODUCTION AND DEMAND, NEA No. 7634, © OECD 202 3 On 25 September 2020, GAC announced that it had applied for a mining permit for the Dasa \nproject. In December 2020, a presidential decree granting the mining permit was approved by the \nCouncil of Ministers for the project. GAC also received  three -year permit extensions  for each of its \nsix exploration properties in Niger. These include the Adrar Emoles 3 permit hosting the Dasa and \nDajy (6  540 tU) deposits, the Adrar Emoles 4 permit, hosting the Isakanan deposit (13  080 tU) and \nthe Tin Negouran 1, 2, 3 a nd 4 permits, hosting the Tin Negouran deposit (3  850 tU). \nIn November 2021, GAC issued an NI 43- 101 compliant, Phase 1 Dasa project feasibility study \n(FS). It confirmed that the project is economically compelling at a price of USD 35/lb U 3O8 \n(USD  91/kgU).  Based on the FS, the Board of Directors made a decision to proceed with production \nat the Dasa project. The FS is focused solely on Phase 1, primarily comprised of the flank zone, and represents the initial 12 years of the project and less than 20% of the  Dasa mineralisation.

The Dajy deposit is located along the major northeast -southwest trending Azouza \nFault that hosts the Azelik and Dasa deposits, some 30  km SE of Imouraren. Whereas Dasa can \nbe traced to the surface, Dajy occurs at depth. Dajy uranium mineralisation is h osted in three \nsandstone units over a 3.5  km long and 400  m wide area. The Dajy deposit contains 6 540 tU \ngrading 0.0584% U (inferred resources). The Isakanan deposit, located 15 km south of the Dasa \nand Dajy deposits, hosts 13  080 tU grading 0.076%  U (inf erred resources). The Tin Negouran \npermits host the Tagadamat deposit, where mineralisation occurs within surface paleochannels \nalong a 3 -km strike, with potential for open -pit mining and heap leach processing. The \nTagadamat deposit hosts 3  850 tU grading 0.015%  U (inferred resources). An environmental \nbaseline study was completed in 2009, but the project was put on hold until 2020.  \nMadaouela project  \nIn March 2017, GoviEx began a drilling programme focused on expanding shallow near -surface \nuranium minerali sation associated with the Miriam deposit. The 4  000 m drilling programme was \nconducted on a 100  m grid at Madaouela to an expected average depth of approximately 100  m \n(40 drill holes). However, the drilling did not result in additional resources. On 15 N ovember 2017, \nGoviEx was granted an exploration permit for Agaliouk, which is adjacent to the Madaouela \ndeposit. The Agaliouk exploration permit adds 4  488 tU in the measured and indicated categories \nand 3  596 tU in the inferred category.  \nGoviEx developed  a NI 43- 101 integrated development plan for five deposits (Marianne, \nMarilyn, Miriam, Madaouela South North East [MSNE] and Maryvonne). The plan is based on \ndetailed pre -feasibility geological studies that considered metallurgical testing and processing \noptions, mine design, infrastructure, rock mechanics, tailings and heap leach and hydrogeological \nand environmental impacts. As of November 2017, NI 43- 101 compliant resources at Madaouela \ntotalled 42 603 tU of measured and indicated resources and 10 647 tU of inferred resources. An \nopen -pit mine on at least part of the deposit, followed by underground room and pillar mining \nwith conventional processing, is expected to produce 1  030 tU/yr over 21 years, with potential for \nNATIONAL REPORTS: NIGER  \nURANIUM 202 2: RESOURCES, PRODUCTION AND DEMAND, NEA No. 7634, ©  OECD 20 23 391 expanding the resource.

Recoverable \nreasonabl y assured resources (RAR) amount to 334  816 tU; inferred recoverable resources total \n133 232 tU. The increase of total recoverable resources (28 660 tU) is mainly associated with an \nincrease of resources at the Dasa and Somaïr deposits. Mining depletion in  2019 and 2020 \namounted to 5  973 tU and is taken into consideration in the resource figures.  \nIn the <USD 130/kgU cost category, recoverable RAR amount to 257  520 tU (77% of total RAR), \ninferred recoverable resources to 53 600 tU (40% of total inferred res ources).  \nAll uranium deposits in Niger are sandstone -hosted, with average grades of 0.07 to 0.40% U, \nwith 72% of total identified resources in the RAR category and 95% of these are amenable to \nopen -pit mining.  \nUndiscovered conventional resources (prognost icated and speculative resources)  \nTotal speculative and prognosticated resources in Niger, as of 1 January 2021, amounted to \n64 900 tU (unchanged from 2017).  \nUranium production  \nHistorical review  \nUranium has been produced from sandstone deposits in Niger  since 1971 by Somaïr at the Arlit \nmine, since 1978 by Cominak at the Akouta mine and since 2010 by Somina at the Azelik mine.  \nThe Société des Mines d’Azelik  SA (Somina) was established in 2007 to mine the Azelik/ \nTeguidda deposits. Azelik was developed b y the China National Nuclear Corporation (CNNC) \nand came into production at the end of 2010, with the aim of ramping up to 700  tU/yr. It is an \nopen -pit and underground operation using alkaline leach. In August 2014, CNNC announced \nthat Azelik had experienc ed prolonged project delays, overruns in its construction budget, and \nlow production. In February 2015, CNNC announced that the mine would be closed and put in \ncare and maintenance because of “tight cash flow”.  \nNATIONAL REPORTS: NIGER  \n394 URA NIUM 202 2: RESOURCES, PRODUCTION AND DEMAND, NEA No. 7634, © OECD 202 3 Somaïr and Cominak were licensed to the end of 2013, and in mid -December 2013, both \nwere shut down for maintenance, pending resolution of negotiations on licence renewals. The \nmines resumed operation at the end of January 2014 under the terms of a government decree. \nIn May 2014, the government and Ar eva signed a new five- year agreement for the two mines \nbased on the 2006 mining law and expressing what both sides said was a balanced partnership.  \nIn 2015, production recorded for Niger amounted to 4 116 tU, then decreased to 3  478 tU in \n2016, 3 484 tU i n 2017 and 2  878 tU in 2018, then increasing slightly to 2 982 in 2019 and 2 991 tU \nin 2020.  \nStatus of production facilities, production capability, recent and ongoing activities and \nother issues  \nProduction in 2019 amounted to 2 982 tU, 1 912 tU of which  was produced by Somaïr at the Arlit \nopen -pit mine and 1  070 tU by Cominak at the Akouta undergound mine. Production in 2020 \namounted to 2 991 tU, of which 1 879 tU was produced by Somaïr and 1 112 tU by Cominak. It is \nexpected that U production in 2021 wi ll decrease by about 25% due to Akouta mine shutdown.  \nOn 24 October 2019, Orano announced that Cominak will end its uranium production on \n31 March  2021 due to the exhaustion of ore and high operating costs, and on that date the \nAkouta mine ceased production after nearly 50 years of service. Since 1978, Cominak has mined \nthe Akouta, Akola and Ebba deposits, producing approximately 75 000 tU from 1978 to the end of 2020.  \nProduction at the Somaïr (Arlit) open -pit mine has been lowered by 30% since 2015 due to  \nweak market conditions. Arlit is expected to continue operating for some time, as additional \nresources have been added to the project over the last few years that should extend its mine \nlife to the late 2020s. In December 2018, the Nigerien government and  Orano negotiated and \napproved a new five -year agreement (2019- 2023) for the Cominak and Somaïr mines.  \nOn 25 September 2020, GAC submitted a mining permit application for the Dasa project and \nin December 2020 a presidential decree granting the mining perm it was approved by the Council \nof Ministers. GAC has also received  three -year permit extensions  for each of its six exploration \nproperties in Niger. These include the Adrar Emoles 3 permit hosting the Dasa and Dajy deposits, \nthe Adrar Emoles 4 permit hosti ng the Isakanan deposit, and the Tin Negouran 1, 2, 3 and 4 \npermits hosting the Tin Negouran deposit.  \nOn 19 July 2019, GoviEx announced that it had finalised agreements with Niger that stipulate \ncommercial terms to progress the Madaouela project. Under the  terms of these agreements, a \nNigerien operating company named Compagnie Minière Madaouela SA (“COMIMA”) was \nincorporated by GoviEx into which the Madaouela mining permit is to be transferred.

It is reported that 99% of the workers at these two mines are Nigerien. About 680 workers \nwere employed at the Azelik m ine, but due to the cessation of mining operations, only 25  workers \nhave been retained. The Imouraren project employed about 300  during the development stage and \nis expected to create about 1 400 permanent and up to 3 000 indirect jobs when the facility wi ll be \nin full production.  \nEmployment in the uranium industry is not available for 2019 and 2020. In the near future, \nemployment in Niger could increase with the development of new mines at Dasa and Madouela. At Cominak, following the closure of mining act ivities, part of the workforce will be kept to \noversee remediation of the site.  \nFuture production centres  \nIn May 2009, development of the Imouraren mine was launched with an initial investment of \nmore than USD 1.9 billion. Once ramped -up to full capacity,  production of 5 000 tU/yr for \n35 years is expected. Production, originally scheduled to start mid -2015, remains delayed owing \nto poor market conditions.  \nGoviEx has completed a PFS and proposed an open -pit/ underground mine development for \nthe Madaouela p roject, which could go into production after 2022 with a capacity to produce \n950 tU/yr at the beginning and plans to reach 5  000 tU/yr when fully operational.  \nGAC plans to construct its first mine at Dasa, targeting annual capacity of 1 400 tU/yr. In \nNove mber 2021, GAC started with site infrastructure development, including road upgrades to \nconnect the mine camp to the main highway, new roads to the mine and mill sites. The portal \narea has been cleared for excavation to begin in January 2022.  \nEnvironmental  activities and socio- cultural issues  \nBoth mining operations at Somaïr and Cominak have maintained their ISO 14001 certification \nfor environmental management for many years (certification is renewed every three years). \nAreva maintains that environmental i ssues, including water preservation, is fundamentally \nimportant to their operations. The mandate of the AMAN project, established in 2004, is to study \nthe existing aquifers in the Arlit and Akokan areas to ensure an adequate supply of potable and \nindustria l water is available and not being compromised. Ways to conserve and reduce water \nconsumption have been implemented and over the past 15 years the annual consumption of \nwater at the mines has been reduced by 35%, despite uranium production doubling at Soma ïr \nin the past 10 years.  \nIn April 2010, Areva and local authorities signed a series of protocols and procedures to \nimplement multipartite radiological control of materials and equipment in the streets of Arlit \nand Akokan, including more stringent monitoring of used materials being taken from the \nindustrial sites.  \nSomaïr and Cominak manage two hospitals in Arlit and Akokan with technical support \ncentres. First created to provide medical care for the miners and their families, the centres are \nnow largely op en to the public free of charge. Imouraren also recently opened a medical centre \nthat treats local residents for free.  \nAs the country’s largest private employer, Orano has been contributing to the improvement \nof living conditions in local communities. In 2010, Orano (then Areva) initiated a social policy \nand committed EUR 6 million per year (about USD 6.5 million) for the next five years for implementation. Mining activity has resulted in the construction of housing and a modern \nnetwork of water distributi on as well as contributing to the funding of public services and the \nconstruction of educational facilities (schools, libraries, lunchrooms, etc.).  \nIn 2018, Orano invested EUR 2 million (about USD 2.2 million) in the Irhazer project in order \nto develop ir rigation systems and agricultural activities in desert areas in the Agadez region. \nThe objective of the project is to contribute to sustainable food safety against poverty.  \nNATIONAL REPORTS: NIGER  \nURANIUM 202 2: RESOURCES, PRODUCTION AND DEMAND, NEA No. 7634, ©  OECD 20 23 397 Studies for the remediation of the Cominak site began in 2002 with the collection o f \nenvironmental data to inform the closure planning process. The remediation plans have been \nregularly updated over the subsequent years to include the results of additional data and \ntechnical studies, in order to fully inform the possible closure options.  \nA remediation plan that includes technical, social and community components has been \ndefined in the Detailed Basic Design study to meet three major challenges:  \n• Technical: ensure lasting stability in terms of public health and safety, reduce as low as reasonably achievable (ALARA principles) the residual impacts as well as the surface area \nof land subject to use restrictions after the remediation.  \n• Employees: minimise the social impact of the closure of production activities and ensure fair and equitable t reatment of all employees.  \n• Community: take into consideration and minimise the impacts of the closure on the \ncommunity by ensuring a sustainable transition, adapted to the needs of the local \npopulations and in keeping with the company’s scope of responsib ility.  \nUranium requirements  \nThere are currently no uranium requirements in Niger. However, it has been reported that Niger has started consultations with the International Atomic Energy Agency and is considering the installation of two civilian nuclear re actors to meet domestic energy requirements and assist in \nnational economic development.  \nUranium policies, uranium stocks and uranium prices  \nNational policies relating to uranium  \nOne of the main objectives of Niger’s national uranium policy is to achiev e a higher degree of \ninternational competitiveness in the industry. In July 2011, President Issoufou stated that he \nwould seek a better price for the country’s uranium exports to maximise their value to support \neconomic and social development. About one -third of Niger’s export revenue comes from \nuranium.  \nIn May 2014, the Nigerien government and Areva signed a new five -year agreement for the \ntwo mines based on the 2006 mining law, in which the royalty rate will increase potentially to 12% of market value, d epending on profitability. The deal also stipulates for the first time that the firms’ \nboards will include Nigerien managing directors –  appointed in 2014 for Somaïr, and in 2016 for \nCominak. Also, Areva will provide EUR 90 million (USD 97 million) to supp ort construction of a \nroad from Tahoua to Arlit, near the uranium developments, as well as a further EUR 17 million (USD 18.4 million) for development in the surrounding Irhazer Valley. Orano will also build a new \nheadquarters building (Maison de l’uranium ) for its operating companies in the capital Niamey at \na cost of EUR 10 million (USD 11 million). The government expects more than USD 39 million in \nadditional tax revenues annually from the new Strategic Partnership Agreement. In October 2014, \nthe Nigerien government formally approved the agreement.  \nEach year’s production is sold to joint venture partners, usually in proportion to their equity, \nat a set transfer price known as “prix Niger”. The quantities not sold to joint venture partners, if any, are so ld to trading companies at the prevailing spot prices.  \nUranium prices  \nThe price of uranium sold to joint venture partners (prix Niger) is proposed by mining companies \nto the Ministry of Mines, which ultimately decides on its level and duration of validit y – usually \nequivalent to one year. This price is officially published in the National Gazette  (Journal Officiel de la \nRépublique du Niger ) and posted on its website. In case the price determination is made during the \nyear, it is retroactively applied to d eliveries already made .  \nNATIONAL REPORTS: NIGER  \n398 URA NIUM 202 2: RESOURCES, PRODUCTION AND DEMAND, NEA No. 7634, © OECD 202 3 Reasonably assured conventional resources by production method  \n(recoverable tonnes U)  \nProduction method  <USD 40/kgU  <USD 80/kgU  <USD 130/kgU  <USD 260/kgU  Recovery factor (%)  \nUnderground mining (UG)  0 78 13 680  35 279  81 \nOpen -pit mining (OP)  0  14 542  243 840  299 537  81 \nTotal  0 14 620  257 520  334 816  81 \nReasonably assured conventional resources by processing method  \n(recoverable tonnes U)  \nProcessing method  <USD 40/kgU  <USD 80/kgU  <USD 130/kgU  <USD 260/kgU  Recovery factor (%)  \nConventional from UG  0 78 13 680 35 279 81 \nConventional from OP  0 14 542  65 657 74 348 81 \nHeap leaching from OP  0 0 178 183 225 189 82 \nTotal  0 14 620  257 520 334 816 81 \nReasonably assured conventional resources by deposit type  \n(recoverab le tonnes U)  \nDeposit type  <USD 40/kgU  <USD 80/kgU  <USD 130/kgU  <USD 260/kgU  \nSandstone  0 14 620  257 520  334 816  \nTotal  0 14 620  257 520  334 816  \nInferred conventional resources by production method  \n(recoverable tonnes U)  \nProduction method  <US D 40/kgU  <USD 80/kgU  <USD 130/kgU  <USD 260/kgU  Recovery factor (%)  \nUnderground mining (UG)  0  0  0 17 870  74 \nOpen -pit mining (OP)  0  0  53 600  54 124  81 \nUnspecified  0 0  0 61 238  75  \nTotal  0 0 53 600  133 232  76 \nInferred conventional resource s by processing method  \n(recoverable tonnes U)  \nProcessing method  <USD 40/kgU  <USD 80/kgU  <USD 130/kgU  <USD 260/kgU  Recovery factor (%)  \nConventional from UG  0 0 0  17 870  74 \nConventional from OP  0 0 51 254  51 778  81 \nHeap leaching from OP  0 0 2 346  2 346  82 \nUnspecified  0 0 0 61 238  75 \nTotal  0 0 53 600  133 232  76 \nNATIONAL REPORTS: NIGER  \nURANIUM 202 2: RESOURCES, PRODUCTION AND DEMAND, NEA No. 7634, ©  OECD 20 23 399 Inferred conventional resources by deposit type  \n(recoverable tonnes U)  \nDeposit type  <USD 40/kgU  <USD 80/kgU  <USD 130/kgU  <USD 260/kgU  \nSandstone  0 0 53 600  133 232  \nTotal  0 0 53 600  133 232  \nPrognosticated conventional resources  \n(in situ tonnes U)  \nCost ranges  \n<USD 80/kgU  <USD 130/kgU  <USD 260/kgU  \n0 13 600  13 600  \nSpeculative conventional resources  \n(in situ tonnes U)  \nCost ranges  \n<USD 130/kgU  <USD 260/kgU  Unassigne d  \n0  51 300   0 \nHistorical uranium production by production method  \n(tonnes U in concentrates)   \nProduction method  Total through  \nend of 2018  2019 2020 Total through  \nend of 2020  2021  \n(expected)  \nOpen -pit mining*  72 780  1 912  1 879  76 571  2 000  \nUnd erground mining*  73 359 1 070  1 112  75 541  250  \nTotal  146 139  2 982  2 991  152 112  2 250 \n* Pre -2018 totals include uranium recovered by heap and in -place leaching.  \nHistorical uranium production by processing method  \n(tonnes U in concentrates)   \nProces sing method  Total through  \nend of 2018  2019 2020 Total through  \nend of 2020  2021 \n(expected)  \nConventional  NA  NA  NA  NA  NA  \nHeap leaching*  NA  NA  NA  NA  NA  \nTotal  146 139  2 982  2 991  152 112  2 250 \n* A subset of open -pit and underground mining, since it is used in conjunction with them.  \nNATIONAL REPORTS: NIGER  \n400 URA NIUM 202 2: RESOURCES, PRODUCTION AND DEMAND, NEA No. 7634, © OECD 202 3 Historical uranium production by deposit type  \n(tonnes U in concentrates)   \nDeposit type  Total through  \nend of 2018  2019 2020 Total through  \nend of 2020  2021 (expected)  \nSandstone  146 139  2 982  2 991  152 112  2 250 \nTotal  146 139  2 982  2 991  152 112  2 250 \nOwnership of uranium production in 2020  \nDomestic  Foreign  Totals  \nGovernment  Private  Government  Private  \n(tU)  (%)  (tU)  (%)  (tU)  (%)  (tU)  (%)  (tU)  (%) \n1 032  34.5  0  0  1 570  52.5  389  13.0  2 991  100 \nUranium industry employment at existing production centres  \n(person -years)  \n  2018  2019  2020  \nTotal employment related to existing production centres  3 011  NA NA \nEmployment directly related to uranium production  1 478  NA NA \n \nMid-term productio n projections (tonnes U/year ) \n2021  2022  2025  2030  2035  2040  \n2 250  2 000  3 400  NA NA NA \nMid-term production capability  \n(tonnes U/year)   \n2025  2030  \nA-I  B-I A-II B-II A-I B-I A-II B-II \n1 700  1 700  1 700  1 700  NA NA 1 700  4 100  \n \n2035  2040 \nA-I B-I A-II B-II A-I B-I A-II B-II \nNA NA 4 100  7 400  NA NA 7 400  7 400  \n \nNATIONAL REPORTS: PARAGUAY  \nURANIUM 202 2: RESOURCES, PRODUCTION AND DEMAND, NEA No. 7634, ©  OECD 20 23 401 Paraguay * \nUranium exploration and mine development  \nHistorical review  \nThe Anschutz Corporation (Anschutz) of Denver, Colorado, started exploration for uranium in \nsouth -eastern Paraguay in 1 976 after signing a Concession Agreement with the government of \nParaguay in December 1975. This agreement allowed Anschutz to explore for “all minerals, excluding oil, gas, and construction materials”.  \nPreviously intermittent exploration had been carried o ut by international oil companies, with \ninsignificant results. The region is known for its limited mining activities and production of high -\ngrade iron ore, mineral pigments, clays, limestone, sandstone, sand and gravel by I ndigenous \npeople.  \nIn early 1976,  several reports by Anschutz consultants A.F. Renfro, D.G. Bryant and G.E. \nThomas covered the geology of eastern Paraguay based on reconnaissance field trips made through the southern Precambrian area, the sedimentary section from north to south, and the alkalic intrusions in the north -central part of a large concession. From field examinations of \nvarious rock types and airborne radiometric data, it was concluded that the Anschutz Concession \ncontained areas with good potential for uranium mineralisation. Th e regional correlation of \nstratigraphic horizons favourable to uranium mineralisation was shown in that report.  \nThe initial uranium exploration by Anschutz in 1976 covered an exclusive exploration \nconcession of 162 700 km\n2, virtually the whole eastern half  of Paraguay. This included geological \nmapping, water sampling, soil sampling and a broad reconnaissance track etch programme, with \nstations spaced 10  km apart. The station spacing for the track etch survey was subsequently \nreduced to 5  km in the southern part of the concession. The reconnaissance programme outlined \nlarge anomalous zones and Anschutz concluded that the concession in Paraguay constituted a \nnew uranium province in an area underlain by granitic rocks and sandstones.  \nThe initial reconnaissance programme by Anschutz was followed by a programme of \nairborne radiometric and magnetic surveys, detailed track etch survey, with station spacing of 100 m to 200 m, geochemical stream sediment and soil sampling, and diamond drilling and rotary drilling over  selected target areas. In total, some 75 000 m of drilling was completed from \n1976 to 1983. Flight line spacing for the airborne radiometric survey was 5 km with a clearance \nof 100  m above the surface.  \nAnschutz carried out exploration on behalf of a join t venture with Korea Electric Power \nCorporation (K EPCO ) and Taiwan Power Company (Taiwan Power). Exploration works intersected \nuranium mineralisation in drill holes ranging from 0.017% eU (equivalent U) to 0.17% eU associated with layers of sub -horizontal sandstones, and higher -grade intersections ranging from 0.1% eU \nover 10.2 m to 0.3% eU over 0.3 m in sandstones and siltstones. Work was suspended in 1983 due \nto low uranium prices.  \n  \n                                                      \n*  Report prepared by the NEA/IAEA, based on previous Red Books, UNECE documents and company \nreports.  \nNATIONAL REPORTS: PARAGUAY  \n402 URA NIUM 202 2: RESOURCES, PRODUCTION AND DEMAND, NEA No. 7634, © OECD 202 3 Since 2011- 2012 the companies that have been working on uranium project s in Paraguay are \nUranium Energy Corporation (UEC) through its Paraguayan subsidiaries Transandes Paraguay S.A. \nand Piedra Rica Mining S.A., and UrAmerica Limited (UrAmerica) through joint ventures with Ita \nPora Mining S.A. and Minera Mbujapeju S.A.   \nIn Se ptember 2015, UEC requested a two -year suspension of activities due to low uranium \nprices. Because of this and other administration issues, there was no exploration activity until \n2019.  \nHistoric exploration by the Anschutz/Taiwan Power/K EPCO  joint venture  and by Cue \nResources, plus recent exploration by UEC, totalled investm ents worth approximately \nUSD  50 million.  \nIn conclusion, all known uranium occurrences in the country are found in the eastern part of \nthe country, and most of them are situated in the s andstones in the western flank of the Parana \nBasin. The age of most major sandstone uranium deposits ranges from Paleozoic to Mesozoic .  \nIn south -eastern Paraguay there is one uranium deposit close to the town of Yuty, and \ndrilling indicates elongated, ura nium -bearing roll fronts. At least one other area with good \npotential to become a new uranium district, located north -east of the city of Coronel Oviedo, is \nunder investigation.  \nAdditional uranium potential in eastern Paraguay is also likely to exist in U pper Permian \nsandstone near the town of Curuguaty and within Silurian sandstone sequences east of the \nvillage of Eusebio Ayala.  \nRecent and ongoing uranium exploration and mining development activities  \nIn the 2019- 2021 period, exploration activities were fo cused on the Coronel Oviedo area. Several \nradon emmanometry surveys and drilling exploration totalling approximately 1  000 m were \ncarried out. Total operating expenditures for the whole period are estimated at USD 750 000.  \nUranium resources  \nIdentified con ventional resources (reasonably assured and inferred resources)  \nUEC has reported about 4 290 in situ tU conventional resources, as regulated by Canadian Securities Administrators (CSA) National Instrument 43 -101, from the Yuty Project. These are \nmade of re asonably assured resources worth 3 430 tU at a grade of 0.044% U, and inferred \nresources worth 860 tU at a grade of 0.04% U.  \nThe resource estimate is based on the development of a three dimensional geologic and \nresource model, using mainly the results of 256 drill holes totalling 31 000 metres of core and \nrotary drilling carried out between 2007 and 2011. Additionally, some 75 000 metres of drilling \nhad been completed from 1976 to 1983.  \nPumping testing indicates that the uranium- bearing unit has aquifer ch aracteristics that \nwould support operational rates for ISL mining and that the aquifer properties determined from \nthe test fall within the range of values determined at other uranium ISL projects located in the \nUnited States in situ recovery (ISR) province s. Metallurgical test work indicates that a \nsatisfactory rate of extraction can be obtained using a sulphuric acid lixiviant.  \nAdjacent to Yuty, UrAmerica owns the Parana Basin Project, an extensive area of uranium \nmineralisation with several detected urani um anomalies and inferred resources of 770 tU. This \nestimate is based on extensive regional exploration work and reconnaissance scale drilling by \nUrAmerica’s predecessor, Wildhorse Explorations S.A., the Paraguayan branch of Wildhorse \nEnergy Ltd.  \nUpdated i n situ uranium identified resources total 5 060 tU in the production cost category \n<USD 130/kg.  \nNATIONAL REPORTS: PARAGUAY  \nURANIUM 202 2: RESOURCES, PRODUCTION AND DEMAND, NEA No. 7634, ©  OECD 20 23 403 Undiscovered conventional resources (prognosticated and speculative)  \nUEC has reported an NI 43 -101 exploration target at Coronel Oviedo ranging from 8  900 to 21  500 tU \nat grades between 0.034 and 0.044% U, which can be categorised as prognosticated resources.  \nEstimates are based on a 10 000- metre drilling programme completed by UEC in 2012. A total \nof 35 holes were drilled, averaging 290 metres in depth.  \nAquife r testing to date indicates that the uranium -bearing  unit has aquifer characteristics \nthat would support operational rates for ISL mining and that the aquifer properties determined \nfrom the test fall within the range of values determined at other uranium I SL projects located \nin Wyoming, Texas and Nebraska.

Rhyolites lack ash f low petrographic features and were erupted as crystal -charged frothy \ndebris -flows, with the absence of explosive degassing permitting the exceptional retention of ore \nmetals.  \nBackground (whole rock) uranium contents of the younger lava flows average 28  ppm  U \n(0.003% U) and attain 120 ppm  U (0.012% U) and 270 ppm  U (0.027% U) in coeval hypabyssal \nintrusions and residual glasses (obsidian), respectively.  \nConsidering all the surveyed areas, Chapi was selected as the most important site, and \ndetailed radiometry , emanometry, trenching and gallery work, as well as diamond drilling, were \ncarried out. The mineralisation is in sub -vertical fractures distributed in structural lineaments \nfrom 15 m  to 150 m in width and 20  m to 30  m in thickness. Grades vary between 0.03%  U and \n0.75%  U, with an average of 0.1%  U. Therefore, based on the available geological and exploration \nresults, a minimum potential of 10  000 tU was assigned to the Chapi site and 30  000 tU to the \nwhole Macusani uraniferous district.  \nSince 2003, private  companies restarted exploration in both the Macusani district and the \nSanta Lucia- Rio Blanco and Pampacolca areas (250  km from Macusani near Arequipa, in the south \nof Peru), which are also located in a Tertiary volcanic environment. In addition, the Peruvian \nNuclear Energy Institute (IPEN), through its promotional activities, proposed highlighting new \nareas of interest such as the San Ramón Oxapampa and Corongo areas in the central region of the \ncountry, where some work had been conducted to identify poten tial uraniferous regions.  \nFurther studies on mineralisation in the Macusani district indicated that uranium \nmineralisation is cropping out at elevations between 4  100 m and 4  400 m around the Quenamari \nPlateau, west -northwest of Macusani. It comprises stoc kworks and associated disseminations of \ntwo coarse -grained yellow minerals, meta -autunite (hydrous calcium -uranyl phosphate) and \nsubordinately, weeksite (hydrous potassium -uranyl silicate). From a mining standpoint, \nmineralised zones are made of manto, but  are neither strictly stratiform nor strata bound . There \nis no evidence for precursor uraninite/pitchblende occurrence and the ore’s thorium content is negligible.  \nSeveral companies have focused on Macusani in an effort to further develop uranium \nresources through drilling different prospects in the district.  \nBetween 2010 and 2013, resource estimates by the Mineral Corporation for different \ncomplexes of the Macusani district were reported.  \nNATIONAL REPORTS: PERU  \n406 URA NIUM 202 2: RESOURCES, PRODUCTION AND DEMAND, NEA No. 7634, © OECD 202 3 As uranium potential in other parts of Peru is considered important , IPEN proposed to \nhighlight other areas of potential interest. In 2012, IPEN subsequently discovered new uranium \noccurrences in the San Ramón Oxapampa region, where initial results had demonstrated \nimportant uranium potential.  \nIn 2015, Plateau Uranium Inc . reported an NI 43- 101 compliant resource estimate for the \nKihitian, Isivilla and Corani uranium complexes in the Puno district.  \nIn 2016, an NI 43- 103 preliminary economic assessment (PEA) of the Macusani project was \nprepared for Plateau Energy Metals. A ccording to that report, Macusani was able to produce \nuranium at a cost of USD 38/kg U, when the international spot price for uranium was USD  66/kg U. \nThe nominated base case called for the potential economic material resource of 109 Mt of ore with an aver age grade of 245 ppm U (0.02% U) to be mined over 10 years at 10.9 Mt/a with average \nannual production of 2 340 tU.  \nSumming up the private interest, there have been several mining companies that have \nexplored for uranium in the Puno, Arequipa and Junín reg ions, including Peruvian companies \nMinera Milpo and Macusani Yellowcake, Canadian companies Vena Resources, Cardero Resources, Solex Resources, Frontier Pacific Mining, Wealth Minerals, Strathmore Minerals and Plateau Energy Metals, and Australian companie s Range Resources -Contact Uranium and Alara Uranium.  \nRecent and ongoing uranium exploration and mining development activities  \nThe Macusani district continues to be the focus of uranium exploration activities in Peru. Uraniferous mineralisation in Macusani is hosted by young rhyo lites of Upper Miocene age \n(8-6 Ma), where there are more than 70 radiometric anomalies depicted to date on the Macusani \nplateau, of which around 20 have been drilled.  \nIn 2021, American Lithium Corp. acquired Plateau Energy Metals and its projects in the \nMacusani district. In addition to holding several uranium deposits after this acquisition, American Lithium discovered three new anomalies and analyses of grab samples that led to the \ndetermination of an average uranium content of 18  270 ppm U (1.8%  U). \nBased on positive results from prospecting, mapping and sampling, American Lithium \nannounced updated drilling plans (12  000 m; 70 holes) for the Macusani project to expand existing \nuranium resources and identify new deposits. The permitting process has been initiated, \nincluding development of an environmental impact assessment and community access \nagreements. Drilling is expected to start once an exploration permit is granted.  \nIn addition, Azincourt Energy Corp. (Canada) reported intere st in intensifying exploration \nactivities at the Escalera Group uranium -lithium project located on the Picotani Plateau in south -\neastern  Peru. The Escalera Group consists of three concessions (Lituania, Condorlit, Escalera) \nacquired by the company in 2020,  covering a combined area of 7  400 hectares of prospective \nexploration targets for volcanic -hosted supergene/surficial uranium and lithium. Surface rock \nsamples obtained in 2017 -2018 from the Escalera project returned values of up to 3 560 ppm U \n(0.36% U) and 153  ppm  Li, while historical samples have yielded values up to 6  812 ppm U (0.68%  U). \nFinally, Fission 3.0 Corp. (Canada) holds the rights to 9 claim blocks encompassing 5  100 ha, \nand surface rights over some of the areas with known uranium mineralisat ion. In 2016, the \npotential of these properties was demonstrated by a drilling programme that resulted in 13 of 16 holes striking mineralisation, with high -grade uranium values of up to 12  151 ppm U (1.2% U) \nover 0.5 m only 16  m from surface, and lithium o f up to 533 ppm over 0.5  m. \nUranium resources  \nIdentified conventional resources (reasonably assured and inferred resources)  \nAccording to the NI 43- 101 report originally prepared for Plateau Energy Metals, the identified \nconventional resources of the Macusa ni district total approximately 47  710 in situ tU, comprised \nof 19 970 tU reasonably assured resources and 27 740 tU inferred resources. Since 2021 the \nMacusani project is under the control of American Lithium.  \nNATIONAL REPORTS: PERU  \nURANIUM 202 2: RESOURCES, PRODUCTION AND DEMAND, NEA No. 7634, ©  OECD 20 23 407 Identified conventional resources of Macusan i district  \n(in situ tonnes U)  \nProspect  RAR  IR Total  \nCorachapi  1 930  730 2 660  \nChilcuno  7 610  9 120  16 730  \nQuebrada Blanca  1 540  3 620  5 160  \nTantamaco  1 410  6 150  7 560  \nIsivilla  1 350  2 180  3 530  \nColibri II -III 5 650  1 580  7 230  \nNuevo Corani  480 680 1 160  \nTuturumani  0 480 480 \nCalvario I -Real  0 550 550 \nPuncopata  0 1 280  1 280  \nTupurumani  0 1 370  1 370  \nTotal  19 970  27 740  47 710  \nUndiscovered conventional resources (prognosticated and speculative resources)  \nPrognosticated conventional resources account for approximately 19 780 tU and occur in the \nfollowing sectors of Macusani: Kihitian (10 440 tU), Tupurumani (5 600 tU), Corachapi (1 910 tU), Isivilla (1 330 tU) and Corani (500 tU).  \nIn addition, there are some 45 360 tU of speculative resources, acco rding to the information \nby private companies involved in uranium exploration projects in the Macusani district, notably \nAmerican Lithium and Fission 3.0.

An industrial plant in Kowary \n(Lower -Silesian Voivodeship) was established for the exploitation and processing of uranium \nfrom local deposits.  \nResea rch beginning in 1956 by the Polish Geological Institute involved the exploration of \nCarboniferous formations of the Upper Silesian Coal Basin, phosphorite formations and research \nin boreholes in the Polish Lowlands. As a result of this research, signs of uranium mineralisation \nwere discovered in lower Ordovician formations of the Podlasie Depression (the “Rajsk” deposit) \nand in Triassic formations of the Perybaltic Syneclize and the Sudetes (Okrzeszyn, Grzmi ąca, \nWambierzyce). Approximately 20 tU were extracted from the Kopaliny -Kletno deposit.  \nIn the Ladek and Snieznik Klodzki metamorphic formations, small occurrences of uranium \nmineralisation were discovered, including the Kopaliny -Kletno deposit.  \nRecent and ongoing uranium exploration and mine development activities  \nThere are no current (up -to-date) uranium deposits documented in Poland. However, there are \nsome prospective indications of uranium and currently some small prospects amenable for the \ndiscovery o f uranium that could potentially be economically exploited.  \nIn 2014 , Poland completed geological and technological analyses and modelling of a process \nfor uranium extraction from low -grade Ordovician Dictyonema shale (black shale -type). \nAnalysis has shown that the costs of obtaining raw material required to produce 1  kg of uranium \nwould be several times higher than the uranium market price at that time. In addition, resources \nof uranium in waste heaps from prospecting and extractive operations in the Sudety  Mountains \nin the years 1948- 1967 are estimated at 10 to 30 tU. Since 2015, geological exploration of uranium \nore has not been conducted in Poland.  \nIn 2017 and 2018, the first analysis of potential unconventional uranium resources was \nprepared in Poland.  \nUranium resources  \nIdentified conventional resources (reasonably assured and inferred resources)  \nThe data presented in the table below summarises information from historic geological \ndocumentation that does not fulfil current requirements for resource repor ting and the potential \nfor mining under current economic conditions. Reinterpretation of geological data in 2009 -2010 \nshowed that Poland has no identified conventional uranium resources that could be mined under \ncurrent market conditions. Modelling of uran ium extraction by underground mining from the \nRajsk deposit related to the low -grade Ordovician Dictyonema shales (black shale -type) showed \n                                                      \n*  Report based on Red Book 2016 publication, updates from Poland and the NEA Nuclear Energy Data \n(Brown Book) 2020.  \nNATIONAL REPORTS: POLAND  \nURANIUM 202 2: RESOURCES, PRODUCTION AND DEMAND, NEA No. 7634, ©  OECD 20 23 411 that the costs of obtaining raw material to produce 1  kg of u ranium would be far too high. \nA comparison of these costs with market prices from the last 30 years implies that the extraction \nof uranium from those rocks will remain uneconomic for the foreseeable future.  \nIdentified conventional resources * \n(in situ tonnes U)  \nRegion  Resources  Uranium content (%)  \nRajsk deposi t (Podlasie Depression)  5 320  0.025  \nOkrzeszyn (Sudetes)  937.6  0.05 -0.11  \nGrzmiąca (Sudetes)  792 0.05  \nWambierzyce (Sudetes)  217.5  0.0236  \n* Note: These data represent historical geological resources that were reinterpreted in 2009 -2010 and \nunder present -day market conditions are subeconomic.  \nNo other current reasonably assured and inferred uranium resource statistics are available.  \nUndiscovered conventional resources (prognosticated and speculative resources)  \nHistorical research also led to the identificat ion of 20 000 tU of speculative resources.

Exploitation of vein deposits in the Karkonosze -\nIzera Block and metamorphic deposits in the Ladek and Snieznik Klodzki Blocks continued until \n1967. Total production amounted to 541.8 tU from deposits presented below.  \nExploitation of vein deposits in the Karkonosze -Izera Block (Wolnosc, Miedzianka, Podgorze, \nRubezal, Mniszkow, Wiktoria, Majewo, Wolowa Gora, Radoniów, Wojcieszyce) and of metamorphic deposits in the Ladek and Snieznik Klo dzki Blocks (where some small uranium \noccurrences and the Kopaliny -Kletno deposit were discovered) took place until 1967, at which \ntime the deposits were almost completely depleted.  \n  \nNATIONAL REPORTS: POLAND  \n412 URA NIUM 202 2: RESOURCES, PRODUCTION AND DEMAND, NEA No. 7634, © OECD 202 3 During this period, all uranium produced was exported to the former Soviet Union. It is \nestimated that between 1948 and 1967 approximately 650 tU were mined in the Sudetes \n(southwest Poland). Chemical treatment of low -grade ores started in Kowary in 1969 and \ncontinued until 1972, producing a significant volume of waste that wa s left in a tailings pond.  \nHistorical uranium production for selected deposits  \n(tonnes U)  \nDeposit name*  Initial resources**  Produced*** \nWolnosc  94.0  94.0  \nMiedzianka  14.7  14.7  \nPodgorze  280.0  199.0  \nRubezal  0.5 0.5 \nMniszkow  4.5 4.5 \nWiktoria  0.3 0.3 \nWolowa Gora  2.5 2.5 \nRadoniów  345.0  214.0  \nWojcieszyce  14.4  12.3  \nTOTAL  755.9  541.8  \n* Note: These are a subset of vein deposits from a larger group of deposits listed \nbelow.  \n** Resources not specified as either recoverable or in situ.  \n*** Production not spe cified, but assumed to be from concentrates.  \nStatus of production capability and recent and ongoing activities  \nThere is currently no uranium production in Poland and there are no plans for future production.  \nEnvironmental activities and socio -cultural iss ues \nAll exploitation activities associated with uranium mining and processing in Poland were \nperformed between 1948 and 1976. Although the companies associated with this activity no longer exist, there remains a need to remediate the environment in the are a around the sites \nwhere the mines operated. The Geological and Mining Law stipulates that the State Treasury is accountable for liabilities from all past uranium production activities in Poland. Therefore, the \ngovernment is responsible for funding the remediation, using either the national or the district \nEnvironmental Protection Fund.  \nThe regional authorities of the voivodship (local administration area) and its special \ninspectorates or officers are responsible for different aspects of the remediation. Th e local \nauthorities approve remediation plans and supervise their execution and impacts. The inspectorates of the Environmental Protection of a particular voivodship are responsible, in \ngeneral, for environmental monitoring. Radiological monitoring is considered a part of this overall \nmonitoring effort and it is being performed under the responsibility of the President of the \nNational Atomic Energy Agency.  \nSince 1996, Poland has taken part in the PHARE Multi -country Environmental Sector \nProgramme on “Remedi ation Concepts for the Uranium Mining Operations in Central and \nEastern European Countries” (CEEC). PHARE stands for the Poland and Hungary Assistance for \nthe Restructuring of the Economy, an initiative of the European Union. In the framework of this \nprogr amme, an inventory and a common database for the CEEC have been created. According \nNATIONAL REPORTS: POLAND  \nURANIUM 202 2: RESOURCES, PRODUCTION AND DEMAND, NEA No. 7634, ©  OECD 20 23 413 to this inventory, the situation in Poland is characterised by a large number of small -scale \nliabilities from uranium exploration, localised over several places in the count ry and generally \ncausing minor environmental impacts.  \nOnly a limited number of issues related to mining and milling are considered to be causing \nserious impacts and the most important is the tailings pond in Kowary. The 1.3  ha hydrological \nconstruction is closed on three sides by a dam that has been modified a number of times. The \ndam itself is 300  m long (the sum of three sides) and has a maximum height of 12  m. As a result \nof uranium processing activities, the tailings pond has been filled with about 250 000 tonnes of \nfine-grained gneisses and schists with average uranium content of 30  ppm (0.003% U). In the \nearly 1970s, the Wroclaw University of Technology (WUT) received, by governmental decision, \nthe ownership of both the area and the facilities of the f ormer uranium mining company. \nSubsequently, a company owned by the WUT has continued to use the existing chemical plant \nfor various experimental processes on rare earth metals, chemical production and galvanic \nprocesses. As a result, about 300 tonnes of remnants of rare earth metal processing and 5  000 m3 \nof post -galvanic fluids, with up to 30 tonnes of solids with a high content of aluminium, nickel, \nzinc and sodium sulphates, have been deposited in the pond.  \nThe remediation programme of the tailings pond was prepared in 1997 by the WUT and \nsuccessfully carried out under the PHARE programme until 2003. The specific objectives of this \nprogramme are related to the construction of drainage systems, the design and construction of \nthe tailings pond cover and the  final site reclamation.  \nThree abandoned uranium mines in the Sudetes Mountains of southwest Poland have been \nsuccessfully adapted for use as tourist attractions and for educational purposes.  \nThe National Atomic Energy Agency conducts regular monitoring of  radiation. The \nmonitoring covers the area degraded by extraction and processing of uranium ore in the Lower \nSilesia region. The monitoring programme consists of the following measurements:  \n• Total alpha and beta radioactivity in surface waters and groundwat er.  \nThe water is sampled from the natural outflow of the former uranium mine workings, \nincluding surface watercourses and reservoirs, dug wells and natural springs discharge \n(a total of 30 sampling points).  \n• Total alpha and beta radioactivity in drinking w ater.  \nThe water is sampled from the surface and underground public drinking water intakes (a total of 37 sampling points).  \n• The level of gamma radiation on the surface.  \nThe measurements of gamma dose rate in the area of former mine workings: drifts, \nshafts,  dumps and in their immediate surroundings (a total of 62 objects).  \n• Radon concentration in the atmosphere.  \nThe instantaneous radon Rn- 222 concentration measurements (radon emanation) in the \natmosphere in the open mine workings such as shafts and tunnels (a  total of 22 objects).  \n• Radon concentration in water.  \nThe water is sampled from public drinking water intakes, natural outflow from former mine workings, springs and dug wells (a total of 58 objects).  \nUranium policies, uranium stocks and uranium prices  \nNational policies relating to uranium  \nIn 2014 , the Polish government introduced nuclear into the energy mix and the Council of \nMinisters adopted the Polish Nuclear Energy Programme. One of the topics covered is the potential mining of domestic uranium resource s.  \nNATIONAL REPORTS: POLAND  \n414 URA NIUM 202 2: RESOURCES, PRODUCTION AND DEMAND, NEA No. 7634, © OECD 202 3 In 2020, the  Council of Ministers approved an update of the Polish Nuclear Energy \nProgramme. It reaffirmed the strategic plan of introducing the first nuclear power reactor with \na capacity of 1.0 to 1.5 GWe by 2033 and 5 subsequent blocks every 2- 3 yea rs. As a result, it is \nexpected that 6 reactors with a combined capacity of 6 -9 GWe will be built in Poland. In terms \nof the institutional framework, there has been a substantial change as the Ministry of Energy was dissolved and its policy making competen ces have been transferred to the newly created \nMinistry of Climate, which is now in charge of both energy and climate protection policies.  \nHistorical uranium production by production method  \n(tonnes U in concentrates)  \nProduction method  Total through \nend of  2018  2019 2020 Total through \nend of 2020  2021 (expected)  \nOpen -pit mining  0 0 0 0 0 \nUnderground mining  650 0 0 650 0 \nIn situ leaching  0 0 0 0 0 \nCo-product/by -product  0 0 0 0 0 \nTotal  650 0 0 650 0 \nHistorical uranium production by deposit type  \n(tonnes  U in concentrates)  \nDeposit type  Total through \nend of 2018  2019 2020 Total through \nend of 2020  2021 \n(expected)  \nGranite -related  435 0 0 435 0 \nMetamorphite  215 0 0 215 0 \nTotal  650 0 0 650 0 \nInstalled nuclear generating capacity to 2040  \n(MWe net)  \n2019 2020  2025 2030 2035 2040 \n0 0 Low  High  Low  High  Low  High  Low  High  \n0 0 0 0 1 000 3 000 3 000 9 000 \nAnnual reactor -related uranium requirements to 2040 (excluding MOX)  \n(tonnes U)  \n2019 2020 2025 2030 2035 2040 \n0 0 Low  High  Low  High  Low  High  Low  High  \n0 0 0 0 160 480 480 1 080 \n \nNATIONAL REPORTS: PORTUGAL  \nURANIUM 202 2: RESOURCES, PRODUCTION AND DEMAND, NEA No. 7634, ©  OECD 20 23 415 Portugal  \nUranium exploration and mine development  \nHistorical review  \nThere has been no exploration and exploitation of uranium in Portugal since 2001, although \nunexploited uranium deposits exist in the southern part of the country.  \nIn 2001, the Portuguese government launched decree law nº 198A/2001, which granted the \nstate -owned mining company Empresa de Desenvolvimento Mineiro, S.A.

A low -grade concentrate was obtained by precipitation using magnesium oxide.  \nDuring the period 1962 to 1977, Junta de Energia Nuclear (JEN) took over the mining and \nmilling activities from C PR, introducing organic solvent extraction in 1967 and expanding ore \ntreatment capacity to 100  000 t/y to produce a rich ammonium uranate concentrate. In July 1985, \na new capacity expansion to 200  000 t/yr was implemented. In all, 825 tU were produced under \nJEN management from the Urgeiriça plant and the pilot plant at Senhora das Fontes. Between \n1977 and 2001, Empresa Nacional de Uranio, SA (ENU) produced 1 772 tU.  \nOf the total historical concentrate production, 25% came from the Urgeiriça mine. The \nUrgeir iça mill stopped conventional ore processing in 1999 and was decommissioned in March \n2001. In this interim period, only charged ion -exchange resins from heap and in- place leaching \nplants, located in Bica and Quinta do Bispo mines, were processed at the Urg eiriça plant for \nyellowcake production. Nationally, 57 ore bodies have been mined, 29 by underground methods, 24 by open pit, and 4 by mixed underground/open -pit methods. In 18 of these mines, local ore \ntreatment was used, but only at Urgeiriça were uraniu m concentrates produced at an industrial \nscale. Two pilot treatment plants (Forte Velho and Senhora das Fontes) produced limited amounts \nof concentrates (sodium uranate).  \nOwnership of the Urgeiriça mill plant evolved over its operational history and after CPR \nconcluded the agreement with the Portuguese government in 1962, JEN took over until 1977 when ENU, a publicly -owned enterprise, acquired exclusive rights to uranium concentrate \nproduction and sales. In 1978, JEN exploration teams joined the Direccao- Geral de Geologia e \nMinas. In 1992, ENU was integrated into the Portuguese state- owned mining company EDM. In \nMarch 2001, EDM decided to liquidate ENU by the end of 2004.  \nStatus of production facilities, production capability, recent and ongoing activities a nd \nother issues  \nRehabilitation and remediation (environment and safety) are the only activities currently being developed by EDM.  \nFuture production centres  \nNo future production centres are planned.  \nEnvironmental activities and socio -cultural issues  \nEDM was  granted the concession by the Portuguese government to deal with mining legacy sites, \nincluding remediation work at several uranium legacy sites. This work on legacy uranium and \nradium mine sites required expenditures of more than EUR  52.6 million (USD 62 .5 million) \nbetween 2001 and 2015. An additional investment of EUR 35 million (USD 41.65 million) was spent \nbetween 2016 and 2020.  \nAs of 2020, the uranium mining and milling sites that had been or were being remediated \nincluded the Urgeiriça, Bica, Cunha Baixa, Rosmaneira, Mondego Sul, Vale da Abrutiga, Barroco, \nFreixiosa, Prado Velho, Castelejo, Mortórios, Ribeira do Bôco, Canto do Lagar and Quinta do Bispo \n(1st phase) mine sites.  \nUranium requirements  \nPortugal has no uranium requirements.  \nNATIONAL REPORTS: PORTUGAL  \nURANIUM 202 2: RESOURCES, PRODUCTION AND DEMAND, NEA No. 7634, ©  OECD 20 23 417 Uranium policies , uranium stocks and uranium prices  \nNational policies relating to uranium  \nThe recently published Ministerial Council Resolution  No. 107/2019 approved the Roadmap for \nCarbon Neutrality 2050 (RNC 2050), adopting the commitment to achieve carbon neutrality in  \nPortugal by 2050.

The most significant deposits are located in four uranium -\nbearing districts:  \n• the Streltsovsk district, which includes 19  volcanic, caldera -related deposits where \nunderground mining of some deposits is ongoing;  \n• the Trans -Ural and Vitim districts, where basal -channel sandstone -type deposits are \nbeing developed for uranium production by in situ leaching (ISL);  \n• the Elkon district, which contains large metasomatite -type deposits prospective for future \nmining.  \nRecent and ongoing uranium exploration  activities  \nThere are two types of uranium exploration activities in Russia. One involves early -stage \nprospecting aimed at new deposit discovery and preliminary evaluation, and the second involves \nadditional, more detailed exploration of earlier discovered  deposits to improve resource estimates \nand delineate new resources.  \nUranium prospecting  \nUranium prospecting is financed by the federal budget of Russia through the Federal Agency for \nMineral Resources (Rosnedra). In 2019 -2020, the work was carried out ma inly in the Siberian \nFederal District (Irkutsk and Novosibirsk Region) and in the Far Eastern Federal District (Republic of Buryatia, Trans -Baikal Region, Amur Region and Jewish Autonomous Region). The work \nfocused on two main goals: expanding the resource  base near existing uranium production \ncentres and identifying large deposits in new regions suitable for development by ISL.  \nIn 2019 and 2020, exploration was completed within the Ob area in Novosibirsk region, the \nAntasei area in the Vitim uranium ore d istrict (Republic of Buryatia), and the Kuldur area of \nKhingan plateau (Amur Region, Jewish Autonomous Region). During this period, prospecting focused on the evaluation of surficial uranium deposits, and continued within the Vitim -\nKarenga area (Trans -Baik al Region). A processing flowsheet and technical report on resources \nwill be developed based on exploration results.   \nAs a result of exploration in the Shangulezh and Ermosokhin areas of the East -Sayan \nprospective region (Irkutsk Region) 2 200 tU of progno sticated (P1) and 5  500 tU of speculative \n(P2) resources related to unconformity -type mineralisation were identified.  \nExploration of existing deposits  \nExploration of identified deposits is carried out by subsidiary uranium mining enterprises of JSC \nAtomr edmetzoloto (ARMZ), which is a part of the Russian State Atomic Energy Corporation \nRosatom.  \nNATIONAL REPORTS: RUSSIA  \nURANIUM 202 2: RESOURCES, PRODUCTION AND DEMAND, NEA No. 7634, ©  OECD 20 23 421 The main exploration activities in 2019 and 2020 were concentrated at the Dobrovolnoye \ndeposit (Dalur mine). A significant increase in investment, from 112.3  million rubles in 2019 to \n467.8 million rubles in 2020, is associated with the development of exploration drilling at the \nDobrovolnoye deposit. The completion of exploration is planned for 2023. The Priargunsky production centre continued limited exploration foc used on identifying uranium resources on \nthe flanks of the deposits by drilling boreholes from underground mine workings.  \nUranium exploration abroad  \nFrom 2018 to 2020, through Uranium One, owned by the State Atomic Energy Corporation Rosatom, \nRussia carried out exploration and pilot test work for uranium at joint ventures in Kazakhstan, \nwork in Tanzania to prepare for the development of the Mkuju River uranium project, and \nexploration in Namibia.  \nIn Kazakhstan, six uranium mines jointly owned by Uranium One are in commercial \noperation. In 2020, exploration in the expanded geological allotment of the Zarechnoye deposit \nwas completed and additional resources were identified for the extension of the life of the mine. \nIn 2021 a new exploration programme was la unched at the Kharasan mine to convert resources \ninto more reliable categories.  \nIn Tanzania, Mantra Resources (purchased by ARMZ in 2011) completed major exploration \nof the Mkuju River deposit in 2016. During 2017- 2019, further development was suspended d ue \nto unfavourable uranium market conditions. In 2020, a decision was made to build a pilot \nprocessing plant during 2021 -2022 and to proceed with pilot open -pit mining during 2023- 2025.  \nIn Namibia, Uranium One, through its subsidiary Headspring Investment s Pty., conducted \nan intensive drilling exploration programme during 2019 -2020. As a result, a new sandstone -\ntype uranium deposit (Wings) was discovered with resources confirmed by a JORC compliant technical report amounting to: indicated reasonably assure d resources (RAR) of 14 700 tU, \ninferred resources of 9 900 tU and an exploration potential of 40 000 tU. Based on 2020 results, \nresources are potentially amenable for development by ISL.  A pre -feasibility study completed in \n2021 has confirmed positive eco nomics for the ISL mining method. The 2021 exploration \nprogramme includes further drilling aimed at identifying additional resources and preparing for \nan ISL pilot test.  \nRecent mine development activities  \nJSC Dalur (Kurgan Oblast) started preparation for p ilot uranium mining at the Dobrovolnoye \ndeposit in 2020.  \nIn 2020, JSC Khiagda (Republic of Buryatia) started development at the Kolichikan deposit with \n6 530 tU RAR and the Dybryn deposit with RAR of 6 634 tU. Kolichikan is planned for commercial mining i n 2021 and Dybryn in 2023.  \nDuring 2019- 2020, the Priargunsky production centre continued construction of the surface \ncomplex and infrastructure elements of new mine No. 6 with a design capacity of 2 300 tU/yr. It will support the development of the Arguns koye and Zherlovoye deposits. Commercial mining \nis scheduled to begin in 2026.  \nThe development of deposits in the Elkon uranium region was suspended due to unfavourable \nmarket conditions.  \nUranium resources  \nIdentified resources (reasonably assured and infe rred resources)  \nAs of 1 January 2021, total recoverable uranium resources in Russia (RAR + inferred resources) amounted to 656 864 tU, while in situ known resources comprised 840  867 tU. Compared with the \ndata as of 1 January 2019, this is a decrease of 5 065 tU in recoverable resources due to depletion of the resources by mining in 2019 and 2020.  \nNATIONAL REPORTS: RUSSIA  \n422 URA NIUM 202 2: RESOURCES, PRODUCTION AND DEMAND, NEA No. 7634, © OECD 202 3 Total recoverable RAR amounted to 251 852 tU (in situ 327 099tU), of which 82% are recoverable \nat a cost of <USD 130/kgU and 8% at <USD 80/kgU. With respect to RA R, 68% are planned to be \ndeveloped by conventional underground mining methods. The majority in this group relates to \nmetasomatic -type uranium deposits in the Elkon region. All resources in the cost category of \n<USD  80/kgU relate to the sandstone- type depos its that are planned to be developed by ISL.  \nInferred recoverable uranium resources in Russia amounted to 405 012 tU (in situ 513 767 tU), \nof which less than 4% can be recovered at less than USD 80/kg. More than 70% of inferred resources are planned to be developed by underground mining from metasomatic and volcanic \ntype deposits.  \nUndiscovered conventional resources (prognosticated and speculative resources)  \nIn the Russian classification system, prognosticated resources relate to the P1 category and \nspecula tive resources relate to the P2 category. As of 1 January 2021, prognosticated (P1) resources  \nin Russia amounted to 164 690 tU, of which 110 650 tU are in the cost category of <USD  130/kgU. \nSpeculative (P2) resources amounted to 528  560 tU, of which 148  200 tU a re categorised as \n<USD  130/kgU.  \nCompared with the data as of 1 January 2019, the prognosticated resources in the cost category \nof <USD 130/kgU are almost the same, while a small decrease occurred in the <USD 260/kgU category due to the lack of confir mation of resources based on  recent geological survey data.  \nThe main portion of the undiscovered uranium resources is located in the Trans -Baikal \nRegion (the Urulyunguevsky and East -Trans -Baikal uranium ore regions), in the Irkutsk Region \n(Sayan region), a nd in the Repub lic of Buryatia (Vitim region).  \nUndiscovered resources categorised at <USD 130/kgU are dominated by sandstone -type \ndeposits, and in the cost category of <USD 260/kgU, volcanic -related and unconformity- type \ndeposits prevail. The main sandston e-type resources are concentrated in the Republic of Buryatia \n(the Vitim and South Vitim uranium ore regions), where P1 resources amount to 71  300 tU and P2 \nresources amount to 90 600 tU, accounting for 42% and 17% of all speculative resources of Russia, \nrespectively. Resources related to unconformity and volcanic type mineralisation prevail in the \nTrans -Baikal Region and the Irkutsk region. Additional P1 resources (20 000 tU) associated with \nfishbone detritus (phosphate deposit type) are located in the Erg eninsky uranium regi on in the \nRepublic of Kalmykia.  \nUranium production  \nHistorical review  \nAs of 1 January 2021, cumulative uranium production in Russia amounted to 176  482 tU. Total \nproduction at the Priargunsky production centre amounted to 153 762  tU, ma king it the world's \nlargest enterprise for aggregate production of uranium.  \nStatus of productive capabilities  \nUranium mining in Russia is carried out by three enterprises that are part of the uranium mining \ncompany Uranium Holding ARMZ (JSC Atomredmetzoloto). The annual uranium production in Russia in 2020 amounted to 2 846 tU, of which 1 240 tU were obtained by traditional underground mining and 1 606 tU by ISL.  \nThe PJSC Priargunsky Industrial Mining and Chemical Union (PIMCU)  remains the main \nuranium mi ning centre in Russia. The resource base for the enterprise includes the volcanic \ntype uranium deposits of the Streltsovsk uranium ore region with recoverable resources of 75 336 tU (96 585 tU in situ) as of 1 January 2021.  \nUranium mining was carried out at two underground mines (mine No. 1 and mine No. 8) and \nmined ore was processed either at a hydrometallurgical plant or h eap leaching site. Of the 1 240 tU \nmined in 2020 by the underground method, 1 120 tU were produced at the hydrometallurgical \nNATIONAL REPORTS: RUSSIA  \nURANIUM 202 2: RESOURCES, PRODUCTION AND DEMAND, NEA No. 7634, ©  OECD 20 23 423 plant and  120 tU were processed by heap leaching. During 2018- 2020, construction of the mine \nNo. 6 surface complex and infrastructure elements continued (design capacity of 2  300 tU/yr) for \nthe development of the Argunskoye and Zherlovoye deposits. The start of min ing is scheduled for \n2026.  \nJSC Dalur in the Kurgan Oblast carries out the development of the Dalmatovskoye, \nKhokhlovskoye and Dobrovolnoye deposits by ISL to maintain a production capacity of 600 tU/yr. \nAs of 1 January 2021, recoverable resources of the t hree deposits amounted to 9 543 tU (12 724 tU \nin situ). Uranium production in 2020 amounted to 585  tU. In 2020, the drilling of wells at the \nDobrovolnoye deposit began for pilot ISL mining that started at the end of 2021.  \nJSC Khiagda carries out ISL uraniu m mining of deposits at the Khiagda ore field in the \nRepublic of Buryatia with recoverable resources of 25 133 tU (33 510 tU in situ). In 2020, 1 021 tU \nwere produced, which is 163 tU more than in 2018. In 2019, the development of the Istochnoye \ndeposit be gan and research work was completed at the Kolichikan and Dybryn deposits. \nDevelopment of the Kolichikan deposit is planned for 2021.  \nUranium production centre technical details  \n(as of 1 January 2021)  \n Centre #1  Centre #2  Centre #3  Centre #4  \nName of produ ction centre  Priargunsky Mining \nCombine \n(Priargunsky)  Dalur  Khiagda  Elkon Mining and  \nMetallurgical \nComplex (Elkon)  \nProduction centre classification  Existing  Existing  Existing  Prospective  \nDate of first production  1968  2004  2010  NA \nSource of ore:      \nDeposit name(s)  Antei,  \nStreltsovskoe  \nand others  Dalmatovskoe, \nKhokhlovskoe, \nDobrovolnoye  Khiagda,  \nVershinnoe  \nand others  Yuzhnoe, Severnoe  \nDeposit type(s)  Volcanic  Sandstone basal \nchannel  Sandstone basal \nchannel  Metasomatic  \nRecoverable resources (tU)  75 336 9 543  25 133  303 600  \nGrade (% U)  0.16  0.04  0.05  0.15  \nMining operation:      \nType (OP/UG/ISL)  UG, HL  ISL ISL UG \nSize (tonnes ore/day)  6 700  NA NA 5 500  \nAverage mining recovery (%)  95 75 75 85 \nProcessing plant:      \nAcid/alkaline  Acid  Acid  Acid  Acid  \nType (IX/SX)  IX IX IX IX \nSize (tonnes ore/day)  4 700  No data  No data  No data  \nAverage process recovery (%)  95 98 98 95 \nNominal production capacity (tU/year)  3 000  600 1 000  5 000  \nPlans for expansion  Mine #6  Dobrovolnoye dep.

\nHistoric al uranium exploration programmes were completed in Saudi Arabia from the 1960s to \nthe 1990s by contracted foreign organisations including the United States Geological Survey \n(USGS) and Lockwood, leading to the identification of airborne radiometric anomalies. The USGS \nalso studied the uranium potential of the Ghurayyah deposit that was known for its rare earth \nelements (REE), Nb, Ta and Zr contents. Tertiary Minerals Plc identified 385 Mt of niobium -\ntantalum bearing ore grading 0.0245% Ta 2O5 at Ghurayyah. Minatome completed a multi- year \nuranium exploration programme (1979 -1984) including the follow -up of airborne radiometric \nanomalies and the evaluation and drill  testing of U and Th prospects.  \nThe mining and metals processing sector in Saudi Arabia is expe cted to grow as the country \npursues its Vision 2030 goal of having the mining sector contribute to the economy. The country \nis going through a large industrial and economic diversification that will grow resource -heavy \nmanufacturing sectors such as industr ial machinery, electrical equipment and automotive, \nleading to an increase in demand for metal and mineral products.  \nRecent and ongoing uranium exploration and mine development activities  \nSaudi Arabia initiated a strategic exploration programme for mineral resources including uranium. \nSeveral government entities were aligned and co -operated with well -known international \ninstitutions. From March 2017 to March 2019, the first phase of uranium (U) and thorium (Th) exploration was conducted, including the evalu ation of nine  designated areas (including \n36 subareas) covering a total area of 27 000 km\n2 across Saudi Arabia. Exploration targets included \nintrusive, volcanic, phosphate, calcrete and sandstone -hosted deposit types.  \nThe project aim was to carry out gener al exploration and geological assessment, including \nthe estimation of inferred resources for uranium at promising sites, according to the JORC standard. Geological, geochemical and geophysical surveys, as well as trenches were completed over the 36 subarea s, and 9 subareas were tested by drilling (70 763 m in 1 467 holes). The cost \nof the exploration programme was USD 37 million.  \nThe Ghurayyah, Jabal Sayid and Thaniyat Turayf subareas were selected for detailed \nexploration and the estimation of inferred re sources. The next phase of exploration will include \nthe continued exploration of uranium prospects, and the development of reasonably assured resources at select deposits.  \nGhurayyah Deposit (intrusive type: plutonic, peralkaline granite complex subtype –  U, Nb, Zr, \nREE, Ta + Th) \nThe Ghurayyah deposit is located in the north -western part of the Arabian Shield in Saudi \nArabia. This polymetallic deposit is hosted in a sub -circular granite complex with an outcrop \narea of 0.27 km2. Based on geological and geophy sical surveys and the drill core results, the \ngranite’s size was increased to 0.89 km2 in area. It is distributed along a north -west trending \nregional fault and extends approximately 1 100 m along strike with a maximum width of 1 100 m. The maximum U miner alisation depth is up to 500 m, and an audio -magnetotelluric \nsurvey showed that the depth of the granite could reach more than 1  000 m. The uranium -\nbearing minerals (including uranothorite) in the deposit are accessory minerals, which occur as fine-grained  disseminations as well as along micro -fractures in the granitic rocks.  \nNATIONAL REPORTS: SAUDI ARABIA  \nURANIUM 202 2: RESOURCES, PRODUCTION AND DEMAND, NEA No. 7634, ©  OECD 20 23 431  Ghurayyah Deposit mineral resource estimation  \nThe Ghurayyah deposit is a large polymetallic deposit containing inferred in situ resources of \n424 million tonnes grading 116 ppm U, (0.0 12% U) at a cut -off grade of 100 ppm U (0.01% U), and \n324 ppm ThO 2, 185 ppm Ta 2O5, 2 486 ppm Nb 2O5, 960 ppm Y 2O3 and 7  511 ppm ZrO 2, with \ncontained metal including 49 028 tU and 137 359 tonnes of ThO 2. The ThO 2, Ta 2O5, Nb 2O5, Y 2O3 \nand ZrO 2 resource estimat es were completed based on the uranium mineralisation modelling. \nThe resource remains open at depth and on the periphery of the deposit.  \nSummary of the in situ inferred mineral resources  \nin the Ghurayyah deposit, November 2019  \n(at a cut -off grade of 100 p pm U)  \nClassification  Tonnage  Grade (ppm)  \n(Mt)  tU ThO 2 Ta2O5 Nb 2O5 Y2O3 ZrO 2 \nInferred  424 116 324 185 2 486  960 7 511  \n \nContained Metal (t)  \ntU ThO 2 Ta2O5 Nb 2O5 Y2O3 ZrO 2 \n49 028  137 359  78 194  1 053 260  406 699  3 182 232  \nJabal Sayid prospect (intrusive  type: plutonic, peralkaline granite complex subtype – U, Nb, Zr, \nREE, Ta + Th)  \nThe Jabal Sayid U -Th prospect is in the central Arabian Shield about 320  km northeast of Jeddah \nand 150  km southeast of Medina, covering an area of 588 km2. The prospect is ch aracterised by a \nlarge, exposed, pegmatite- aplite mineralisation zone extending nearly 2  km in a northeast -east to \nsouthwest -west direction, with varying widths of more than 50 m in the centre to 5 -10 m in both \nthe easternmost and westernmost sections. The  outcropping mineralisation zone is consistent \nwith the high eU (> 300 ppm) and high eTh (> 1 000 ppm) radiometric anomalies revealed by \nground gamma -ray spectrometric surveys, indicating a promising U -Th mineralisation potential. \nThe mineralisation potent ial is supported by radon anomalies in the Quaternary cover area to the \nnorth of the main mineralisation zone. Besides U and Th (including uranothorite), the pegmatite -\naplite is also enriched in rare earth elements (REE) including Nb, Ta and Zr. The geolog y and grade \ncontinuity of the outcropped mineralisation zone was well established by systematic trenching \n(200 m spacing), surface channel sampling (100 m spacing), and drilling (200 m ×  (160- 200 m) \nspacing). The drilling results indicated that the mineral isation remains open to both depth, and \nalong strike to the west, with a maximum extension along the dip direction of ~ 700 m and 400  m \nin the central and western parts of the mineralised zone, respectively.  \n Jabal Sayid prospect mineral resource estimation  \nThe uranium and thorium mineral resources in the Jabal Sayid U -Th prospect were estimated \nusing the kriging method, with inferred in situ resources of 34 million tonnes grading 415  ppm U \n(0.042% U) for a total of 14 135 tU and 1 698 ppm Th (65  916 t ThO 2) reported at a cut- off grade of \n300 ppm U (0.03% U). During the exploration programme, 48 drill holes totalling 17  259 m were \ncompleted at the Jabal Sayid U -Th prospect. The chemical assay results from a total of 5 847 \nsamples, including 1 024 quality cont rol samples, were used for the resource estimation. Two \ndomains were delineated and estimated.  \nNATIONAL REPORTS: SAUDI ARABIA \n432 URA NIUM 202 2: RESOURCES, PRODUCTION AND DEMAND, NEA No. 7634, © OECD 202 3 Summary of in situ Inferred Uranium and Thorium Resources  \nfor the Jabal Sayid U -Th prospect  \n(at a cut -off grade of 300 ppm U)  \nCategory  Tonnage  Average grade Metal \n (Mt)  U (ppm)  \nTh (ppm)  tU U3O8 (t) \nTh (t)  \nThO 2 (t) \nInferred  34  415 \n1 698  14 135  16 679  \n57 821  \n65 916  \nThaniyat Turayf prospect (phosphate type)  \nThe phosphorite deposits within the sediments of the Sirhan- Turayf shelf in northern Saudi \nArabia form pa rt of the large North African Middle East Tethyan phosphate province, which \nstretches from Morocco to Iraq.

The collapse of uranium prices in the 1980s raised questions \nabout the value of these focused surveys and the viability of uranium mineralisation in areas far \ninland and with no infrastru cture, areas which could have been eliminated because of the limited \nchances of finding uranium concentrations large and rich enough to be economic.  \n1957- 1965  \nThe first work undertaken in Senegal by the French Atomic Energy Commission (CEA) from 1957 \nto 19 61 was part of a systematic aerial survey of West Africa covering Senegal, Mali, Upper Volta \nand Niger. It was during these survey flights in 1960 that an aerial radiometric anomaly, Saraya, \nwas identified at Kédougou (Southeast Senegal). Fourteen trenches  were dug, and geochemical \nsamples taken, which resulted in the identification of two types of anomalies: one in a fracture \nstriking North 130° with yellow mineralisation and the other in a light -coloured syenite with \ncalcite. Around the same time, ground verification of other airborne anomalies was undertaken, \nmainly by geochemical sampling and small research wells. Some geochemical anomalies were \ndetected (the Dalafinn site, for example), which were usually associated with laterites. In 1961, \nthe CEA made  the decision to suspend the study of anomalies at Kédougou and nothing was \nundertaken in this area until work resumed in 1974.  \nIn 1966, as part of a joint study between Mauritania and Senegal, CEA undertook a systematic \nradiometric study of the continental sedimentary basin of the Ferlo (northern Senegal) and along the bank of the Senegal River. This work, however, yielded no interesting results.  \n1974- present  \nOn 29 May 1974, the Minister of Development of Senegal sent a letter to the General Administrator  \nof the CEA, which later became the Compagnie Générale des Matières Nucléaires (COGEMA), requesting a resumption of uranium research. After a positive response, a research permit within \nEast Senegal of 38 600 km² was awarded on 27 November 1974. From 1975 to 1976, studies focused \non a series of Cambrian and Precambrian Superior lithologies on the remaining area of the permit. \nFrom 1979 to 1984, magnetometry and electromagnetism surveys on the Saraya granite identified \nuranium mineralisation in conjunction w ith episyenites, representing geological in situ resources \nestimated at about 1 500 tU at an average grade of 0.2%.  \nCOGEMA extensively explored uranium in eastern Senegal in the period 1975 -1985 (about \n400 vertical and oblique drill holes). The drastic drop in the price of uranium, in the context of \nrather mixed results, led to the discontinuation of the exploration programme. In 1975, the Total \nMining Company of Senegal led exploration studies on uranium anomalies associated with \nphosphates in secondary and tertiary basins of Cape Verde. The results were not encouraging.  \nIn 2007, exploration was revived due to uranium price increases, and as a result Areva (ex \nCOGEMA) purchased the East Saraya licence from the junior South African company UraMin.

Surface and airborne radiometric tech niques, along with prospecting, borehole logging, geoelectric and geomagnetic \nprospecting and hydrogeochemistry, were used to determine six regions of uranium \nmineralisation. Based on the results of this early work, it was concluded that the Slovak Republic \nhad few uranium resources of economic interest.  \nBetween 1985 and 1990, state exploration activities in the eastern part of the Slovak Ore \nMountains led to the estimation of resources of economic interest at the Košice deposit, but the \ndeposit was not mined. Uranium mining was terminated in 1989 -1990 and an attenuation \nprogramme for exploration and mining was instituted between 1990 and 2003, bringing state-funded exploration activities to an end. No uranium exploration occurred between 1990 and 2005.  \nLudovika Energy Ltd (a subsidiary of European Uranium Resources) continued exploration in \ntwo prospecting areas in the east of the Slovak Republic. The most promising exploration licence \nconcerns uranium mineralisation in Kuriskova, near Košice, which is loca ted within the Jahodná \npri Košiciach recreational area. On 30  January 2012, European Uranium Resources announced the \nresults of a preliminary feasibility study prepared by Tetra Tech, Inc. of Golden, Colorado. Highlights of the preliminary feasibility stud y included an initial rate of return of 30.8%, a 1.9 -year \npayback, a net present value of USD  277 million at an 8% discount rate (pre -tax, base case \nassuming prices of USD  68/lb  U\n3O8 and USD  15/lb  Mo). Indicated resources total 28.5  million \npounds of U 3O8 (10 960 tU) and inferred resources amount to 12.7  million pounds of U 3O8 (4 885 tU), \nusing a cut -off of 0.05%  U. Operating costs covering the life of the mine have been set at \nUSD 22.98/lb  U3O8 (USD  59.75/kgU), assuming a net molybdenum credit of about USD  1.27 per \npound of U 3O8 (USD  3.30/kgU). The project could have been developed as an underground mine \nand a processing facility that would utilise conventional alkaline (non -acid) processing.  \nIn April 2014, European Uranium Resources Ltd agreed to sell its Kuriskova and Novoveská \nHuta uranium projects to Forte Energy NL. In October  2014, European Uranium Resources Ltd \nannounced that the company had executed a definitive agreement that allowed Forte Energy NL \nto earn a 50% interest in the company’s uranium pr ojects. The interest would be held through \nownership of 50% of the company’s wholly owned Slovak subsidiaries at that time, Ludovika \nEnergy and Ludovika Mining, which held the mineral licences comprising the Kuriskova and Novoveská Huta uranium projects.  \nIn November 2014, European Uranium Resources Ltd reported that the management \ncommittee of the joint venture between Forte Energy NL and European Uranium Resources Ltd \nhad met in the Slovak Republic to discuss and develop plans for the Kuriskova project to be \nfunded solely by Forte. These discussions were unsuccessful, and exploration licences expired in 2015. Further discussions led to the Ministry of Enviro nment rejecting Ludovika Energy’ s \napplication to identify a new exploration area for rare earth eleme nts in the Jahodná -Kurišková \narea in late 2016.  \n                                                      \n*  Report prepared by the NEA/IAEA based on Red Book 2016, partial Red Book 2022 questionnaire respons e \nand available public data.  \nNATIONAL REPORTS: SLOVAK REPUBLIC   \n438 URA NIUM 202 2: RESOURCES, PRODUCTION AND DEMAND, NEA No. 7634, © OECD 202 3 In 2011, Crown Energy Ltd (a subsidiary of GB Energy) drilled five exploration holes (totalling \n204 m). During 2012, GB Energy completed exploration programmes over the Kluknava and Vitaz -\nII exploration areas . In June 2012, following an extensive review of archival material, Crown Energy \nLtd uncovered data from a 1960s drilling programme in the vicinity of the Kluknava and Vitaz -II \nlicence areas. Given the volume of data generated from this historic activity, GB Energy deferred \nnew exploration work until the data could be fully analysed. Detailed results of the 1960s \nprogramme were expected to be published in 2014. However, no new information on prospection \nactivities appeared publicly and exploration licences expired in 2014.  \nThe activity and exploration results of Beckov Minerals Ltd in the Horka nad Vahom -Kalnica \narea were not published.  \nRecent and ongoing uranium exploration and mine development activities  \nSince 2015, there have been several protests and la wsuits over the allocation of exploration \nareas, as well as political discussions about banning uranium mining and exploration in the \ncountry, and no new uranium exploration licences have been issued in the Slovak  Republic.  \nUranium resources  \nIdentified con ventional resources (reasonably assured and inferred resources)  \nNo new identified conventional resources have been assessed since 2012, when a pre- feasibility \nstudy was finalised and a reserves calculation report for Košice  I (Kuriskova area) was approved \nby the Commission for Reserves Classification (Ministry of Environment of the Slovak Republic). \nThis revised total increased Košice  I resources by over 9  000 tU from the total reported in 2011. \nAs of 2021, total indicated and inferred uranium resources in the two registered uranium \ndeposits represent a total of 19 319 in situ tU.  \nDeposit  Organisation  Ore resources (t)  U resources (tU)  \nKošice I  Ludovika Energy Ltd  5 427 000  15 830  \nNovoveská Huta  Ludovika Energy Ltd  3 876 000  3 489  \nUndiscovered conventional resources (prognosticated and speculative resources)  \nPrognosticated resources are estimated to occur in areas surrounding identified deposits and a new estimate of prognosticated resources for the Košice deposit was developed.

From 1961 to 1990, a total of 210 tU was mined, mainly \nfrom Novoveská Huta as a by- product of copper mining, but also from the Muran, Kravany, \nSvabovce and Vikartovce deposits.  \nNATIONAL REPORTS: SLOVAK REPUBLIC  \nURANIUM 202 2: RESOURCES, PRODUCTION AND DEMAND, NEA No. 7634, ©  OECD 20 23 439 There is  no uranium production in the Slovak Republic and none is expected in the future.  \nSecondary sources of uranium  \nThere is no production and no use of secondary sources of uranium in the Slovak Republic.  \nEnvironmental activities and socio -cultural issues  \nEnvi ronmental activities have covered monitoring in the historical mining area of the \nNovoveská Huta deposit. Monitoring has included chemical analyses of mine water outflow as \nwell as geochemical and geological engineering evaluations of the condition of tailings and \nwaste rock piles.  \nPartial monitoring of such factors has been part of a national environmental monitoring \nnetwork focused on natural or anthropogenic geological hazards (as indicated by the acronym \nČMS GF). Selected mining sites have been monitored, including the above- mentioned area.  \nWaste rock management must be performed according to Directive 2006/21/EC of the \nEuropean Parliament and of the Council of 15  March 2006 on the management of waste from  \nextractive industries and amending Directive 2004/35/EC.

Two reactors are in operation at each site and all \nfour reactors operate continually at increased power (107% of the nominal power). As of 1  January \n2021, the total installed capacity amounted to 1  814 MWe net with  uranium requi rements of \n483 tU per year . \n  \nNATIONAL REPORTS: SLOVAK REPUBLIC   \n440 URA NIUM 202 2: RESOURCES, PRODUCTION AND DEMAND, NEA No. 7634, © OECD 202 3 In 2009, construction began of an additional two reactors at the Mochovce site (units  3 and 4). \nIn Ju ly 2018, the Slovak Republic’s Prime M inister stated that the new target dates for completion \nof units 3 and 4 were 2019 and 2020. However, in April 2019, it was announced that a further delay \nof eight months was likely as a result of challenges to the permits needed for commissioning. \nUnit 3 was 99% complete at that time; unit 4, 85%. In April 2020, it was announc ed that unit 3 \nwould not be operational until November or December 2020. In May 2020, the Slovak Republic’s \nNuclear Regulatory Authority (UJDSR) announced that during post -installation checks it had found \nthat material used in some pipe connections “ did no t meet specifications” . As a result, Slovenské \nElektrárne is to carry out checks on “ several thousand ” components from the same supplier. The \nUJDSR stated that it was not possible to determine the impact of the component checks on the \ntimetable for Mochovc e 3 at that time. In February 2021, it was reported that opposition from \nAustrian environmental organisation Global 2000 could delay fuel loading to the third quarter of \n2021. In May 2021, the regulator issued an operating licence for unit 3. In October 2021, SE said it \nexpected final regulatory approval before the end of the year, allowing the first electricity to be generated in unit 3 in early 2022.  In August 2022, the final authori sation for Mochovce 3 to begin \noperating  was issued by the regulator . On 31 January 2023, Mochovce 3 was connected to the grid.  \nDesign and development work for the use of nuclear fuel with higher enrichment was \ncompleted on units 3 and 4 of the Bohunice Nuclear Power Plant and units 1 and 2 of the Mochovce \nNuclear Power Plant, and during 2014 fresh nuclear fuel with average enrichment of 4.87% of \n235U \nwas loaded into all four reactors.  \nSupply and procurement strategy  \nIn June 2014, Slovenské Elektrárne signed a contract with the Russian company TVEL to supply \nfresh nuclear fu el for units 3 and 4 of the Bohunice Nuclear Power Plant and units 1 and 2 of the \nMochovce Nuclear Power Plant. The contract covers the period from 2016 to 2021 and includes \nthe fuel fabrication for all four units and the supply of nuclear material for Boh unice unit 4 and \nMochovce unit 2. Simultaneously, Slovenské Elektrárne signed a contract with the French company Areva (currently Orano) to supply enriched uranium product for the fabrication of the nuclear fuel for Bohunice unit 3 and Mochovce unit 1, cov ered by the above -mentioned contract \nwith TVEL.  \nUranium policies, uranium stocks and uranium prices  \nNational policies relating to uranium  \nEnergy Policy of the Slovak Republic (Resolution of the Government of the Slovak Republic \nNo. 29/2006)  \nOne of the prio rities set to meet energy policy objectives is to utilise domestic primary energy \nsources for electricity and heat production in an economically effective way.  \nEnergy Security Strategy of the Slovak Republic (Resolution of the Government of the Slovak  Repu blic No. 732/2008)  \nThe objective of the Energy Security Strategy is to achieve a competitive, secure, reliable and \nefficient supply of all forms of energy at reasonable costs that protects consumers and the environment and promotes sustainable development,  security of supply and technical safety.  \nThe high share of nuclear energy in the energy mix of the Slovak Republic relies on \ndependable sources of a sufficient number of fuel elements, which in Europe are offered only by Russia and France. It is possible that in the future, these fuel element producers could require \nfrom customers a counter -value in the form of uranium as a certain form of payment. If this \noccurs it will be necessary to create the appropriate legislative conditions for the extraction of \nuranium by amending the relevant laws and strategic documents, including the Raw Materials \nPolicy, since domestic deposits of uranium ore are located near Košice and Spisska Nova Ves – \nNovoveská Huta.  \nNATIONAL REPORTS: SLOVAK REPUBLIC  \nURANIUM 202 2: RESOURCES, PRODUCTION AND DEMAND, NEA No. 7634, ©  OECD 20 23 441 Legislative and economic support for the efficient and ra tional use of domestic uranium \nresources is needed to considerably reduce the dependency on imported energy sources, whose \nmarket prices have risen sharply in past years. Increased uranium prices and higher nuclear \nfuel costs can privilege those states which will be able to supply their own uranium and require its further processing to produce nuclear fuel.  \nThe possibility of extracting uranium in the Slovak Republic is also to be assessed from the \nperspective of maximum environmental protection. Mining pro jects must be harmonised with \nthe development of documentation by concerned municipalities and regional governments in \nconformity with the applicable legislation.  \nIn order to meet the Energy Security Strategy targets, it is necessary to assess the feasibil ity \nof uranium extraction in the Slovak Republic. It is important to rationally and effectively support \nthe use of domestic energy sources with the aim of decreasing dependency on imports.  \nAssessing the viability of uranium mining in the Slovak Republic wa s one of the priorities of \nthe country ’s 2008 Energy Security Strategy. However, in May 2014 the government resolved to \nban uranium mining in the country unless it is approved by a referendum of local inhabitants. \nThe Slovak Environment Ministry proposed t he amendment to the law, which came into effect in \nJune 2015.  \nEuropean Uranium signs a memorandum of understanding with the Slovak Ministry of Economy  \nIn December 2012, European Uranium Resources Ltd (EUU) reported that it had signed a memorandum of unders tanding with the Ministry of Economy of the Slovak Republic. The \nmemorandum defines the parameters by which EUU and the ministry will co -operate in \nadvancing the Košice uranium deposit –  on which EUU holds the exploration licence –  through \nongoing feasibil ity and environmental studies. A pre -feasibility  study (PFS) completed by Tetra \nTech, Inc. indicates that the Košice uranium deposit can be developed as an underground mine \nusing the best technologies available with minimal environmental impact and that it  could be \none of the lowest -cost uranium producers in the world.  \nAfter the affected municipalities and civic associations voiced disagreement, all the \nmentioned activities were stopped.  \nUranium stocks  \nThe Slovak Republic does not maintain an inventory of n atural or reprocessed uranium.  \nSlovenské Elektrárne has a small stock of enriched uranium in the form of complete fuel \nassemblies.

In 1968, the P -10 tunnel was developed to \naccess the orebody. Mining began at Žirovski Vrh in 1982 and uranium concentrate production \n(as yellow cake) began in 1985. The mine ceased operations in 1991.  \nRecent a nd ongoing uranium exploration and mine development activities  \nExpenditures for exploration ended in 1990. There are no recent or ongoing uranium exploration activities in Slovenia.  \nUranium resources  \nIdentified conventional resources (reasonably assured an d inferred resources)  \nA resource assessment of the Žirovski Vrh deposit was carried out in 1994. Reasonably assured resources are estimated to amount to 2 200 tU (in situ) with an average grade of 0.14%  U in the \n<USD  80/kgU cost category.

Ore production began in 1982 and the associated ore processing plant (annual production capability of 102  tU) began operations in 19 84, initially treating \nstockpiled ore. The ore, which occurs in numerous small bodies in the mineralised coarse -grained \nsandstone, was mined selectively using a conventional underground room and pillar, cut -and-fill \noperation with a haulage tunnel and vent ilation shaft. In 1990, operations were terminated. \nCumulative production from the Žirovski Vrh mine and mill complex totalled 386.7  tU (calculated).  \nStatus of production capability  \nIn 1992, a decision made to close and decommission the Žirovski Vrh mine a nd mill complex \nand there has been no production at the facility since. All production was carried out in the former Yugoslavia. In 1994, the Slovenian government adopted the plan for decommissioning the facility. The production facility was dismantled and  no longer exists.  \nNATIONAL REPORTS: SLOVENIA  \n446 URA NIUM 202 2: RESOURCES, PRODUCTION AND DEMAND, NEA No. 7634, © OECD 202 3 Environmental activities and socio -cultural issues  \nThe government -owned Žirovski Vrh Mine Company manages all activities connected with the \nrehabilitation of the former uranium production site, consisting of underground mining facilitie s, \nsurface milling facilities, the waste rock pile and tailings disposal site. It obtains all remediation \npermits required, performs the remediation works and monitors the environmental impact of the \nsite during the remediation phase. After finishing the r emediation work, the remaining disposal \nsites and the mine water effluents are put under long -term environmental surveillance, which is \ncarried out by the national Agency for Radioactive Waste Management. The mine effluents are \nmonitored for uranium, radiu m and other chemical contaminants, and the disposal sites are \nmonitored for radon exhalation and uranium and radium in water effluents.  \nThe annual effective dose contribution from all mine sites has significantly decreased as a \nresult of remediation activities. Since 2011 it has dropped below 0.1 mSv/a, from about 0.4  mSv/a \nduring operation. Background annual effective levels are 5.5  mSv/a in the area surrounding the \nmine.  Associated with the uranium production site are a hydrometallurgical tailings disposa l \nsite and a waste rock disposal site. Environmental remediation of the disposal site for \nhydrometallurgical tailings is in its final stage, the critical factor being the stability of the site. \nAll remediation work is finished on the site of the mine waste  pile, and in 2015, the long- term \nenvironmental surveillance of the site started.  \nMonitoring  \nThe mine’s air and water effluents have been monitored on a regular basis since the start of the ore production in 1982. The programme was modified when production  stopped in 1990 and is \nongoing. Emissions to surface waters and air are monitored, and doses to the local population \nhave been calculated since 1980. Treatment of the mine’s effluents is not planned, considering \nthe low concentrations of radioactive conta minants.  \nIn 2019, the monitoring network was renovated and upgraded with an additional nine deep \npiezometers. As part of the long -term surveillance and maintenance programme, the surfaces \nof the Jazbec mine waste disposal site and the Boršt hydrometallurgical tailings disposal site are controlled regularly. In the event of heavy rain or an earthquake, additional site controls are \nconducted. The rate of sliding of the base of the Boršt hydrometallurgical tailings disposal site \nis measured in real time, using  a GPS system, at control points on the hydrometallurgical \ntailings. Since 2018, geodetic surveillance has been carried out twice a year. A network, entitled “Vrtine -2”, has been added to the basic landslide surveillance network.  \nTailings impoundment  \nThere  is one 4.2 ha specially designed long -term site for hydrometallurgical tailings, called Boršt. \nIt is situated on the slope of a hill between 535 and 565 m above sea level. At this disposal site, \n610 000 tonnes (t) of hydrometallurgical waste, 111 000 t of mine waste and 9  450 t of material, \ncollected during decontamination of the mill tailings in the Boršt site vicinity, have been \ndisposed, with a total activity of 48.8  TBq. The amount of excavated ore was about 630  000 t and \nthe amount of the processed or e was about 610 000 t.  \nThe tailings have been stored in a dry condition as a result of the filtration of the leached \nliquor. The surface was topped with a 2 -m thick, engineered multilayer soil cover with a clay base \nto prevent leaching of contaminants, and  covered with grass. Although remediation of the site \nwas completed in 2010, it required drainage intervention measures to reduce the groundwater \nlevel and slow down landslide movement that was activated beneath the disposal site. The results \nof additional slope stabilisation work, performed in 2016 and 2017, will help determine if the \ndisposal site meets the conditions for site closure and the beginning of long -term environmental \nsurveillance.  \nIn 2018, the Expert Project Council for monitoring the remedia tion work on the \nhydrometallurgical tailings prepared a final report. The effects of the maintenance, monitoring \nand intervention measures (performed between 2010 and 2018) to reduce the groundwater impact \non the stability of the Boršt hydrometallurgical t ailings disposal site were assessed, as well as the \ncurrent state of the Boršt disposal site. In 2019, the monitoring network of the Boršt \nNATIONAL REPORTS: SLOVENIA  \nURANIUM 202 2: RESOURCES, PRODUCTION AND DEMAND, NEA No. 7634, ©  OECD 20 23 447 hydrometallurgical tailings disposal site was renovated and upgraded with nine additional deep \npiezometers. The safet y report for the Boršt hydrometallurgical tailings disposal site is under \nrevision. This is the basic document for the closure of the disposal facility and the transition to \nlong -term surveillance and maintenance, which will be carried out by the Agency fo r Radioactive \nWaste Management (ARAO) as part of a mandatory service of general economic interest.  \nWaste rock management  \nAll waste rock piles were relocated to the central mine waste pile, Jazbec. All other sites have been \nrestored to a green field condition. The 6.7 ha Jazbec facility contains 1  910 425 t of mine waste, \nlow-grade uranium ore, red mud, filter cake from the mine water treatment station, and \ncontaminated material from the decommissioning of mining and milling facilities, with a total \nactivity  of 21.7 TBq. It is covered with an engineered two -metre -thick multilayer of soil and \nplanted grass. A concrete drainage tunnel was constructed at the bottom of the waste rock pile to \ndrain seepage and groundwater into a local stream. Environmental remediation works at the \nJazbec disposal site were completed and the administrative procedure for site closure finalised in \n2015. The responsibility for long -term surveillance and maintenance of the site was transferred to \nthe ARAO in 2015.  \nUranium requirements  \nThe sole nuclear power plant in Slovenia is based at Krško and called Nuklearna Elektrarna \nKrško. It started commercial operation in January 1983 and was modernised in 2000 with replacement steam generators that increased net capacity to 676 MWe. Net capac ity was \nincreased in 2006 to 696 MWe with low -pressure turbine replacement and again in 2009 to \n698 MWe after modernisation of the turbine control system  with the installation of a new high -\npressure turbine in 2022 . The power plant is 50% owned by Slovenia  and Croatia.  \nThere has been no significant change in the Slovenian nuclear energy programme in the \nlast few years. Uranium requirements for Nuklearna Elektrarna Krško are relatively stable and account for about 149  tU per year. The current fuel cycles are  18 months in duration and are \nplanned to continue on this cycle basis. In 2012, the Slovenian Nuclear Safety Administration \napproved the ageing management programme, a prerequisite for the operation of Nuklearna \nElektrarna Krško beyond 2030 until the year  2043.  In January 2023 the Slovenian Ministry of \nEnvironment issued the final approval for NPP Krško  until 2043 following the completion of an \nenvironmental assessment.   \nSupply and procurement strategy  \nThe total uranium requirement of Nuklearna Elektrarna Krško per operating cycle remain \nunchanged and as reported in previous editions of the Red Book. There are no operating or \nstrategic uranium reserves in Slovenia and supply is imported based on requirement contracts.  \nThe current uranium supply contract cov ers requirements until 2028. The current \nprocurement strategy utilises enriched UF 6 supplied to the fuel manufacturer from the uranium \nsupplier when it is required for fuel assembly construction. No physical deliveries of U 3O8 or UF 6 \nare made to the Nuklea rna Elektrarna Krško site. The manufactured fuel assemblies arrive just \nbefore they are used for power production. There are no plans in the foreseeable future to build \na uranium stockpile by Nuklearna Elektrarna Krško. The strategy for commercial spent nu clear \nfuel management currently does not include the use of reprocessed uranium and Nuklearna \nElektrarna Krško is not licensed for MOX use.  \nUranium policies, uranium stocks and uranium prices  \nNational policies relating to uranium  \nSlovenia is not a uranium -producing country.

It has steadily and consistently produced uranium since then, albeit at a lower level in recent years. Seven of the fifteen deposit types defined in the Red B ook are \nfound in South Africa, namely paleo -quartz -pebble conglomerate, sandstone, lignite and coal, \nintrusive, surficial, phosphate and granite -related deposits. A major part of the resource base is \nhosted by the quartz -pebble conglomerates and derived ta ilings, with significant amounts of \nresources in the sandstone and coal -hosted deposits. The other deposit types make a relatively \nsmall contribution to the national uranium resource inventory.  \nThere are six distinct uranium provinces in South Africa. The  oldest are the Palaeozoic -aged \nMozaan basin in the north- east and the slightly younger Witwatersrand Basin in central South \nAfrica. The Precambrian -aged Palabora and Pilanesberg carbonatite complexes lie in the north, \nwith the Precambrian to Cambrian gran ite complexes in the north- west. The sandstone deposits \nof the Karoo in the south -central parts, as well as the coal -hosted deposits of the Springbok Flats \nare of Permo -Triassic age. The youngest are the Tertiary to recent surficial deposits in the \nNorthwe st Cape and the phosphorite deposits off the south -west coast.  \nThe surge in uranium prices between 2005 and 2007 stimulated significant corporate \ninterest in South Africa. Much of the ground over the Witwatersrand Basin was held by existing mining companie s and extensive re -evaluations of uranium resource holdings were undertaken. \nOf great interest were the resources held in the vast tailings dams created by over 100  years of \ngold mining. Gold Fields, Rand Uranium, Harmony and AngloGold Ashanti launched det ailed \nfeasibility studies into the resources contained in tailings.  \nAvailable areas with known uranium occurrences, such as in the Karoo Basin and Springbok \nFlats, were quickly acquired by companies UraMin, Holgoun Energy and others. UraMin was \nsubsequentl y acquired by Areva, which included the Trekkopjie deposit in Namibia and the Ryst \nKuil Channel in the Karoo Basin. Smaller companies obtained prospecting licences over lesser -\nknown deposits in the Karoo Basin, as well as deposits in the granitic and surficial terrains in the northwest of the country.  \nPeninsula Energy operated in South Africa through its subsidiary Tasman RSA Holdings (Pty) \nLtd and had a total of 41 prospecting rights covering 7 774 km\n2 in the Karoo Uranium Province. \nPeninsula Energy identi fied new areas of uranium mineralisation in the stacked sandstone units \nwhich host extended uranium mineralisation beyond the historic drilling limits, thereby increasing the resource potential. In December 2012, Peninsula Energy acquired all of Areva’s properties located in the Karoo Uranium Province, including the Ryst Kuil deposit. Since the \ncommencement of exploration in 2006, Tasman has completed approximately 31  000 m of \nreverse circulation and diamond drilling, and geophysically logged an additional 15  000 m of \nopen historic holes. In February 2013, Tasman commenced drilling along the Ryst Kuil channel in the Eastern Sector of its Karoo projects, which has returned encouraging initial results.  \n  \n                                                      \n*  Report prepared by the NEA/IAEA, based on previous Red Books and public data.  \nNATIONAL REPORTS: SOUTH AFRICA  \nURANIUM 202 2: RESOURCES, PRODUCTION AND DEMAND, NEA No. 7634, ©  OECD 20 23 451 In 2013, Peninsula released positive results from an in itial scoping study, enabling the \ncommencement of the pre -feasibility study in the second half of 2013, which included extensive \nmetallurgical test work. In June 2014, the company submitted mining rights applications over \nall their prospecting areas in the  Karoo region. The application process was expected to take up \nto two years and hence the planned start of mine development was delayed from 2016 to 2018.  \nIn 2012, HolGoun Uranium and Power Limited completed a pre- feasibility study of its project \nin the Sp ringbok Flats Basin, where uranium is hosted by coal, then followed up with a more \ndetailed economic feasibility study. The economic feasibility study comprised resource and \nreserve estimations, bulk -sampling and pilot plant test work, geotechnical and groundwater \nstudy, mine and underground infrastructure design, overall environmental issues, financial and \neconomic evaluations, and a mining rights application. The initial development of this project envisaged an annual production capacity of about 700  tU\n3O8 (595 tU) at a feed grade of 0.096% U \nof ore during the first seven years of production. Thereafter, the annual production was planned \nto be about 500  tU3O8 (425 tU) at a feed grade of 0.063% U of ore.  \nGold One International Ltd acquired the Rand Uranium  properties, as well as the Ezulwini \nmine, in 2012. One of the key objectives associated with these acquisitions was to re -establish the \nCooke underground and Randfontein surface operations as gold mines and subsequently to \ndevelop uranium co -product poten tial. The Cooke underground operations comprise Cooke  1, 2, 3 \nand Ezulwini. Ezulwini was integrated into the Cooke underground complex as Cooke  4. Ongoing \nexploration and resource development work highlighted numerous potential resource extensions. \nA feasi bility study was completed in 2012 on a high uranium yielding area at Cooke  3, which \nconsists of both unmined ground and several higher -grade pillars. The area is associated with \nexisting underground development. The feasibility study considered uranium ex traction through \nthe Cooke  4 uranium plant (Ezulwini). The Randfontein surface operations host gold and uranium \nsurface resources which present attractive opportunities for future extraction. These tailings \ninclude the Cooke tailings dam, the Millsite comp lex, Lindum, Dump  20 slime, and the Old  4 dam.  \nIn 2012, Harmony Gold Ltd developed two uranium projects to the feasibility stage: Harmony \nUranium TPM (Tshepong, Phakisa, and Masimong) and the Free State Tailings Uranium Project. \nThe initial plans were tha t the TPM project would be extracting uranium from the Tshepong, \nPhakisa, and Masimong underground mines while the Free State Tailings Uranium Project \nwould be extracting uranium from the old tailings storage facilities owned by Harmony. The feasibility st udy of the TPM project was supported by a demonstration plant campaign and \nassociated metallurgical test work. However, these projects have been deferred because of financial constraints.  \nNamakwa Uranium conducted uranium exploration on the Henkries Projec t. Most of the \ndelineated resources, mainly in Henkries Central, occur within 20  metres from the surface. \nGiven the shallow and soft nature of the deposit, as well as good infrastructure serving the project area, the project was regarded as potentially via ble for future uranium extraction. Xtract \nResources conducted due diligence with a view to acquiring the Henkries Project in the Namaqualand, Northern Cape Province in 2014. However, Xtract has decided not to go ahead with the acquisition of the Namakwa Ur anium deposit as it has found that the project does not \nmeet its investment criteria.  \nRecent and ongoing uranium exploration and mine development activities  \nIn 2017, Peninsula completed draft environmental impact assessment and environmental management pr ogramme reports for the Ryst Kuil and Quaggasfontein areas (Karoo projects). \nThe proposed mining operation was to be known as the Tasman RSA Mines and would be operated as a single entity, but with multiple production centres (Kareeport, Ryst Kuil, and \nQuaggasfontein) feeding a central processing plant to be located near the main ore body within \nthe Ryst Kuil project area. In April 2018, Peninsula announced its decision to withdraw from the \nKaroo projects in which it had a 74% interest. It suspended all dev elopment activities including \npreparation of exploration and mining right applications.  \n  \nNATIONAL REPORTS: SOUTH AFRICA  \n452 URA NIUM 202 2: RESOURCES, PRODUCTION AND DEMAND, NEA No. 7634, © OECD 202 3 AngloGold Ashanti’s operations in South Africa are all located in the Witwatersrand Basin, \nin two mining districts: the Vaal River and West Wits areas. The Vaal River  Surface operations \nare located to the north of the Vaal River, close to the town of Orkney in the North West province. \nThe Mine Waste Solution (MWS) operations are located approximately 15  km from the town of \nKlerksdorp near Stilfontein within 20  km of th e Vaal River Surface operations. The MWS feed \nsources are scattered over an area that extends approximately 13.5 km north- south and 14  km \neast-west. The West Wits surface operations are located near the town of Carletonville, \nstraddling the border between the North West and Gauteng provinces. These operations extract \ngold and uranium from the low -grade stockpile material emanating as a by- product of the reef \nmining activities within the mines in the Vaal River area. In October 2017, AngloGold Ashanti \nannounced that it was selling assets, including the Moab Khotsong mine and related \ninfrastructure, its interest in Nuclear Fuels Corp of South Africa, and its interest in the Margaret \nWater Company to Harmony Gold Mining. Anglo Gold Ashanti kept the Mponeng mine  and MWS \nsurface operations. As of 1  January 2019, AngloGold Ashanti uranium resources of Vaal River \nand MWS operations amounted to 39  466 tU of reasonably assured resources (6  131 tU of \nmeasured resources and 33  335 tU of indicated resources).  \nIn 2014, Si banye Gold Ltd acquired the Cooke assets and Randfontein operations from Gold \nOne Ltd, and also the Witwatersrand Consolidated Gold Resources Limited (Wits Gold) assets. \nA detailed feasibility study of the West Rand Tailings Retreatment Project (WRTRP) was completed \nby mid -2015. The definitive feasibility study focused on leveraging existing surface infrastructure \nas well as the available uranium treatment capacity at the Ezulwini gold and uranium processing \nplant to sustain surface gold and uranium product ion prior to the development of the central \nprocessing plant.  \nThe Driefontein, Kloof, and Cooke surface operations and associated processing facilities \nare located on the West Rand of the Witwatersrand Basin, while Beatrix is in the southern Free \nState go ldfields. Sibanye -Stillwater also has an interest in surface tailings retreatment facilities \nlocated from the East Rand to the West Rand through a 38.05% stake in DRDGOLD Limited \n(DRDGOLD).  \nAs of 1  January  2019, Sibanye- Stillwater resources amounted to 10 338 tU of reasonably \nassured resources (3  288 tU of measured resources and 7 050 tU of indicated resources), 35 tU of \ninferred resources at the Beatrix underground mine, and 19 894 tU of reasonably assured \nresources (16  072 tU of measured resources and 3  822 tU of indicated resources) at WRTRP. In \n2018, uranium resources declined due to the sale of a portion of WRTRP to DRDGOLD. The surface rock dumps at Driefontein were depleted in 2018.  \nIn August 2018, Mintails Mining South Africa (Pty) Ltd and several r elated companies \nannounced their liquidation. Mintails used to mine and process gold and uranium from waste \npiles and open pits in Krugersdorp near Johannesburg.  \nUranium resources  \nThe last official country report by South Africa was in 2016. New resource estimates have been \nmade since 2016, but mainly for tailings and a few deposits.  \nIn 2020, resource re- estimations were completed for the following deposits: Beatrix (quartz -\npebble conglomerate), Cooke surface dumps (tailings), Freestate -Harmony (tailings), Kopanang \n(tailings), Mispah (tailings), Moab Knotsong (quartz -pebble conglomerate), Stilfontein (tailings) \nand Vaal River (tailings).  \nThe following table shows the changes of recoverable resources (tU) between 2019 and the \ndate of re -estimation for thes e deposits. As for the previous estimates, the new resource \nestimates give a breakdown according to confidence level (RAR and IR), but not per cost category.  \nResource estimates, as of 1 January 2021, have been obtained by discounting the resource \nchanges t o the <USD260/kgU cost category.  \n  \nNATIONAL REPORTS: SOUTH AFRICA  \nURANIUM 202 2: RESOURCES, PRODUCTION AND DEMAND, NEA No. 7634, ©  OECD 20 23 453 Deposit  Type  RAR 2018 \n(tU)  RAR 2021 \n(tU)  Change  \n(tU)  IR 2018 \n(tU)  IR 2021 \n(tU)  Change  \n(tU)  \nBeatrix  \nCooke  \nFreestate \nKopanang  \nMispah  \nMoab Knotsong  \nStilfontein  \nVaal River  QPC  \nTailings  \nTailings  \nTailings  \nTailings  \nQPC  \nTailings  \nTailings  7 444 \n14 325 \n11 277 \n2 394 \n6 329 \n7 811 \n12 832 \n15 525  7 450 \n14 318 \n8 862 \n881 \n5 539 \n7 001 \n11 632 \n19 940  6 \n(7) \n(2 415)  \n(1 513)  \n(790)  \n(810)  \n(1 200)  \n4 415 25 \n0 \n0 \n296 \n0 \n2 609 \n0 \n0 27 \n0 \n0 \n0 \n0 \n2 223 \n0 \n0 2 \n0 \n0 \n(296)  \n0 \n(386)  \n0 \n0 \nTotal   77 937  75 623 (2 314)  2 930  2 250  (680)  \nIdentified conventional resources (reasonably assured and inferred resources)  \nThe total recoverable identified conventional resources for South Africa, as of 1  January 2021, \namounted to 444 749 tU (RAR: 255 713 tU, IR: 189 036 tU).  \nThe Witwatersrand Basin contains about 79% of total identified uranium resources in South \nAfrica, in both the underground, hosted by quartz -pebble conglomerates, and their resulting \ntailings storage facilities. Approximately 47% of the total national identifie d resources are in the \nWitwatersrand underground operations, 28% in their associated tailings facilities, 20% in the \nSpringbok Flats Basin, and about 5% in the sandstone -hosted deposits of the Karoo Basin. The \nuranium pay limit in most parts of the Witwate rsrand Basin is calculated on a by -product basis, \naccording to which the uranium is not classified as a resource unless it occurs in an area of gold mineralisation that satisfies the estimated gold cut -off grades. In addition, uranium production \nin these p rojects only includes the costs of transporting ore from the underground or tailings \noperations to the processing plants and the treatment of uranium, while gold carries all other \ncosts.  \nUndiscovered conventional resources (prognosticated and speculative resources)  \nUndiscovered conventional resources amount to 850 000 tU, which includes the <USD  260/kgU \nand unassigned cost categories.  \nThe Witwatersrand Basin has a total of about 470 tailings storage facilities with uranium \nresources, most of which are not  included as reasonably assured and inferred conventional \nresource totals. The Karoo Uranium Province is estimated to contain between 90  000 and about \n150 000 tU. This estimate has not changed since the last reporting period.  \nUnconventional resources and o ther materials  \nAs reported in the 2011 edition of the Red Book, a field of manganiferous phosphate nodules \nwas identified off the west and southwest coast of South Africa on the continental shelf. The nodules contain low grades of uranium and are currently  considered uneconomic with respect \nto both phosphate and uranium extraction. Renewed interest in phosphate -hosted uranium \ndeposits, however, may generate future investigation. The unconventional resources have been previously estimated to amount to 180  000 tU and are unchanged for this reporting period.  \nUranium production  \nHistorical review  \nSouth Africa has been a consistent producer of uranium since 1952, but its international importance has declined in recent years. In the late 1970s and early 1980s, it ranked as the second or third -largest producer in the world, but since the end of the 1990s output has declined \nNATIONAL REPORTS: SOUTH AFRICA  \n454 URA NIUM 202 2: RESOURCES, PRODUCTION AND DEMAND, NEA No. 7634, © OECD 202 3 significantly, and by 2018, South Africa ranked 12th in global uranium production. Peak production \nwas achieved at over 6  000 tU/yr in the early  1980s, when it accounted for 14% of total world output.  \nMost of South Africa’s historical uranium production was derived from quartz -pebble \nconglomerate deposits with a small proportion being from the Palabora copper -bearing \ncarbonatite. Current productio n is sourced from the quartz -pebble conglomerate deposits and \nassociated tailings.  \nThe majority of past production was as a by -product of gold or, to a minor extent, copper. \nOnly two primary uranium producers have existed in South Africa. The first was the  Beisa mine \nin the Free State in the early 1980s, and the second was the Dominion Reefs Uranium Mine near \nKlerksdorp, which operated in the early 2000s.  \nIn 2019 and 2020, uranium production amounted to 185 tU and 62 tU respectively at the \nHarmony Gold Vaal  River operation (Moab Knotsong mine). In 2021, expected production in \nSouth Africa is estimated at 192 tU.   \nAt the end of March 2020, the government imposed a 21- day lockdown in response to the \ncoronavirus pandemic. As part of the lockdown, all mining ope rations (apart from coal mines \nsupplying Eskom) were initially suspended. The lockdown regulations were amended in mid -\nApril 2020 to allow mining to resume at up to 50% of normal capacity.  \nStatus of production facilities, production capability, recent and ongoing activities and other \nissues \nAngloGold Ashanti acquired the MWS tailings retreatment operation in the Vaal River region in \nJuly 2012. MWS comprises tailings storage facilities that originated from the processing of ore from \nthe Buffelsfontein, Harte beestfontein and the Stilfontein gold mines. After selling its Vaal River \nassets to Harmony Gold Mining in early 2018, operations at the NWS uranium plant ceased in 2018.  \nUranium production from the Sibanye -owned Cooke operations began in May 2014. The Cooke \nshafts were used to mine multiple reefs. Uranium processing was done at the Cooke  4 (Ezulwini) \nUranium plant. Uranium production at the Ezulwini -Cooke plant and mine operations ended in \n2016, and the associated surface rock dumps at Driefontein were dep leted in 2018.  \nThe Moab Khotsong mine  is located in the northern part of  South Africa , in North \nWest  province, about 180 kilometres southwest of Johannesburg. Moab Khotsong represents \none of the largest gold and uranium  reserves in  South Africa  having estimated reserves of \n57.2 million tonnes of ore grading 0.053%  uranium  and 8.2  g/t of gold. Moab Khotson g claims to \nbe home to the world’s deepest mine shaft at 3 000 metres. Harmony Gold acquired Moab \nKhotsong from  AngloGold Ashanti Limited  on 1  March  2018 for USD  300 million. The assets \nwere the Moab Khotsong mine and related infrastructure, its entire interest in Nuclear Fuels \nCorp of South Africa and its entire interest in the Margaret Water Company.  \nOwnership structure of the uranium industry  \nIn April 2018, Peninsula announced its decision to withdraw from the Karoo projects, in which it had a 74% interest. It suspended all development activities including preparation of exploration and mining right applications.  \nIn 2014, Sibanye assumed control of the Cooke underground  and surface operations, including \nthe Randfontein operations, from Gold One International Limited (Gold One), and concluded the \nacquisition of Witwatersrand Consolidated Gold Resources Limited. In 2018, Sibanye sold a portion \nof WRTRP to DRDGOLD.  \nFuture production centres  \nFuture production centres could include the Dominion Reef mine and Beaufort West deposit \n(Karoo Basin).  \nNATIONAL REPORTS: SOUTH AFRICA  \nURANIUM 202 2: RESOURCES, PRODUCTION AND DEMAND, NEA No. 7634, ©  OECD 20 23 455 Environmental activities and socio -cultural issues  \nExploration and mining companies are committed to the responsible use and managemen t of the \nnatural resources under their prospecting and mining rights. Site visits and inspections are \nconducted regularly to verify that the commitments detailed in their environment management \nprogrammes are being adhered to. Exploration and drilling include a responsibility to rehabilitate \neach site once drilling has been completed. In terms of applications for mining rights, and as part \nof the Social and Labour Plan, companies are required to inform the interested and affected parties \nin the proposed min ing area of its intended activities.  \nThe Broad -Based Socio -Economic Empowerment Charter for the South African Mining and \nMinerals Industry (The Mining Charter), which gives effect to the Mineral and Petroleum Resources Development Act No. 28 of 2002, is a imed at transforming the mining industry to \nredress historical imbalances by substantially and meaningfully expanding opportunities for \nhistorically disadvantaged South Africans (HDSA). The charter has given mining companies \nprovision to offset the value of the level of beneficiation achieved against a portion of its HDSA ownership requirements of up to 11% as compared to the current required level of 26% (to be achieved by the end of 2014). Furthermore, mining companies are required to procure a \nminimum of  40% of their capital goods, 70% of services and 50% consumables from Black \nEconomic Empowerment entities.  \nAngloGold Ashanti has designed a framework, following extensive stakeholder engagement, \nto integrate community development into core business activit ies, while providing support for \nnational development policies and objectives, particularly those addressing youth unemployment. \nAngloGold Ashanti’s contribution to education in both local and labour -sending communities is a \npriority. In addition, the Merafong Agricultural Project, which employs 20  people, is funded by \nAngloGold Ashanti. Other social responsibilities included economic initiatives in the labour -\nsending areas such as the remote villages of the Eastern Cape Province .  \nRegulatory regime \nThe Dep artment of Mineral Resources, the Department of Water Affairs, the Department of \nEnvironmental Affairs and the Department of Energy, including the National Nuclear Regulator, perform regulatory functions relating to exploration and mining of uranium in Sou th Africa.  \nAccording to the Mineral Resources and Development Act No.  28 of 2002, an applicant of \nprospecting or mining right must make the prescribed financial provision for the rehabilitation \nor management of negative environmental impacts before the app roval of such rights. If the \nholder of the prospecting or mining right fails to rehabilitate, or is unable to undertake such \nrehabilitation, then part or all of the financial provision will be used for rehabilitation. The \nholder of a prospecting or mining right must annually assess their environmental liabilities and \naccordingly increase their financial provision to the satisfaction of the Minister of Mineral \nResources. If the minister is not satisfied with the assessment and the financial provision, the \nminister may appoint an independent assessor to conduct the assessment and determine the \nfinancial provision. The requirement to maintain and retain the financial provision remains in \nforce until a closure certificate has been issued after the closure of min ing or prospecting \noperation. The minister may still retain a portion of the financial provision as may be required \nto rehabilitate the closed mining or prospecting operation in respect of latent or residual \nenvironmental impacts. No closure certificate will be issued until the rehabilitation has been \ndone and the chief inspector, as well as all the governmental regulatory departments related to \nuranium exploration and mining, have confirmed that the provisions pertaining to health, safety, environment and management of potential pollution to water have been addressed.  \nUranium requirements  \nKoeberg is South Africa’s only nuclear power plant. It has two light -water thermal reactors: \nKoeberg I, commissioned in 1984, and Koeberg II, commissioned in 1985, with a combined \ninstalled capacity of 1  840 MW. Together, they require about 294 tU/yr.  \nNATIONAL REPORTS: SOUTH AFRICA  \n456 URA NIUM 202 2: RESOURCES, PRODUCTION AND DEMAND, NEA No. 7634, © OECD 202 3 In August 2018, the government announced that it had abandoned plans to build up to \n9.6 GWe of new nuclear capacity by 2030. The Integrated Resources Plan (IRP) 2018, an updat e of \nthat issued in 2010, did not include any new nuclear capacity by 2030. IRP 2010 had outlined a \nrequired 52 GWe of new capacity by 2030, with nuclear to provide at least 9.6 GWe of that. An update to the IRP issued in November 2016 called for 1.4 GWe o f new nuclear capacity by 2037, \nand a total of 20 GWe long term. IRP 2016 was released in the context of the Integrated Energy Plan \n(IEP), which projected a more than threefold increase in electricity demand by 2050.  \nIn May 2020, the Department of Mineral Resources and Energy  of South Africa stated that it \nwas to begin working on a roadmap for the construction of 2.5  GWe of new nuclear capacity. It \nis to consider all options, including small modular reactors.  \nUranium policies, uranium stocks and uranium prices  \nNational policies relating to uranium  \nThe National Nuclear Regulator Act No.  47 of 1999, the Nuclear Energy Act No.  46 of 1999, National \nRadioactive Waste Disposal Institute Act No. 53 of 2008, and the Mineral and Petroleum Resources \nDevelopment Act No.  28 of 2002, are the basis of national policies relating to prospecting for and \nmining of uranium in South Africa, as well as the export of uranium and disposal of spent nuclear \nfuel.

The initial targets were the Hercynia n granites of western Spain. In 1957 and 1958, \nthe first occurrences in Precambrian -Cambrian schists were discovered, including the Fe \ndeposit in the province of Salamanca. In 1965, exploration of sedimentary rocks began and the \nMazarete deposit in Guadalajara province was discovered. In 1972, the Empresa Nacional del \nUranio S.A., today Enusa Industrias Avanzadas S.A., S.M.E. (hereinafter ENUSA), a state -owned \ncompany, was established to take charge of all the nuclear fuel cycle front -end activities. Its \nshareholders are the Sociedad Estatal de Participaciones Industriales (SEPI), holding 60% of the \ncapital, and the Centro de Investigaciones Energéticas Medioambientales y Tecnológicas \n(CIEMAT, previously JEN), with the remaining 40%. Exploration activities b y ENUSA ended in \n1992. Joint venture exploration between ENUSA and other companies continued until the end \nof 1994. During this period, most of the Spanish territory was surveyed using a variety of methods, adapted to different stages of exploration, and a mple airborne and ground radiometric \ncoverage of the most interesting areas was achieved.  \nRecent and ongoing uranium exploration and mine development activities  \nBerkeley Minera España S.L.U. (hereinafter Berkeley) was granted one mining licence in the \nprov ince of Salamanca (covering 2  520 ha) and a total of 26 investigation licences (covering a total \nof 94  555 ha), as well as one exploration licence covering 19  570 ha spanning the provinces of \nSalamanca, Cáceres and Badajoz. This company has been actively e xploring for uranium for \nseveral years, with a focus on several historically known uranium projects located within their \ntenements.  \nBerkeley’s Salamanca Project comprises the Retortillo, Zona 7 and Alameda deposits (in \nSalamanca province) and also the Gamb uta deposit in Cáceres province, which now, according \nto Berkeley, accounts for 12.3  Mlb U 3O8 (4 730 tU) in the measured and 47.5  Mlb U 3O8 (18 270 tU) \nin the indicated resource categories, with an additional 29.5 Mlb U 3O8 (11 350 tU) in the inferred \nresour ce category. All deposits are the granite -related type (perigranitic subtype), hosted by a \nsequence of metasediments which are adjacent to a granite intrusion.  \nAccording to the company, Retortillo, Alameda and Zona 7 would achieve a production \ncapacity of  4.4 Mlb U 3O8/yr (1 690 tU/yr) over a mine life of 14 years.  \nUranium resources  \nIdentified conventional resources (reasonably assured and inferred resources)  \nTotal reported in situ identified resources are 89.3  Mlb U 3O8 (34 350 tU), which include 59.8 Mlb \nU3O8 (23 000 tU) in the reasonably assured category (12.3  Mlb U3O8 or 4 730 tU as measured \nresources and 47.5  Mlb U3O8 or 18  270 tU as indicated resources) and 29.5  Mlb U 3O8 (11 350 tU) as \ninferred. All resources are reported as in situ and mineable by conv entional open pit. According \nto the feasibility study 95% of resources may be recovered by open -pit mining and 87% factor is \napplied for processing recovery. The overall recovery factor is about 83%.  \nNATIONAL REPORTS: SPAIN  \n462 URA NIUM 202 2: RESOURCES, PRODUCTION AND DEMAND, NEA No. 7634, © OECD 202 3 Uranium production  \nHistorical review  \nProduction started in 1959 at the Andújar plant (Jaén province) and continued until 1981. The \nDon Benito plant (Badajoz province) remained in operation from 1983 to 1990. Production at the \nFe mine (Salamanca province) started in 1975 with heap leaching (Elefante plant). A new \ndynamic leaching plant (Quercus) started operation in 1993 and was shut down in December \n2000. The licence for the definitive shutdown of production, submitted to regulatory authorities in December 2002, was approved in July 2003.  \nStatus of production capability  \nMining activities were terminated in December 2000 with the closure of Saelices el Chico \nuranium mines and production of uranium concentrates ended in November 2002 when the \nassociated Quercus processing plant was shut down.  \nA decommissioning pla n was presented to the regulatory authorities in 2005. However, it was \nput on standby a first time due to the need to decommission the former Elefante processing plant \nand restore mines at the same site before decommissioning Quercus, and then a second tim e in \n2009 due to an agreement between ENUSA and Berkeley to complete a feasibility study on the \nstate reserves in Salamanca province. Despite these delays, once the Elefante processing plant \nwas decommissioned, the mines were restored and the agreement bet ween ENUSA and Berkeley \nwas finalised, a new plan for decommissioning was presented to the regulatory authorities in September 2015. This plan has been subject to several additional information requirements since 2016 and is still being evaluated by the na tional regulatory body.  \nIn 2019 and 2020, the relevant authorities continued evaluating permits and approvals \nrequired to authorise the construction of the Berkeley´s mine.  \nOwnership structure of the uranium industry  \nQuercus, the only production facility in Spain still pending decommissioning, belongs to the company ENUSA.  \nEmployment in the uranium industry  \nThere is no uranium production in Spain. Since there are no existing production centres, employment is associated with decommissioning and mine developm ent activities only.  \nEmployment at the former Fe mine totalled 25 at the end of 2020. All of these workers are \ndedicated to the mining restoration, monitoring and decommissioning programmes.  \nBerkeley has between 15 and 20 employees, depending on the activi ty being carried out. \nBerkeley’s activity is focused on the project development of the Salamanca Project, pending several authorisations.  \nFuture production centres  \nBerkeley announced its intention to bring four potential open -pit uranium mines into product ion: \nRetortillo- Santidad, Alameda, Zona 7 and Gambuta (the former three in the Salamanca region and \nthe latter in the Cáceres region). Berkeley applied to the competent authority (autonomous regional government) for an exploitation permit for the Retortillo -Santidad mining project in \nOctober 2011, and the mining licence was granted in April 2014 once the Environmental Licence \nwas in place and after a favourable report from the Nuclear Safety Council. In March 2012, \naccording to the nuclear regulations, Berk eley requested site authorisation for the radioactive \nfacility to the Ministry in charge of energy issues (currently the Ministry for the Ecologic Transition \nand the Demographic Challenge, MITERD), which was granted by September 2015 after a \nfavourable rep ort of the Nuclear Safety Council. This allowed Berkeley to request construction \nauthorisation.  \nNATIONAL REPORTS: SPAIN  \nURANIUM 202 2: RESOURCES, PRODUCTION AND DEMAND, NEA No. 7634, ©  OECD 20 23 463 In July 2021, the Spanish Nuclear Safety Council (CSN) issued a negative report on the construction \nlicence for the processing plant. The report is mandatory, and when negative or regarding the \nconditions imposed, it is binding for action to be taken by the Ministry for the Ecological \nTransition and the Demographic Challenge (MITECO), who are in charge of granting construction licen ces. Consequently, MITECO rejected Berkeley Energia ’s authorisation to build \na uranium proc essing plant at the company ’s Salamanca project in western Spain.  \nSecondary sources of uranium  \nSpain reports mixed oxide fuel, re -enriched tails and reprocessed uranium production and use \nas zero.  \nEnvironmental activit ies and socio -cultural issues  \nThe conditions of the former uranium production facilities in Spain are as follows:  \n• Fábrica de Uranio de Andújar (Jaén province): Mill and tailings piles have been closed and \nremediated, with an ongoing ten -year surveillance and control programme (groundwater \nquality, erosion control, infiltration and radon control). This programme has been \nextended.  \n• Mine and plant “LOBO- G” (Badajoz province): The open -pit and mill tailings dump have \nbeen closed and remediated, with a surveilla nce and control programme (groundwater \nquality, erosion control, infiltration and radon control) in place until 2004. A long -term \nstewardship and monitoring programme was begun after the declaration of closure.  \n• Old mines (Andalucía and Extremadura regions): Underground and open -pit mines were \nrestored, with work completed in 2000.  \n• Two old mines in Salamanca (Valdemascaño and Casillas de Flores) were restored in 2007, following which a surveillance programme was initiated, ending in 2011. Results were evaluated by regulatory authorities and it was determined that an extension of the surveillance period was required.  \n• Elefante plant (Salamanca province): The decommissioning plan, including industrial facilities and heap leaching piles, was approved by regulator y authorities in January 2001. \nThe plant was dismantled, and ore stockpiles were levelled and covered in 2004. A monitoring and control programme has been in place since 2005.  \n• In 2004, the mining restoration plan of the open -pit exploitation in Saelices el  Chico \n(Salamanca province) was approved by regulatory authorities. Implementation of this \nplan was finished in 2008 and the proposed surveillance and control programme was \nsent to regulatory authorities for approval. A monitoring and control programme has  \nbeen in place since then.  \n• Quercus plant (Salamanca province): Mining activities ended in December 2000 and uranium processing in November 2002. A decommissioning plan was submitted to regulatory authorities in 2005. However, because of the need for the decommissioning of the former Elefante processing plant and for the restoration of some of the mines at the \nsame site before turning to the decommissioning of Quercus, as well as the 2009 agreement \nbetween ENUSA and Berkeley, this decommissioning plan was pu t on standby. In \nSeptember 2015 a new plan for decommissioning was presented to the regulatory \nauthorities, which after several additional information requirements (corrections \nsubmitted in 2017 and 2020), is still pending approval. During this time, a sur veillance and \nmaintenance programme has remained active for the plant and associated facilities.  \nUranium mining regulatory regime  \nIn Spain, the mining regime is regulated by the Mines Act (Act 22/1973), modified by Act  54/1980, \nand by Royal Decree 2857/1978. The investigation and use of radioactive ores is governed by this \nact in those areas that are not specifically considered in the Nuclear Energy Act (Act  25/1964), \nNATIONAL REPORTS: SPAIN  \n464 URA NIUM 202 2: RESOURCES, PRODUCTION AND DEMAND, NEA No. 7634, © OECD 202 3 Chapter IV of which deals with the prospecting, investigation and use of radioactive ores,  as \nwell as the commercialisation of such ores and their concentrates.  \nAccording to Article 2 of the Mines Act, all -natural deposits and other geological resources \nin Spain are assets belonging to the public domain, investigation and use of which may be \nundertaken directly by the state or assigned in accordance with the rules. Pursuant to Article  1 \nof Act 54/1980, which amends the Mines Act, radioactive ores are part of Section D, i.e.  resources \nof national energy interest.  \nPursuant to Article 19 of the Nuc lear Energy Act, the prospecting, investigation and use of \nradioactive ores and the obtaining of concentrates are declared to be open throughout the entire national territory, except in those areas set aside by the state. Individuals or companies who wish to prospect for radioactive ores are required to request an investigation permit from the state and subsequently, if the existence of one or more resources open to rational exploitation is revealed, \nto request an exploitation licence. This licence confers the right to exploit the resources and is \ngranted for a 30 -year period, extendable by similar periods of time to a maximum of 90  years. The \npermits and licences are granted by the autonomous communities, in keeping with the transfer \nto them of state competences in mining and energy issues, except when the mining activity in \nquestion affects several autonomous communities or state reserves, in which case the competent authority is the Ministry for the Ecological Transition and the Demographic Challenge (MITE RD), \nby virtue of the Mines Act.  \nThe Nuclear Safety Council is the organisation responsible for nuclear safety and radiological \nprotection. In accordance with Article 2 of the act creating the Nuclear Safety Council (Act  15/1980), \none of the main competenc es of the Council is to issue reports to the MITERD on nuclear safety \nand radiological protection, prior to the resolutions adopted by the latter regarding the granting \nof authorisations for the operation, restoration or closure of uranium mines and produc tion \nfacilities. These reports are mandatory in all cases and binding when negative in their findings or denying authorisation, or as regards to the conditions established when they are positive.  \nRegarding restoration plans and financial guarantees for the  mining activities, according to \nthe Royal Decree 975/2009 of 12 June on the management of waste resulting from extractive \nindustries and the protection and restoration of the environment affected by mining activities, a restoration plan must be submitted for approval to the mining authority (the autonomous regional government or MITERD, in the case of those mining activities affecting several autonomous communities or state reserves), the approval of which will be given together with \nthe granting of the ex ploitation licence. The mining authority will neither grant the licence nor \napprove the plan unless environmental restoration of the site is guaranteed. To that end, two \nfinancial guaranties must be set up by the company before starting any mining activity. One \nmust be set up for the rehabilitation of the environment affected by the exploitation of the ores \nand the second for the management of the generated waste. Both must comply with the \nobjectives and conditions established in the authorised restoration plan even in the case that \nthe company does not exist at the time of the restoration.  \nDecommissioning of the associated milling facilities is pursuant to the Regulation on \nNuclear and Radioactive Installations (RINR, approved by Royal Decree 1836/1999 and modified \nseveral times afterwards). As radioactive facilities of the nuclear fuel cycle, these facilities are \nsubject to all previous site, construction and exploitation licences. An exploitation licence \nrequires the applicant to submit decommissioning and  closure forecasts, including, among \nother things, the final management of the radioactive wastes as well as the economic and \nfinancial calculations to guarantee closure of the site. The RINR requires the constitution of a \nfinancial guarantee before granti ng an exploitation licence.  \nThe Climate Change Law 7/2021 of 20 May on climate change and the energy transition aims \nto ensure the nation’s compliance with the objectives of the Paris Agreement. It includes a \nsection regarding uranium mining and milling fa cilities in Spain. No new permits to exploit \nradioactive mineral deposits will be admitted after the entry into force of the Law , which came \ninto effect in May 2021.  \nNATIONAL REPORTS: SPAIN  \nURANIUM 202 2: RESOURCES, PRODUCTION AND DEMAND, NEA No. 7634, ©  OECD 20 23 465 Uranium requirement s \nAs of 31 December 2020, the net capacity of the seven Spanish nuclear reactors under commercial \noperation (Almaraz units 1 and 2, Ascó units 1 and 2, Cofrentes, Vandellós 2 and Trillo nuclear \npower plants) was about 7.1 GWe. No new reactors are expected to be built in the near future.  \nIn 2020 the Spanish government approved licence renewals for Almaraz unit  1 until 2027, \nAlmaraz unit 2 until 2028 and Vandellós unit 2 until 2030.  \nDuring the first quarter of 2021, the lone Cofrentes unit’s licence was ren ewed until 2030 \nand a similar decision is expected from the corresponding authorities concerning the requested \nrenewal of both Ascó units I and II for another nine and ten years, respectively. In 2014, the \nTrillo nuclear power plant received its renewal for operation until 2024.  \nThese renewals of the nuclear power plant licences and their terms were requested and \nauthorised in line with the Comprehensive National Energy and Climate Plan 2021 -2030. This \nplan forecasts the evolution of nuclear energy’s contr ibution to the energy mix according to the \nsubsequent Protocol signed in March 2019 by the electric companies and ENRESA agreeing to a \nscheduled closure of the nuclear power plants during the period 2027 -2035.  \nAccordingly, for the coming years, uranium re quirements for the Spanish nuclear fleet will \nrange from 900 to 1  550 tU/yr, decreasing once the closure dates approach.  \nSupply and procurement strategy  \nAll uranium procurement activities are carried out by ENUSA on behalf of the Spanish utilities that ow n the seven  nuclear reactors under commercial operation in Spain.  \nUranium policies, uranium stocks and uranium prices  \nNational policies relating to uranium  \nSpain’s uranium import policy provides for diversification of supply. The Spanish legislation leaves  uranium exploration and production open to national and foreign companies.  \nUranium stocks  \nSpanish regulation provides that a strategic uranium inventory contained in enriched uranium \nshould be held jointly by the utilities that own nuclear power plants. T he current stock contains \nthe equivalent of at least 608 tU. Additional inventories could be maintained depending on \nuranium market conditions.  \nUranium exploration and development expenditures and drilling effort  – domestic  \n(EUR)  \n 2018 2019 2020 2021 (expe cted)  \nIndustry* exploration expenditures  784 530  785 918  253 749  341 700  \nTotal expenditures  784 530  785 918  253 749  341 700  \nIndustry* exploration drilling (m)  0 0 0 3 350  \nIndustry* exploration holes drilled  0 0 0 13 \nTotal drilling (m)  0 0 0 3 350  \nTotal number of holes drilled  0 0 0 13 \n* Non -government.  \nNATIONAL REPORTS: SPAIN  \n466 URA NIUM 202 2: RESOURCES, PRODUCTION AND DEMAND, NEA No. 7634, © OECD 202 3 Reasonably assured conventional resources by production method  \n(in situ tonnes  U) \nProduction method  <USD 40/kgU  <USD 80/kgU  <USD 130/kgU  <USD 260/kgU  Recovery \nfactor (%) \nOpen -pit mining (OP)  9 800 23 000 23 000  23 000  83 \nTotal  9 800 23 000  23 000  23 000  83 \nReasonably assured conventional resources by processing method  \n(in situ tonnes  U) \nProcessing method  <USD 40/kgU  <USD 80/kgU  <USD 130/kgU  <USD 260/kgU  Recovery \nfactor (%) \nConventional from OP  9 800 23 000  23 000  23 000  83 \nTotal  9 800 23 000  23 000  23 000  83 \nReasonably assured conventional resources by deposit type  \n(in situ tonnes  U) \nDeposit type  <USD 40/kgU  <USD 80/kgU  <USD 130/kgU  <USD 260/kgU  \nGranite -related  9 800 23 000  23 000  23 000  \nTotal  9 800 23 000  23 000  23 000  \nInferred resources by production method  \n(in situ tonnes  U) \nProduction method  <USD 40/kgU  <USD 80/kgU  <USD 130/kgU  <USD 260/kgU  Recovery \nfactor (%) \nOpen -pit mining (OP)  0 11 350  11 350  11 350  83 \nTotal  0 11 350  11 350  11 350  83 \nInferred resources by processing method  \n(in situ tonnes  U) \nProcessing method  <USD 40/kgU  <USD 80/kgU  <USD 130/kgU  <USD 260/kgU  Recovery \nfactor (%) \nConventional from OP  0 11 350  11 350  11 350  83 \nTotal  0 11 350  11 350  11 350  83 \nInferred resources by deposi t type  \n(in situ tonnes  U) \nDeposit type  <USD 40/kgU  <USD 80/kgU  <USD 130/kgU  <USD 260/kgU  \nGranite -related  0 11 350  11 350  11 350  \nTotal  0 11 350  11 350  11 350  \n \nNATIONAL REPORTS: SPAIN  \nURANIUM 202 2: RESOURCES, PRODUCTION AND DEMAND, NEA No. 7634, ©  OECD 20 23 467 Historical uranium production by production method  \n(tonnes U in concentrates)  \nProduction method  Total through \nend of 2018  2019 2020 Total through \nend of 2020  2021(expected)  \nOpen -pit mining* 5 028  0 0 5 028  0 \nTotal  5 028  0 0 5 028  0 \n* Pre -2018 totals may include uranium recovered by heap and in -place leaching.  \nHistorical uranium production by proc essing method  \n(tonnes U in concentrates)  \nProcessing method  Total through \nend of 2018 2019 2020 Total through \nend of 2020  2021 (expected)  \nConventional  4 961  0 0 4 961  0 \nOther methods*  67 0 0 67 0 \nTotal  5 028  0 0 5 028  0 \n* Includes mine water treatment a nd environmental restoration.  \nHistorical uranium production by deposit type  \n(tonnes U in concentrates)  \nDeposit type  Total through \nend of 2018  2019 2020 Total through \nend of 2020  2021 (expected)  \nGranite -related  5 028  0 0 5 028  0 \nTotal  5 028  0 0 5 028  0 \nUranium industry employment at existing production centres * \n(person -years)  \n 2018 2019 2020 2021 (expected)  \nTotal employment related to existing production centres  79 79 42 42 \nEmployment directly related to uranium production  0 0 0 0 \n* Since there are no existing production centres in Spain, employment is related to decommissioning and mine development activities \nonly.

The first general evaluation of the uranium potential of Tanzania was a country -wide \nairborne geophysical survey for the government between 1976 and 1979. Results revealed many \nradiometric anomalies in a variety of geological settings.  \nA uranium exploration programme was subsequently carried out by Uranerzbergbau GmbH \nbetween 1978 and 1983 but ended because of declinin g uranium prices. The targets of this survey \nwere anomalies in the Karoo, in younger surficial sediments, in phosphatic sediments of the \nPleistocene age and carbonatite of the Gallapo. Numerous occurrences of surface uranium \nmineralisation were identified and there is potential for several uranium deposit types in the \ncountry.  \nInterest in uranium exploration was revived after the rise of uranium prices in 2007 and the \nTanzanian government issued over 70 licences. Major exploration activities were focused on  the \nidentification of sandstone -type uranium deposits in the Karoo Basin in the southern part of \nthe country and surficial -type deposits in the central part of the country.  \nSince 2007, three companies discovered four uranium deposits and identified JORC a nd \nNI-43/101 compliant uranium resources (measured, indicated and inferred), as presented in the \ntable below. Total in situ resources amounted to 72  756 tU, including 49  596 tU in the measured \nand indicated categories.  \nIn situ uranium resources of Tanzania  (UDEPO, 2013*; company reports)  \nDeposit name  Resources (tU)  Grade  \n(% U)  Estimated \nin Type  Subtype  Current owner  Measured \n+ indicated  Inferred  \nLikuyu North   2 346  0.020  2011  Sandstone  Tabular  Uranex NL  \nManyoni (Bahi)  1 669  9 477  0.012  2010  Surfi cial Lacustrine -\nplaya  Uranex NL  \nMtonya   775 0.022  2013  Sandstone  Tabular/  \nroll-front  Uranium \nResources Inc.  \nNyota (Mkuju \nRiver)  47 927  10 562  0.026  2013  Sandstone  Tabular  Mantra/  \nUranium One  \n* World Distribution of Uranium Deposits (UDEPO) –  https://infcis.iaea.org/UDEPO/About .   \nNote: The largest deposit so far is the Nyota deposit, part of the Mantra/Uranium One Mkuju River Project.   \n \nOver 80% of the total resources relate to the large Nyota sandstone -type deposit, also known \nas the Mkuju River Project. The systematic exploration at Nyota started in 2007 and in 2009 a \nmaiden inferred resource estimate of 13 800 tU (35.9 Mlbs  U3O8) and a pre -feasibility study were \nreleased.

An update of the in situ resources of the Nyota \ndeposit estimate in September 2011 boosted total in situ resources to 45  924 tU (119.4 Mlbs  U3O8) \nand form ed the basis of a feasibility study. During 2012 and 2013, Mantra Resources continued \nexploration focused on new resource estimates and engineering optimisation.   \nDrilling activities and analysis of historical data resulted in a further increase in in situ  \nresources in June 2013 to 58 489 tU (152.1 Mlbs  U3O8), including 124.6 Mlbs  U3O8 (47 927 tU) in the \nmeasured and indicated categories at an average grade of 303  ppm  U3O8 (0.0257%  U). The Mkuju \nRiver feasibility study was completed in 2013 and the Tanzanian government issued a special \nmining licence (SML) to Mantra for project development. During 2013 -2014, the main exploration \nactivities of Mantra Resources focused on verifying Nyota deposit resources and on -site push -pull \ntesting to identify amenability of the principal mineralisation to in situ leaching (ISL) mining.  \nExploration drilling by Uranex at the Likuyu North deposit during 2009 -2012 identified maiden \nresources of 6.1 Mlb U3O8 (2 346 tU) with an average grade of 237 ppm  U3O8 (0.02%  U) reported at  a \n100 ppm  U3O8 (0.0085%  U) cut -off grade .  \nIn 2010, Uranex reported resources of 11 146 tU in a shallow Manyoni deposit, also known \nas the Bahi project. The region incorporates an extensive closed draining system developed over weathered uranium -rich gran ites. This drainage captures dissolved uranium leached from \nunderlying rocks and transports it to suitable precipitation trap sites (playa lakes). The Manyoni \nProject encompasses up to five playa lakes.  \nUranium Resources Plc in 2013 announced maiden resou rces of 3.6  Mt ore containing \n2.014 Mlb U\n3O8 (775 tU) at a grade of 255 ppm  U3O8 (0.00216%  U) at the Mtonya deposit. The \nuranium mineralisation occurs at depths of 350  m in continuous 30 - to 50 -metre -wide roll fronts. \nThe resource is potentially amenable t o the in situ leach recovery mining method.  \nRecent and ongoing uranium exploration and mine development activities  \nAfter 2015, only Mantra Resources continued limited exploration activities at the Nyota deposit . \nDuring 2015 -2017, exploration was  focused o n additional investigations to test  the amenability \nof the ISL  extraction of resources. The laboratory tests resulted in high uranium recoveries with \nacceptable values of uranium content in sulphuric acid solutions, acid consumption and liquid -\nto-solid rat io. The results of the hydrogeological test confirmed good aquifer permeability. The \non-site ISL test was conducted over  ten months in 2016 using a two-well pattern  and the final \nreport was issued in 2017. The results confirmed the amenability of  ISL minin g for the portion  \nof the resources located below the water table.  During 2017, rehabilitation of aquifers and the \nsurface was completed after ISL tests.  \nIn December 2016, Mantra Resources applied to the Ministry of Energy and Minerals (MEM) for \na suspension of the special mining licence and the associated work programme due to the state \nof the uranium market, and the MEM accepted an 18 -month suspension of the planned activities. \nDuring 2017- 2019, further development of Mkuju River was suspended due to unfa vourable \nuranium market conditions. In 2020, Mantra Resources decided to build a pilot processing plant \nduring 2021- 2022 and to proceed with a small -scale pilot open -pit mining operation during  \n2023- 2025. Annual pilot plant capacity of 15  000 t of ore assumes production of 5tU/yr.  \nIn mid -2021, Australian company Gladiator Resources Ltd agreed to acquire Zeus Resources \nLtd and granted Tanzanian tenements known as the Minjingu, Mkuju, Liwale, Foxy and Eland \nuranium projects. Uranium resources have yet to be defined in these projects and Gladiator \nplans to conduct a thorough review of the project’s historical data to define future exploration \nprogrammes and drill targets.  \nNo other companies have reported uranium -related exploration activities in Tanzania since  \n2017.  \nIdentified conventional resources (reasonably assured and inferred resources)  \nThere are no changes in Tanzanian uranium resources since the previous report. Total identified \nin situ uranium resources from four deposits in Tanzania amount to 72  756 tU. Over 80% of the \ntotal relates to the Nyota sandstone deposit at the Mkuju River Project, which contains 47  927 tU \nof in situ measured and indicated resources and 10  562 tU of inferred resources, all in the \nNATIO NAL REPORTS: TANZANIA  \nURANIUM 202 2: RESOURCES, PRODUCTION AND DEMAND, NEA No. 7634, ©  OECD 20 23 471 <USD  80/kgU cost category. The Manyoni playa la ke calcrete deposits make up 11 146 tU of \nidentified resources, of which 9  477 tU are inferred. The remaining inferred resources include two \nsandstone -type deposits: Likuju North with 2  346 tU and the Mtonya deposit, which comprises \n775 tU and is potential ly amenable to ISL extraction. An 80% recovery factor was applied to convert \nall in situ resources into recoverable resources.  \nUndiscovered conventional resources (prognosticated and speculative resources)  \nUndiscovered resources are not reported. There is , however, a high potential for sandstone -type \nuranium deposits in Karoo sediments in several areas of Tanzania.  \nUranium production  \nThere has been no uranium produced in Tanzania.  \nFuture production centres  \nThe Mkuju River feasibility study was completed in  2013 and the Tanzanian government issued \nan SML to Mantra for project development. Front -end engineering and design (FEED) and Pre -\nFEED initiatives continued until June 2014.  \nAccording to the current definitive feasibility study, the resources will be mined in multiple \npits feeding a single mill with conventional acid leach and resin -in-pulp recovery. Sulphuric \nacid ISL mining may be employed, particularly for about 15% of resources lying outside designed \npits and below the water table. One -third of the total resource is situated below the water table, \nso the ISL potential could be greater.  \nUranium production centre technical details  \n(as of 1  January 2021)  \n Centre #1  \nName of production centre  Mkuju River \nProduction centre classification  Prospective  \nDate of first production (year)  NA \nSource of ore:   \nDeposit name(s)  Nyota  \nDeposit type(s)  Sandstone  \nRecoverable resources (tU)  31 700  \nGrade (% U)  0.0425  \nMining operation:   \nType (OP/UG/ISL) OP \nSize (tonnes ore/day)  18 000  \nAverage mining recovery (%)  90 \nProcessing plant:   \nAcid/alkaline  Acid  \nType (IX/SX)  Resin -in-pulp  \nSize (tonnes ore/day)  \nFor ISL (mega or kilolitre/day or litre/hour, specify)  18 000  \nAverage process recovery (%)  85 \nNominal production capacity (tU/year)  3 000  \nPlans for expansion (y es/no)  no \nOther remarks  ISL option not assumed  \nNATIONAL REPORTS: TANZANIA  \n472 URA NIUM 202 2: RESOURCES, PRODUCTION AND DEMAND, NEA No. 7634, © OECD 202 3 Activities at the project during 2015 and 2016 focused on an ISL pilot test programme. ISL \ncould prove to be an alternative extraction method for the Mkuju River Project and similar ore \nbodies in the region . \nIn late December 2016, Mantra Resources applied to the Ministry of Energy and Minerals of \nTanzania (MEM) for suspension of its SML due to the unfavourable uranium market. In September \n2017, the Ministry approved an amendment to the SML, which permits construction work to start \nin 2020. During 2018 and 2019, Mantra Resources and MEM negotiated a further suspension of the SML. Development of the project was postponed until uranium demand increases.  \nEnvironmental activities and socio -cultural issues  \nThe Tanz anian government has worked to allay public concerns over the prospect of uranium \nmining. The environmental, health, economic and social impacts are to be carefully considered \nand the government indicated that it is aware of the high safety standards requi red for uranium \nmining in order to protect people and the environment.  \nElephant poachers have taken advantage of the road constructed for access to the Mkuju \nRiver uranium project, located in the area excised from the Selous Game Reserve. In May 2014, \nthe operator entered into a memorandum of understanding with the Ministry of Natural \nResources and Tourism to conduct combined anti -poaching initiatives. The UNESCO World \nHeritage Committee is monitoring the situation since all of its demands must be met in or der \nto fulfil the Mkuju River Project requirements.  \nNational policies relating to uranium  \nIn 2010, the Tanzanian government substantially amended the Mining Act of 1998. The revised act increased royalty payments for mineral extraction on the gross value o f minerals produced \n(from 3% to 5% for uranium) and mandated the government the ability to acquire shareholdings in future mining projects through a development agreement negotiated between the government and the mineral rights holder. The Parliamentary Co mmittee for Energy and Minerals in Tanzania \nhas directed that no mining of uranium can take place until a policy and legislation on extraction \nare in place.  \nThe International Atomic Energy Agency conducted a Uranium Production Site Appraisal \nTeam review in  2013, providing recommendations to the country, a newcomer to uranium mining, \nin the application of international good practices and preparations for planned uranium mining \nactivities. The scope of the appraisal process included exploration, resource asse ssment, planning, \nenvironmental and social impact assessment, mining, processing, waste management, site management, remediation and final closure.  \nReasonably assured conventional resources by production method  \n(recoverable tonnes  U) \nProduction method  <USD  40/kgU  <USD 80/kgU  <USD 130/kgU  <USD 260/kgU  Recovery factor (%)  \nOpen -pit mining (OP)  0 38 342  39 677  39 677  80 \nTotal  0 38 342  39 677  39 677  80 \nReasonably assured conventional resources by processing method  \n(recoverable tonnes  U) \nProcessing method  <USD  40/kgU  <USD 80/kgU  <USD 130/kgU  <USD 260/kgU  Recovery factor (%)  \nConventional from OP  0 38 342  39 677  39 677  80 \nTotal  0 38 342  39 677  39 677  80 \nNATIO NAL REPORTS: TANZANIA  \nURANIUM 202 2: RESOURCES, PRODUCTION AND DEMAND, NEA No. 7634, ©  OECD 20 23 473 Reasonably assured conventional resources by deposit type  \n(recoverable tonnes  U) \nDeposit type  <USD 40/kgU  <USD 80/kgU  <USD 130/kgU  <USD 260/kgU  \nSandstone  0 38 342  38 342   38 342   \nSurficial  0 0 1 335  1 335  \nTotal  0 38 342  39 677  39 677  \nInferred conventional resources by production method  \n(recoverable tonnes  U) \nProduction method  <USD 40/kgU  <USD 80/kgU  <USD 1 30/kgU  <USD 260/kgU  Recovery factor (%)  \nOpen -pit mining (OP)  0 8 450  17 908  17 908  80 \nIn situ leaching acid  0 0 620  620  80 \nTotal  0 8 450  18 528  18 528  80 \nInferred conventional resources by processing method  \n(recoverable tonnes  U) \nProcessing method  <USD  40/kgU  <USD 80/kgU  <USD 130/kgU  <USD 260/kgU  Recovery factor (%)  \nConventional from OP  0 8 450  17 908  17 908  80 \nIn situ leaching acid  0 0 620 620 80 \nTotal  0 8 450  18 528  18 528  80 \nInferred conventional resources by deposit type  \n(recoverable tonnes  U) \nDeposit type  <USD 40/kgU  <USD 80/kgU  <USD 130/kgU  <USD 260/kgU  \nSandstone  0 8 450  10 946   10 946  \nSurficial  0  7 582  7 582  \nTotal  0 8 450  18 528  18 528  \nShort -term production capability  \n(tonnes U/year)  \n2020  2025  \nA-I B-I A-II B-II A-I B-I A-II B-II \n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 \n \n2030  2035  2040  \nA-I B-I A-II B-II A-I B-I A-II B-II A-I B-I A-II B-II \n0 0 0 0 0 2 000  0 2 000  0 NA 0 3 000  \n \nNATIONAL REPORTS: TÜRKIYE  \n474 URA NIUM 202 2: RESOURCES, PRODUCTION AND DEMAND, NEA No. 7634, © OECD 202 3 Türkiye \nUranium exploration and mine development  \nHistorical background  \nUranium exploration in Türkiye began in 1956 -1957 and was direc ted towards the discovery of \nvein -type deposits in crystalline terrain, such as acidic igneous and metamorphic rocks. As a \nresult of these activities, some uneconomic occurrences of pitchblende mineralisation were \nfound. Since 1960, studies have been condu cted in sedimentary rocks that surround the \ncrystalline rocks, and some small orebodies containing autunite and torbernite mineralisation \nhave been found in various parts of the country. In the mid -1970s, the first uranium deposit was \nfound in the Kopruba şı area of Manisa, consisting of black coloured ore located below the water \ntable. After 2010, the Avanos -Gülşehir and Malatya- Kuluncak uranium fields were discovered \nby the General Directorate of Mineral Research and Exploration (MTA). Resources increased after intensive exploration and drilling operations by the MTA and the private sector.  \nThe state -owned organisation, General Directorate of Eti Mining Operations (Eti Maden), is \nresponsible for the exploration and development activities of five uranium de posits with \nidentified resources. The MTA has performed geological exploration at these sites in the past. \nBetween 1960 and 1980, uranium exploration included aerial prospecting, general and detailed \nprospecting, geologic mapping and drilling. The uranium deposits were transferred from the MTA to Eti Maden as potential mines, which can be operated by the state under Law No.  2840, \n“Operation of Boron Salts, Trona and Asphaltite Mines and Nuclear Energy Raw Materials”, issued on 10 June 1983.  \nRecent and ongoi ng uranium exploration and mine development activities  \nIn 2017, granite, acidic igneous and sedimentary rocks around Edirne, Kırklareli, and Tekirda ğ \n(an area of approximately 3  000 km2) were explored for radioactive raw materials. Exploration was \nalso performed in sites licensed by the MTA inside Nev şehir and Aydın.  \nIn 2018, granite, acidic igneous and sedimentary rocks  around Edirne, Kırklareli, and Tekirda ğ \n(an area of approximately 3  460 km2) were explored for radioactive raw materials. Exploration was \nalso performed in sites licensed by the MTA in the Nev şehir and Ç anakkale provinces.  \nIn 2019, granite, acidic igneous  and sedimentary rocks around the Thrace Basin (Edirne, \nKırklareli and Tekirda ğ provinces), Çanakkale, Nevş ehir, Giresun and Ayd ın provinces were \nexplored for radioactive raw materials. Drilling was conducted at sites licensed by the MTA inside \nthe Thrace Basin, Nevş ehir and Çanakkale provinces.  \nThe MTA initiated a drilling programme to confirm previous work and develop ore resources \nat the Manisa- Köprüba şı exploration site. As of 11  July 2019, a total of 12 203 m of drilling had been \ncarried out in 135 dr ill holes, including 2  562 m in 18 holes in 2018 and 9  641 m in 117 wells in 2019.  \nIn 2020, granite, acidic igneous and sedimentary rocks around the Thrace Basin (Edirne, \nKırklareli and Tekirda ğ provinces), Çanakkale, Nevş ehir, Yozgat, Giresun, Manisa and Ayd ın \nprovinces were explored for radioactive raw materials. Drilling was conducted at sites licensed \nby the MTA inside the Thrace Basin, Nev şehir, Çanakkale, Giresun and Ayd ın provinces.  \nEti Maden and the MTA  signed a contract on 22  August  2017 for drilli ng exploration in Eti \nMaden’s licensed areas to confirm resource development and to verify the previous exploration. \nUnder this contract, 12  884 m of drilling was carried out in 149 drill holes as of 25  June  2021 in \nNATIONAL REPORTS: TÜRKIYE  \nURANIUM 202 2: RESOURCES, PRODUCTION AND DEMAND, NEA No. 7634, ©  OECD 20 23 475 the Manisa -Köprüba şı area. In addition, 28 holes (5  446 m) and 10 holes (2  904 m) were drilled in \n2020 and 2021 in the Aydın -Söke and Aydın -Nazilli areas, respectively. Also, seven holes (800  m) \nwere drilled in 2021 in the U şak-Eşme area. Drilling is planned to continue in the Manisa -\nKöprüba şı, Aydın-Söke and Aydın -Nazilli areas in 2022. The Aydın -Koçarlı area was evaluated \nas unpromising and abandoned through an application to the General Directorate of Mining and \nPetroleum Affairs.  \nUranium resources  \nIdentified conventional resources (reasonabl y assured and inferred resources)  \nIn 2015 and 2016, an additional 698 tU 3O8 (592 tU) of in situ resources were added to the original \nestimate of the Manisa -Köprüba şı area by the MTA. In 2019, an additional 7 734 t U 3O8 (6 559 tU) \nof resources were identifi ed at the Avanos -Gül şehir deposit. These resources occur within \nTertiary sediments and limestones.  \nAs of 1  January 2021, identified in situ conventional uranium resources in Türkiye amounted to \n16 736 tU (19 736 tonnes U 3O8) including 4 340 tU of reasonab ly assured resources, and 12 396 tU \nof inferred resources. Resources are distributed in the following deposits:  \n• Manisa -Köprüba şı: 3 011 tU in ten orebodies and at grades of 0.04 -0.05%  U3O8 \n(0.034- 0.042%  U) in fluvial Neogene sediments;  \n• Uşak-Eşme: 416 tU at  0.044%  U3O8 (0.037%  U) in Neogene lacustrine sediments;  \n• Aydın -Koçarlı: 176  tU at 0.05%  U3O8 (0.042%  U) in Neogene sediments;  \n• Aydın-Söke -Nazilli: 1 466 tU at 0.08%  U3O8 (0.068%  U) in gneiss fracture zones;  \n• Avanos -Gülşehir: 6 559 tU at 0.05% U 3O8 (0.042%  U) in Eocene sediments.  \nThe Yozgat/Sorgun (formerly known as Temrezli) in situ leaching (ISL) potentially amenable \nEocene basal sandstone channel type uranium deposit is one of Türkiye’s largest and highest -\ngrade uranium deposits, with a mineral resource est imate of 13 282 Mlb U 3O8 (5 108 tU) at an \naverage grade of 0.116% U 3O8 (0.01%  U) and at an average depth of 120  m.

Mine production activities for 25  ha and above, together with the mine \nenrichment activities, are evaluated within the scope of the Annex -I list of the EIA by- law. \nRegulatory regime \nThe Nuclear Regulatory Authority (NDK), as the regulatory authority of Türkiye, undertakes \nregulatory activities concerning facilities, including nuclear power plants, devices, substances, \nand activities related to nuclear energy and ionising radiation. The NDK was established by a decree having the fo rce of Law No. 702 dated 2 July 2018 as an independent authority associated \nwith the Ministry of Energy and Natural Resources (MENR).  \nIn Türkiye, nuclear installations are licensed by the NDK regarding nuclear safety, security \nand radiological protection issues. Before the NDK, the Turkish Atomic Energy Authority (TAEK) \nwas the licensing authority according to Law No. 2690, which regulated the duties and \nresponsibilities of TAEK as a regulatory body.  \nThe NDK was founded in July 2018, with the Decree of Law No. 702, and became the regulatory \nauthority of Türkiye. Within the same month, Presidential Decree No. 4 dated 15  July 2018, came \ninto force. The duties and responsibilities of the NDK were determined and TAEK was reorganised as a research and development  and technical support service organisation. In 2020, the Turkish \nEnergy, Nuclear and Mineral Research Authority (TENMAK) was founded as an affiliate to the \nMinistry of Energy and Natural Resources with Presidential Decrees No. 4 and 57 by incorporating \nthree governmental institutions related to nuclear, boron and rare earth elements research \n(named as TAEK, BOREN and NATEN respectively). The Nuclear Energy Research Institute (NUKEN) \nwas established within TENMAK to carry out studies on nuclear science and technologies. Nuclear \nfuel cycle research and fuel development studies are conducted on a laboratory scale within the \nIstanbul campus of NUKEN.  \nAs a part of the transition process, the NDK will issue new regulations according to the new \nlicensing system. F or the time being, the authorisation process of nuclear installations will \ncontinue as follows:  \n• The existing authorisation applications will be concluded following the provisions of the \nlegislation in force (decrees, regulations, etc.) until the new regula tions are issued \naccording to Decree Law No. 702. In this context, the implementation of the Decree on \nLicensing of Nuclear Installations, which is the main legislation used for licensing, will \ncontinue. The references to TAEK in the applicable legislation  are deemed to have been \nmade to the NDK.  \n• The licensing procedure for nuclear fuel cycle facilities is laid out in the Decree on \nLicensing of Nuclear Installations. According to this decree, nuclear fuel cycle facilities are:  \n– mining, milling, and refining facilities;  \n– conversion facilities;  \n– enrichment facilities;  \n– nuclear fuel element fabrication facilities;  \n– reprocessing facilities for used fuel elements;  \n– radioactive waste management facilities for processing radioactive waste (including final storage).  \nThe licensing procedure for nuclear fuel cycle facilities is initiated by an application from the \nowner. The licensing process comprises three main stages in succession: site licence, construction \nlicence and operating licence. There are several permits requir ed during the licensing process, \nsuch as a limited work permit, a permit to start test operations, a pre -operational test permit, a \nNATIONAL REPORTS: TÜRKIYE  \nURANIUM 202 2: RESOURCES, PRODUCTION AND DEMAND, NEA No. 7634, ©  OECD 20 23 477 full capacity work permit, permission to restart operations and permission to modify the \ninstallation. For each authorisation, the documents required for review and assessment by the \nNDK are defined in the decree.  \nUranium requirements  \nThere are no nuclear power plants in operation or decommissioning activities underway. However, \nthree reactor units are under construction in Tür kiye. Türkiye has considered building a nuclear \npower plant since the 1970s. Rising energy demand, import dependence, and industrial activity are the driving forces behind Türkiye’s move towards developing a civil nuclear power generation \nprogramme. Türkiy e’s recent efforts in this area can be characterised as a first -of-a-kind approach \nin the nuclear sector and have been referred to as an intergovernmental agreement (IGA) model, with long -term contracts of power purchase agreements. In this approach, a pro ject company \nundertakes to design, build, operate and maintain a power plant, whereas the Turkish \ngovernment is responsible for providing the site, various financial and non -financial guarantees, \nconstruction support, and licensing. The project company is also responsible for managing wastes \nand decommissioning the facility.  \nThe construction and operation of a nuclear power plant, through a co -operation agreement \nbetween the government of Russia and the government of Türkiye, is being carried out at Akkuyu,  \nMersin Province, Türkiye.  The Akkuyu Nuclear Power Plant project plans for the construction of \nfour VVER -1200 reactors with a total capacity of 4 800 MWe.  \nUnder the construction schedule, the following dates are planned for the commissioning of \nthe Akkuy u Nuclear Power Plant power units into operation:  \n• Unit No l – 2023;  \n• Unit No 2 – 2024;  \n• Unit No 3 – 2025;  \n• Unit No 4 – 2026.  \nTürkiye also signed a memorandum of understanding with Japan on 3  May 2013 to build \nfour ATMEA1 units at the Black Sea Sinop site. The  technical and economic feasibility studies \nfor the Sinop Nuclear Power Plant were completed in July 2018 and submitted to the MENR for \nevaluation. After a detailed evaluation of the Feasibility Report, Türkiye decided not to continue \nthe Sinop Nuclear Pow er Plant project with Japan.  \nSupply and procurement strategy  \nAccording to A rticle 12 of the agreement between the government of Russia and the government \nof Türkiye on co -operation in the construction and operation of the Akkuyu Nuclear Power Plant, \nnucle ar fuel will be sourced from suppliers based on long -term agreements entered into \nbetween the project company and the suppliers. The Akkuyu Nuclear Joint -Stock Company is \nplanning to secure a supply of nuclear fuel from TVEL, a subsidiary of Rosatom.  \nUrani um policies, uranium stocks and uranium prices  \nNational policies relating to uranium  \nThe law on the “Operation of Boron Salts, Trona and Asphaltite Mines and Nuclear Energy Raw \nMaterials” No. 2840, dated 10 June 1983, states that exploration and mine opera tions are to be \ncarried out by the state.  \nUranium stocks  \nTENMAK -NUKEN holds natural uranium stocks in different forms for research activities.  \nNATIONAL REPORTS: TÜRKIYE  \n478 URA NIUM 202 2: RESOURCES, PRODUCTION AND DEMAND, NEA No. 7634, © OECD 202 3 Uranium exploration and development expenditures and drilling effort  – domestic  \n(TRY [Turkish lira] – excluding VAT)  \n 2019  2020  \nGovernment exploration expenditures  82 193 522  49 919 630  \nTotal expenditures  82 193 522  49 919 630  \nGovernment exploration drilling (m)  198 613  193 329  \nGovernment exploration holes drilled  484 576 \nTotal drilling (m)  198 613  193 329  \nTotal number of holes drilled  484 576 \nReasonably assured resources by production and processing method  \n(in situ tonnes  U) \nProduction method  <USD 80/kgU  <USD 130/kgU  <USD 260/kgU  \nISL 0 4 340  4 340  \nTotal  0 4 340  4 340  \nReasonably assured resources by deposit  type \n(in situ tonnes  U) \nDeposit type  <USD 80/kgU  <USD 130/kgU  <USD 260/kgU  \nSandstone  0 4 340  4 340  \nTotal  0 4 340  4 340  \nInferred resources by production and processing method  \n(in situ tonnes  U) \nProduction method  <USD 80/kgU  <USD 130/kgU  <USD 260/kgU  \nConventional OP  0 10 162  10 162  \nISL 0 768 768 \nUnspecified  0 0 1 466  \nTotal  0 10 930  12 396  \nInferred resources by deposit type  \n(in situ tonnes  U) \nProduction method  <USD 80/kgU  <USD 130/kgU  <USD 260/kgU  \nSandstone  0 4 371  4 371  \nMetamorphite  0 0 1 466  \nCarbonate  0 6 559  6 559  \nTotal  0 10 930  12 396  \n \nNATIONAL REPORTS: TÜRKIYE  \nURANIUM 202 2: RESOURCES, PRODUCTION AND DEMAND, NEA No. 7634, ©  OECD 20 23 479 Installed nuclear generating capacity to 2035  \n(MWe net)  \n2019 2020 2025 2030 2035 \nLow  High  Low  High  Low  High  Low  High  Low  High  \n0 0 0 0 1 200  2 400  4 800  4 800  4 800  4 800  \nAnnual reactor -related uranium requi rements to 2035 (excluding MOX)  \n(tonnes U)  \n2019 2020 2025 2030 2035 \nLow  High  Low  High  Low  High  Low  High  Low  High  \n0 0 0 0 190 380 720 720 720 720 \nTotal uranium stocks  \n(tonnes natural U -equivalent)  \nHolder  Natural uranium  \nstocks in concentrates  Enriched \nuranium stocks  Enrichment \ntails  LWR reprocessed \nuranium stocks  Total  \nGovernment  4.1 0 0 0 4.1 \nTotal  4.1 0 0 0 4.1 \n \nNATIONAL REPORTS: UKRAINE  \n480 URA NIUM 202 2: RESOURCES, PRODUCTION AND DEMAND, NEA No. 7634, © OECD 202 3 Ukraine  \nUranium exploration and mine development  \nHistorical review  \nProspecting for uranium in Ukraine began in 1944 with the analysis of g eological exploration \ndata and mining activity results in the Northern Kryvyy Rig ore basin. The Pervomayske and \nZhovtorechenske uranium deposits were discovered in the 1950s. These deposits were mined \nout in 1967 and 1989, respectively. During the same period, the first sandstone -type deposits \nwere discovered.  \nIn the mid -1960s, the main geological exploration was concentrated in the Kirovograd ore \narea for the discovery of metasomatite -type uranium deposits. Deposits such as Michurinske, \nVatutinske, Severi nske, Central and Novokostyantynivske were discovered in this area.  \nMetasomatite -type deposits make up the main part of uranium resources of Ukraine. The \naverage ore grade in these deposits is 0.1 -0.2% U. The second uranium resource source is \nsandstone -type deposits, with an average ore grade between 0.02 and 0.06% U. They are suitable \nfor mining by in situ leaching (ISL).  \nOngoing uranium exploration and mine development activities  \nDuring 2019 -2021, State Enterprise “ Kirovgeology ” undertook analytical work on existing \ngeological data to identify areas perspective for uranium exploration. Since 2019, all exploration \non sandstone -type uranium deposits has been carried out by a private company. In 2018, a \nUkrainian private company obtained licences for explorat ion of the Safonivske, Surske, \nNovogurivske and Mikhaylivske uranium deposits and carried out exploration activities on them. Ukrainian companies do not carry out any exploration for uranium in other countries.  \nUranium resources  \nIdentified conventional res ources (reasonably assured and inferred resources)  \nAs of 1 January 2021, identified uranium resources (reasonably assured and inferred resources) \nrecoverable at costs <USD 260/kgU were 185 389 tU. Uranium resources recoverable at costs \n<USD 80/kgU were  71 841 tU. Mining and processing losses are considered in these scenarios.  \nThe main uranium resources of economic interest are found in two types of deposits : \n• Metasomatite -type, monometallic deposits located within the Kirovograd block of the \nUkrainian Shiel d. The uranium ore grade is 0.1- 0.2% U. All deposits are suitable for \nunderground mining.  \n• Sandstone -type deposits located within the Dnie per-Bug metallogenic area (17.3 thousand \nkm2). The uranium ore grade is 0.02- 0.06% U. In addition to uranium, molybdenu m, \nselenium and rare earth elements of the lanthanide group occur in these ores. These \ndeposits are suitable for mining by ISL.  \nNATIONAL REPORTS: UKRAINE  \nURANIUM 202 2: RESOURCES, PRODUCTION AND DEMAND, NEA No. 7634, ©  OECD 20 23 481 Undiscovered resources (prognosticated and speculative resources)  \nUndiscovered in situ uranium resources amount to 277 500 tU, i ncluding:  \n• Prognosticated resources of 22 500 tU situated on the flanks of identified deposits.  \n• Speculative resources of 255 000 tU, based on the data from the uranium prognostic map \n(scale of 1:500 000), which was created by SE “ Kirovgeology ”.

Processing of mined ore \nbegins with crushing, followed with extraction by sulphuric acid leaching in autoclaves at the \nhydrometallurgical processing plant. Low -grade uranium ore, combined with expensive \nunderground mining technology, p rocessing technology and transportation (mines are located \nsome 100 km and 130  km from the processing plant), combine to create high production costs, \ncompared to current market prices. To decrease production costs, innovative technologies, such \nas undergr ound radiometric sorting, in -place leaching, heap leaching and reprocessing of \nmaterials in dumps of operating mines are being introduced.  \nA multistage radiometric separator, designed by VostGOK for different sized piles, allows \nsorting of both mined ore a nd material in mine dumps. After the radiometric sorting, the uranium \ncontent in the ore may reach 0.03 -0.3% U.  The uranium content in tailings after radiometric \nsorting is 0.006% U or less.  \nAfter crushing, uranium ore undergoes heap leaching (HL) at the V atutinske deposit, with a \nrecovery factor of about 82 -83%. The uranium production cost of HL is 15% lower than at the \nhydrometallurgical processing plant.  \nAlthough most metasomatite -type ore deposits are suitable for HL, additional ore treatment \nfor effect ive HL is necessary, since the degree of crushing and permeability are the most \nimportant parameters that determine uranium recovery. The maximum size of uranium \nmineral particles is usually from 1 to 5 mm. With an optimum size of ore material of 10  mm,  \n80-90% uranium recovery can be achieved after 2 -3 months of leaching.  \nHeaps contain ore grades of 0.050 -0.080% U as a result of radiometric sorting. The volume \nof the heap is 40  000 t of ore. At the Vatutinske deposit, four heaps with a total volume of 160  Kt \nof ore have been built. At the Michurinske deposit, HL is planned.  \n  \nNATIONAL REPORTS: UKRAINE  \nURANIUM 202 2: RESOURCES, PRODUCTION AND DEMAND, NEA No. 7634, ©  OECD 20 23 483 Uranium production centres technical details  \n(as of 1 January 2021)  \n Centre #1  Centre #2  Centre #3  Centre #4  Centre #5  \nName of production centre  Ingulska mine  Smolinska mine  Novokost yantynivska \nmine  Safonivska \nmine  Severinska mine  \nProduction centre classification  Existing  Existing  Existing  Planned  Planned  \nDate of first production (year)  1968  1973  2011  2023  N/A  \nSource of ore:       \nDeposit name(s)  Michyrinske, \nTsentralne  Vatutinske  Novokostyantynivske  Safonivske  Severinskie \nPodgaytsevske  \nDeposit type(s)  Metasomatic  Metasomatic  Metasomatic  Sandstone  Metasomatic  \nRecoverable resources (tU)  51 810  1 577  79 830  2 248  45 060  \nGrade (% U)  0.1 0.11  0.14  0.02  0.1 \nMining operation:       \nType (OP/UG/ISL)  UG UG UG ISL UG \nSize (tonnes ore/day)  2 000  2 000  6 000  N/A  4 200  \nAverage mining recovery (%)  95 96 96 75 96 \nProcessing plant:       \nAcid/alkaline  Acid  Acid  Acid  Acid  Acid  \nType (IX/SX)  IX IX IX IX IX \nSize (tonnes ore/day)  \nFor ISL (mega or kilolitre/day or \nlitre/hour)  N/A  N/A  N/A  20 000 \nkilolitre/day  N/A  \nAverage process recovery (%)  93 94 94 95 92 \nNominal production capacity \n(tU/year)  450 500 1 500  150 1 200  \nPlans for expansion (yes/no)  Yes No No No No \nOwnership of uranium industry  \nAlmost all enterprises in the Ukrainian uranium industry (geology, mining, processing) are \nowned by t he state.

Permanent monitoring is \nconducted  to control the environmental impacts.  \nIn the hydrometal lurgical plant (Zhovti Vody), process water is recycled for the technological \nprocess. There are two tailings impoundments, one situated 9  km from the hydrometallurgical \nplant consisting of two sections (614.9  ha containing 45.346 Mt of waste) with total a ctivity of \n455.68∙1012 Bq, and the second 0.5  km from the plant (55  ha containing 16  Mt of waste) with total \nactivity of 93.3∙1012 Bq. The latter is no longer used, and reclamation is ongoing.  \nThere are also issues connected with the decommissioning of ura nium mining and uranium \nprocessing enterprises.  \nAt the closed Prydniprovskyy Chemical Plant, there are nine tailings impoundments \n(covering a total area of 268  ha containing 42 Mt of waste) with total activity of 2  775∙1012 Bq and \nsome buildings and other facilities are contaminated by radioactive elements. The Cabinet of \nMinisters of Ukraine has had a state programme for reclamation with state funds amounting to USD 4.5 million since 2005.  \nThe total cost of improving radiological protection across all ente rprises in the nuclear \nindustry and all contaminated areas resulting from mining and processing of uranium is expected \nto amount to USD 360 million, including decontamination of polluted soils, environmental \nmonitoring, installation of monitoring systems w here necessary and improved technology for the \nmanagement of water flows, radioactive rocks in dumps, polluted equipment and land areas. \nUranium requirements  \nUranium production in Ukraine meets 30% of domestic nucle ar energy requirements. As of \n1 January 2 021, nuclear fuel requirements have always been provided by importing fuel from \nRussia (provided by TVEL). Annual fuel loadings of the 4 operating nuclear power plants (comprised of 13 VVER -1000 units and 2 VVER -440 units) are 15 sets of fuel elements at a  total \ncost of about USD  500 million. The “Energy Strategy of Ukraine to 2035”, which was approved by \nthe government in 2017, set a target that uranium requirements for the Ukrainian nuclear reactors be met by domestic production.\n \nInstalled nuclear generat ing capacity by 2035  \nAt present, 15 reactors are operating at 4 nuclear power plants: 6 VVER -1000 units at Zaporizhzhia , \n3 VVER -1000 units at South -Ukrainian, 2 VVER -1000 and 2 VV ER-400 units at Rovenskyy and \n2 VVER -1000 units at Khmelnitskyy.  \nImplementati on of the national programme for nuclear energy development to 2030 will \ninvolve increasing installed capacity of nuclear energy up to 29.5 MWe. To meet this target, annual nuclear energy production will have to increase to 75.2  GWe/h. This will require a life \nextension for operating nuclear power plants, the construction of 12 additional units (with total capacity of 15 000 MWe) and during this time frame, the decommissioning of 12 nuclear power plants that will reach the end of their operational lifetime.  In 2021 this programme was under \ngovernment review.\n \nNATIONAL REPORTS: UKRAINE  \nURANIUM 202 2: RESOURCES, PRODUCTION AND DEMAND, NEA No. 7634, ©  OECD 20 23 485 Uranium policy, uranium stock and uranium price  \nIn 2017, the Ukrainian government approved the “Energy Strategy of Ukraine to 2035”. Ukraine \nviews nuclear generation as economic and carbon -free energy an d plans to increase the nuclear \nenergy portion in the total balance up to 2035. This serves as a background for uranium policy.  \nThe Ukrainian government’s uranium policy includes the following goals:  \n• improve the uranium resource base through the exploratio n of new uranium deposits;  \n• increase uranium production by mining existing uranium deposits;  \n• extend the range of components that Ukraine manufactures for nuclear fuel assemblies;  \n• create a stock of uranium concentrate (U 3O8); \n• diversify nuclear fuel supply.  \nOn 17 April 2009, the Cabinet of Ministers of Ukraine founded the State Concern “ Nuclear Fuel ”, \nthrough the merger of all state enterprises and research and design institutes in the field of \nnuclear fuel. The task of the Concern is to co- ordinate the company’s activity for the construction \nof a nuclear fuel plant.  \nThe “Private Joint Stock Company Nuclear Fuel Fabrication Plant ” for nuclear reactors of the \nVVER -1000 type was established in Ukraine in October 2011. The plant is situated in the \nKirovograd regi on, close to the “ Vatutinske ” uranium deposits. In the JSC, a 50.000006% share \nbelongs to State Concern “ Nuclear Fuel ” and a 49.999994% share to the state Russian company \nTVEL, as of 2021.  \nThe technical economic assessment for construction of the plant was approved by the Cabinet \nof Ministers of Ukraine (statement N437 dated 27 June 2012). The total cost of construction is \nestimated at about USD  80 million, according to a new estimate made by the Ministry. Planned \ncapacity of the plant is 800 nuclear fuel s ets per year. However, the construction of the plant has \nbeen postponed.  \nUranium exploration and development expenditures and drilling efforts – domestic  \n(UAH million as of 1 January 2021)  \n 2019 2020 2021 \n(expected)  \nIndustry* exploration expenditures  0 0 0 \nGovernment exploration expenditures  5.8 1.9 8.0 \nIndustry* development expenditures  39.3  24.4  70.0  \nGovernment development expenditures  13.4  21.1  16.4  \nTotal expenditures  58.5  47.4  94.4  \nIndustry* exploration drilling (m)  0 0 N/A  \nIndustry* exploration holes drilled 0 0 N/A  \nGovernment exploration drilling (m)  601 0 1 485 \nGovernment exploration holes drilled  2 0 18 \nIndustry* development drilling (m)  0 0 0 \nIndustry* development holes drilled  0 0 0 \nGovernment development drilling (m)  10 524 12 740 9 710 \nGovernment development holes drilled  624 688 561 \nSubtotal exploration drilling (m)  601 0 1 485 \nSubtotal exploration holes drilled  2 0 18 \nSubtotal development drilling (m)  10 524 12 740 9 710 \nSubtotal development holes drilled  624 688 561 \nTotal dril ling (m)  11 125 12 740 11 195 \nTotal number of holes drilled  626 688 579 \n* Non -government . \nNATIONAL REPORTS: UKRAINE  \n486 URA NIUM 202 2: RESOURCES, PRODUCTION AND DEMAND, NEA No. 7634, © OECD 202 3 A decision was taken to build a central storage facility for used fuel from domestic VVER \nreactors in the Chernobyl exclusion zone (Law of Ukraine N4384, dated 2 September 2012). \nInitially, the commissioning was planned for 2016.

202 3 Unite d States  \nUranium exploration and mine development  \nHistorical review  \nFrom 1947 through 1970, the US government fostered a domestic private sector uranium \nexploration and production industry to procure uranium for military uses and to promote research and de velopment in peaceful atomic energy applications. By late 1957, both the number of new \ndeposits that private industry brought into production and production capability had increased \nsufficiently to meet projected requirements. Federal exploration programme s ended at that time.  \nPrivate exploration by the US uranium industry increased throughout the 1970s in response \nto rising prices and the projected high demand for uranium to fuel an increasing number of \nnuclear reactors under construction or planned for construction to power civilian electric generation stations. Total annual surface drilling peaked in 1978.  \nExploration has been primarily for sandstone -type uranium deposits in districts such as the \nGrants Mineral Belt and Uravan Mineral Belt of the Colorado Plateau, the Wyoming basins, and \nthe Texas Gulf Coastal Plain region.  \nRecent and ongoing uranium exploration and mine development activities  \nIn 2019 and 2020, the uranium industry in the United States continued to contract uranium requirements from non -domestic sources, leading to historically low levels of domestic \nexploration and production. Decreases in drilling, production and related expenditures are due in \nlarge part to a global oversupply of uranium and the resulting low uranium prices. These \nconti nued low prices have significantly affected the domestic mining industry. Private companies \nthat explore for and produce uranium in the United States have been reducing expenditures to minimal levels to retain property holdings and infrastructure in hopes of a potential price increase.  \nMine owners are also looking to extract mining co- products, such as vanadium and copper, \nto improve the economics of their mines. The only operating conventional uranium mill, the \nWhite Mesa Mill in Utah, has added additiona l capabilities, such as extracting rare earth \nelements from black sands and processing alternative feed material, to remain viable. In \naddition to reducing production -related activities, environmental requirements and costs are \nincreasing as the United Sta tes works to remediate legacy mining impacts. Federal regulators \nand land use agencies usually lead these remediation efforts, which are funded by significant financial contributions by previous mining companies through legal judgements.  \nFrom a recent pea k of USD 352.9 million in 2012, US uranium expenditures decreased by \n75% to USD  87 million in 2020. In 2020, expenditures on US uranium production, including \nfacility expenses, were USD  40 million, down 82% from a recent peak of USD 221.2 million in \n2008. Industry activity has declined to levels that require significant amounts of data to be \nwithheld to avoid disclosure of individual company data.  \nThe trend of decreasing drilling that began in 2013 continued through the latest data made \npublicly available in 2017. The US Energy Information Administration (EIA) could not disclose drilling activity from 2018 through 2020.  \n  \nNATIONAL REPORTS: UNITED STATES  \nURANIUM 202 2: RESOURCES, PRODUCTION AND DEMAND, NEA No. 7634, ©  OECD 20 23 491 United States uranium expenditures, 2008 -2020  \n(USD million)  \nYear  Drilling  Production  Land and other  Total \nexpenditures  Total land  \nand other  Land  Exploration  Reclamation  \n2008  81.9  221.2  164.4  65.2  50.2  49.1  467.6  \n2009  35.4  141.0  104.0  17.3  24.2  62.4  280.5  \n2010  44.6  133.3  99.5  20.2  34.5  44.7  277.3  \n2011  53.6  168.8  96.8  19.6  43.5  33.7  319.2  \n2012  66.6  186.9  99.4  16.8  33.3  49.3  352.9  \n2013  49.9  168.2  90.6  14.6  21.6  54.4  308.7  \n2014  28.2  137.6  74.0  11.6  10.7  51.7  239.7  \n2015  28.7  118.5  76.2  12.1  4.7 59.4  223.5  \n2016  22.3  98.0  49.6  9.9 2.5 37.2  169.9  \n2017  4.0 78.3  40.3  8.9 3.7 27.7  122.6  \n2018  W 65.9  W W W W 108.8  \n2019  W 38.0  W W W W 81.0 \n2020  W 40.0  W W W W 87.0  \nSource: US Energy Information Administration, Domestic Uranium Production Report , 2020, Table 8.  \nNotes: Expenditures are in nominal USD.

Nine ISR plants were on standby at the \nend of 2020, and nine ISR plants were planne d across four states: New Mexico, South Dakota, \nTexas and Wyoming.  \nThe United States has several conventional and ISR -amenable mines and deposits with \nsome degree of permitting or development. Most of these are indefinitely paused, awaiting more \nfavourable  market conditions. ISR mining and exploration is mostly in Texas and Wyoming, and \nconventional mine -related activity is in the part of the Colorado Plateau that includes Colorado, \nUtah, New Mexico and Arizona. Although not a comprehensive review of the st atus of these \nuranium mines and properties, significant activities or developments during 2019 and 2020 are \ndescribed below. Developments ancillary to the uranium production, such as property transfers, \nincremental permitting, and financial actions, are no t included.  \nColorado  \n• La Sal Complex (conventional underground –  Energy Fuels Inc.): In 2019, 5 200 feet \n(1 600 m) of underground drilling was completed and 30 surface exploration holes were \ndrilled. This drill programme followed rehabilitation of the La Sa l and Pandora declines, \nvent raises, main haulage and working areas, and a test -mining programme that \nprimarily focused on the vanadium resource at this uranium -vanadium mine complex.  \n• Sunday Mine Complex (conventional underground –  Western Uranium and Vana dium \nCorporation): In 2020, Western Uranium rehabilitated some underground workings and began production primarily to beneficiate vanadium that occurs with uranium in this deposit. The company encountered regulatory issues that delayed ore shipment, and mining remains on standby status.  \nNew Mexico  \n• Mt. Taylor mine (conventional underground –  Rio Grande Resources): A plan to close the \nmine was submitted to New Mexico in 2019. Commercial production began at Mt. Taylor \nin 1989 from a mineralised zone about 900 metres below the surface that contains one \nof the largest known uranium resources in the United States (~38 000 metric tonnes of \nuranium [tU] historical resource). However, the mine has been on standby status since \n1999, and the public has pressured the st ate to discontinue ongoing extensions of this \nstatus.   \nSouth Dakota  \n• Dewey Burdock (ISR –  Azarga Uranium): Azarga completed federal permitting and \nreleased an updated Preliminary Economic Assessment and mineral resource estimate \nof about 6 500 tU in the mea sured and indicated categories.   \nTexas  \n• Burke Hollow (ISR –  Uranium Energy Corporation): In 2019, UEC received the last of four \nmajor permits required to mine the deposit, and it embarked on a 57 -hole drill \nprogramme to explore and delineate the deposit as well as construct monitoring wells it \nwill use during mining.  \nWyoming  \n• Lance Project (ISR\n – Peninsula Energy Ltd): Peninsula Energy Ltd received approval for a \nlow pH (acid) mining field demonstration in previously mined wellfields in 2019. Acid mining ha s not been approved for any commercial -scale ISR mine in the United States \nbecause of concerns about groundwater restoration.  \n• Reno Creek (ISR – Uranium Energy Corporation [UEC]): In 2019, UEC reported an updated \nNI 43-101 resource estimate of about 10 000 tU in the measured and indicated categories.   \nNATIONAL REPORTS: UNITED STATES  \nURANIUM 202 2: RESOURCES, PRODUCTION AND DEMAND, NEA No. 7634, ©  OECD 20 23 493 Uranium resources  \nIdentified conventional resources (reasonably assured and inferred resources)  \nAt the end of 2020, estimated uranium reserves (in situ reasonably assured resources [RAR]) \nwere 12 000 tU at a ma ximum forward cost of less than USD 80 per kilogram of uranium (kgU). \nAt a cost of less than USD  130/kgU, estimated reserves were 79 231 tU. At a cost of less than \nUSD  260/kgU, estimated reserves were 149 538 tU. Private companies prepare these estimates \nof uranium resources. These estimates change each year due to production (resource depletion), \nchanges in resource estimation, site boundary expansions and evolving production costs. Industry participants prepare the uranium resource estimates and report th em to the US Energy \nInformation Administration (EIA), which aliases the resources by tabulating them into states or regions without further analysis.  \nReserve estimates were available for 68 properties at the end of 2020. Current estimates of \nuranium reserv es cannot be compared with the much larger historical data set of uranium \nreserves published in the July 2010 US Department of Energy (DOE) report, U.S. Uranium Reserves Estimates. The EIA made those estimates based on data it had collected and data develo ped by \nthe National Uranium Resource Evaluation (NURE) programme, operated out of Grand Junction, \nColorado, by the DOE and predecessor organisations. The EIA data covered approximately 200 \nuranium properties with reserve estimates collected from 1984 throu gh 2002. The NURE data \ncovered approximately 800 uranium properties with reserve estimates collected from 1974 \nthrough 1983. Although the 2014 data collected on the Form EIA -851A survey, Domestic \nUranium Production Report (Annual), cover a much smaller set  of properties than the earlier \nEIA and NURE data, the EIA believes that, within its scope, the EIA -851A survey data provide \nmore reliable estimates of the uranium recoverable at the specified forward cost than estimates \nderived from 1974 through 2002. In particular, the NURE data have not been comprehensively \nupdated in many years and are no longer considered a current data source.  \nThe United States has not historically reported inferred resources. In 2014, the United States \nbegan an evaluation of the relative importance of the inferred resource category available in \npublished estimates of US uranium properties. Based on this limited analysis, uranium resources for the United States would likely increase minimally, by 10%, if inferred resources \nwere tabulat ed in addition to reasonably assured resources. Recognising the limited information \navailable and the importance of this class of resource, the United States is considering which \nmechanisms for collecting inferred uranium resource data would be the most vi able.  \nUndiscovered conventional resources (prognosticated and speculative resources)  \nPrognosticated and speculative uranium resources for the United States were last \ncomprehensively assessed in 1980. The US Geological Survey (USGS) is now re -estimating \nundiscovered resources for the United States using the USGS three- part method of quantitative \nundiscovered mineral resource assessment. Estimates for various regions and deposit types have been prioritised and are ongoing. Two assessments have been completed,  estimating \nmean undiscovered resources of about 85 000 tU recoverable in the Texas Coastal Plain and \n15 400 tU in  situ in the Southern High Plains region.\n* The different estimates for in situ versus \nrecoverable uranium is a result of the different grade a nd tonnage models used for the estimates \n(one where in situ uranium data were available; the other where only recovered uranium data \nwere available). The USGS methodology used to estimate undiscovered resources produces \nprobabilistic estimates of potential resources, but these estimates are not in cost categories. \nTherefore, these estimates are not included in undiscovered resource compilations elsewhere in this report.  \n                                                      \n*  For details of the undiscovered resource assessments for th e United States see: Hall, S., et al.

Another deposit model is in development for the Colorado Plateau region. These models \nare used to help identify additional concealed deposits in additi on to informing undiscovered \nresource assessments. Although only about 10% of the undiscovered uranium resources in the \nUnited States have been assessed, future assessments are not scheduled due to staffing \nshortfall s at the US Geological Survey.  \nUS undisc overed uranium resource assessments, 2015 -2020  \nTract \nname  Age  Sub -tract  Permissive \narea (km2) Nknown  Nund Probability of at least the indicated \namount of undiscovered tU  Mean \nundiscovered \nresources (tU)  \n0.9 0.5 0.1 \nSouthern \nHigh Plains  \n(TX, NM, \nOK) Pliocene to \nPleistocene  North  43 920  0 1.1 0 1 600  10 200  3 500  \nSouth  46 630  2 3.9 3 100  10 200  22 900  11 900  \nTotals – Southern High Plains (in situ tU)  90 550  2 5.0  15 400  \nTexas \nCoastal \nPlain – \nClaiborne -\nJackson  Eocene  Rio Grande \nEmbayme nt 38 460  18 27 5 000  18 500  38 100  20 400  \nHouston \nEmbayment  62 670  1 3 100 1 800  5 400  2 500  \nTexas \nCoastal \nPlain – \nCatahoula-\nOakville TX  Oligocene \nto Miocene  Rio Grande \nEmbayment  14 220  35 41 11 200  30 400  50 000  31 500  \nHouston \nEmbayment  16 710  0 3 100 1 900  5 400  2 500  \nTexas \nCoastal \nPlain – \nGoliad -\nWillis -Lissie, \nTX Pliocene to \nPleistocene  Rio Grande \nEmbayment  45 200  10 33 7 700  20 400  50 000  25 400  \nHouston \nEmbayment  52 250  0 4 100 2 000  6 200  2 700  \nTotals – Texas Coastal Plain  \n(recoverable tU ) 229 510  64 111  85 000  \nNotes: The permissive tract area in square kilometres (km2) includes the favourable and prospective areas.

To \nensure the supply of uranium ore would be sufficient to meet future needs, the AEC, in April 1948, \nNATIONAL REPORTS: UNITED STATES  \nURANIUM 202 2: RESOURCES, PRODUCTION AND DEMAND, NEA No. 7634, ©  OECD 20 23 495 announced a domestic ore procurement programme designed to stimulate prospecting and build \na domestic uranium mining industry. The AEC also negotiated concentrate procurement contracts, \nunder the AEA, as amended in 1954, with guaranteed prices for source materials delivered within \nspecified times. Contracts were structured to allow milling  companies that built and operated \nmills the opportunity to amortise plant costs during the procurement -contract period. By 1961, \n27 mills were operating. Overall, 32  conventional mills and several pilot plants, concentrators, \nupgraders, heap leach, and so lution -mining facilities were operating at various times. The AEC, as \nthe sole government purchasing agent, provided the only US  market for uranium. Although many \nof the mills closed soon after completing deliveries scheduled under AEC purchase contracts, several mills continued to produce concentrate for the commercial market after fulfilling their AEC commitments . \nThe AEA, as amended, legalised the private ownership of nuclear reactors for commercial \nelectricity generation. By late 1957, domestic ore reserves and milling capacity were sufficient to \nmeet government needs. In 1958, the AEC’s procurement programmes were reduced in scope and, \nin order to foster atomic energy use for peaceful purposes, domestic producers of ore and \nconcentrate were allowed to s ell uranium to private domestic and foreign buyers. The first \nUS commercial -market contract was finalised in 1966. The AEC announced in 1962 a stretch out \nof its procurement programme that committed the government to take only set annual quantities \nof uranium from 1967 through 1970. This programme change also helped sustain a viable domestic \nuranium industry. The US  government’s natural uranium procurement programme ended in 1970, \nand the industry became a private sector, commercial enterprise with no gover nment purchases. \nThe government, however, continues to monitor private industry exploration and development activities to the extent of meeting federal information and data needs.  \nExploration by the US  uranium industry increased through the 1970s in response to rising \nprices and the projected large demand for uranium to fuel an increasing number of commercial \nnuclear power plants that were under construction or planned. US  production peaked in 1980 \n(16 809 tU) and generally declined until 2003. Beginning in  2004, production began increasing \nagain in response to rising uranium prices. Production began decreasing in 2013 in response to \nan oversupply of uranium on the world market and the resulting lower uranium prices. The \noversupply resulted from the reactor shutdowns in Germany and Japan following the accident \nat the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant. Since 1991, production from ISR mining has accounted for the largest share of US  annual uranium production.  \nStatus of production facilities, production capability, recent and ongoing activities and \nother issues  \nUS uranium mines produced 67  tU in 2019, 76% less than in 2018. Data for 2020 production was \nwithheld. Production in 2019 came from seven facilities: six ISR plants in Nebraska and \nWyoming (Crow Butte Operation, Lost Creek Project, Ross CPP, North Butte, Nichols Ranch and Smith Ranch- Highland Operation) and one underground mine. When mined, uranium ore from \nunderground mines is stockpiled and eventually shipped to the White Mesa Mill for milling into \nU\n3O8 concentrate (yellowcake).  \nAt the end of 2020, one uranium mill (White Mesa in Utah) was operating with a capacity of \n1 814 metric tonnes of ore per day. During 2019, the White Mesa Mill did not produce any \nuranium. In 2020, White Mesa produced about 70 tU from reprocessed on -site pond water and \nalternative feed material. Vanadium was also recovered from pond returns. Alternative feed material includes uranium extracted during municipal water treatment, process residues from \nuranium conversion, uranium- bearing tails from other metal recovery operations, and others. \nTwo mills (Shootaring Canyon in Utah and Sweetwater in Wyoming), with a combined capacity \nof 3 402 metric tonnes of ore per day, were on standby status. Both the Sweetwater and \nShootaring Canyon  mills have been on standby status since the early 1980s and will require \nrehabilitation to operate again.

Employment  levels in the uranium industry in 2009 showed the first significant \ndecrease over the preceding five years, but from 2009 through 2012, total uranium employment \nmade marginal gains. Since 2012, however, uranium employment has declined with the \ndecrease in  production. In 2020, total employment in the US  uranium production industry was \n225 person -years (including reclamation employment), a decrease of 15% from the 2019 total of \n270 person -years and the lowest on record. The EIA had to withhold individual emp loyment \ncategory data in 2020 to protect the anonymity of participants in national -level surveys. In 2020, \nemployment in the uranium production industry spanned at least five states: Colorado, \nNebraska, New Mexico, Texas and Wyoming.  \nFuture production cent res \nSeveral future production centres are currently in either the permitting or licensing process or under development. Significant activities affecting these production centres are described in the previous sections on conventional and ISR mine development.  \nSecondary sources of uranium  \nProduction and/or use of mixed oxide fuels  \nMOX fuel production and use are zero.  \nProduction and/or use of re -enriched tails  \nThe DOE and the Bonneville Power Administration initiated a pilot project to re -enrich a portion \nof the DOE’s tails inventory. This project produced approximately 1  940 metric tonnes of low -\nenriched uranium between 2005 and 2006 for use by Energy Northwest’s 1 190-megawatt electric \n(MWe) Columbia Generating Station between 2007 and 2015.  In mid -2012, En ergy Northwest and \nthe United States Enrichment Corp. (USEC), with the DOE, developed a new plan to re -enrich a \nportion of the DOE’s high- assay tails. The 2013 project produced approximately 3  738 metric \ntonnes of natural uranium, which will be used throug h 2029 to fuel Energy Northwest and \nTennessee Valley Authority ( TVA) reactors.  \nIn 2016, the DOE agreed to sell depleted uranium to GE -Hitachi Global Laser Enrichment, LLC \n(GLE) over a 40 -year period, for enrichment at a proposed GLE facility. GLE will fina nce, construct, \nown and operate the Paducah Laser Enrichment Facility (PLEF) adjacent to the DOE site. Silex \nSystems Ltd, an Australian -owned company developing the laser enrichment technology, has \nlicensed GLE to supply the depleted uranium.  \nIn February 2019, Silex Systems Ltd and Cameco Corp. agreed to restructure ownership of \nGLE with a joint purchase of GE -Hitachi Nuclear Energy’s (GEH) share of GLE. Silex holds the \nmajority at 51%, and Cameco increased its share to 49%.  \nProduction and/or use of reproc essed uranium  \nReprocessed  uranium use and production are zero.  \nNATIONAL REPORTS: UNITED STATES  \n498 URA NIUM 202 2: RESOURCES, PRODUCTION AND DEMAND, NEA No. 7634, © OECD 202 3 Environmental activities and socio -cultural issues  \nRemediation activities  \nNavajo Nation  \nIn 2019, a multiagency group developed a 10- year plan to remediate legacy environmental impacts \nof uraniu m mining that took place on the Navajo Nation between 1944 and 1986. The 2020- 2029 \nplan continues the efforts of two previous 5 -year plans developed by the US federal government. \nThe 10- year plan developed goals to assess and remediate contaminated structu res, assess \npotential mining impacts on water, develop additional sources of safe drinking water, implement \nfinal clean- up and closure of the Tuba City dumpsite, enhance communication and community \ninvolvement, develop and support a Navajo workforce and su pport screening of a uranium -\nexposed community.  \nPiketon  \nDecommissioning and environmental remediation continues at the Portsmouth Gaseous \nDiffusion Plant in Piketon, Ohio, which closed in 2001. In 2015, the DOE created a comprehensive \nplan to demolish the  process buildings and support structures at the Portsmouth Gaseous \nDiffusion Plant. The DOE contractor Fluor -BWXT is demolishing three large buildings. Clean -up \nactivities will likely be completed in 2024.  \nDefense- Related Uranium Mines (DRUM) Program  \nFederal land management agencies, state abandoned mine land programmes, and tribal \ngovernments created the DOE Office of Legacy Management’s Defense -Related Uranium Mines \n(DRUM) Programme to locate and evaluate hazards of the mines that supplied uranium to the  \nUS Atomic Energy Commission for defence -related activities. Field crews are validating the \nlocations of these mines and scanning them for health hazards to human populations and \nwildlife. The programme is divided into three campaigns:  \n• Campaign 1 (in prog ress) focuses on evaluating the approximately 2 500 mines on public \nland and is scheduled to be completed in 2022.  \n• Campaign 2 is an evaluation of mines on tribal lands and is scheduled for 2023 -30. \n• Campaign 3 focuses on mines on private land and is schedul ed for 2024 -30.  \nInformation on the hazards identified by the DRUM programme is shared with partner \nagencies who can work to safeguard physical hazardous mine features such as open mine \nentries, areas of subsidence or unstable highwalls.  \nLegislation/policy  \nFederal  \nIn 2012, over one million acr es of federal land near the Grand Canyon in Arizona were withdrawn \nfrom mineral entry for 20 years due to concerns about the environm ental impacts of mining in \nthis scenic area of the Colorado Plateau. Studies of poten tial environmental impacts of mining \ncontinue in this area.  \nIn 2018, the US Department of the Interior officially listed uranium as a critical mineral based \non Executive Order 13817 issued by President Trump. The US Geological Survey initiated the Earth \nMapping Resources Initiative (Earth MRI) to identify focus areas for critical minerals and to fund \nmapping and geophysical and geochemical surveys to help identify deposits. In 2020, as part of \nEarth MRI, the US Geological Survey identified over 60 high- priority uranium focus areas that could \ncontain undiscovered uranium resources. State geological surveys evaluated these sites and \napplied for funding to initiate studies of the mineral potential of some of these focus areas. The US government will award fund ing for the proposed studies annually based on a competitive \nevaluation of the focus area’s importance for all critical mineral commodities.  \nNATIONAL REPORTS: UNITED STATES  \nURANIUM 202 2: RESOURCES, PRODUCTION AND DEMAND, NEA No. 7634, ©  OECD 20 23 499 Litigation  \nIn June 2019, the US Supreme Court upheld the Commonwealth of Virginia’s moratorium on \nbanning uranium mining. This decision upheld earlier rulings by lower US courts that the \nCommonwealth of Virginia had the right to regulate uranium mining. Coming from the highest US court, this decision effectively prevents the uranium deposit near Coles Hill, Virginia, from development for the foreseeable future.\n \nRegulatory regime \nRegulation  \nThe US Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC), the US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), \nand individual states regulate uranium recovery, but mining regulations for federal lands ar e \nadministered through the federal agency that controls the land (such as the Bureau of Land \nManagement). Before mining begins, Environmental Impact Statements must be completed, \nadequate bonding must be posted, and additional regulatory requirements speci fied by federal \nand state agencies must be satisfied.  \nAs of December 2020, the NRC was reviewing uranium recovery licence applications for two \nISR facilities (one renewal and one expansion) and the agreement states were reviewing three \nISR applications (t wo expansions and one renewal).  \nUS NRC uranium recovery licence applications  \nFacility  Facility type  Applicant  \nCrownpoint  ISR – Renewal (NRC)  Hydro Resources, Inc.  \nNorth Trend  ISR – Expansion (NRC)  Crow Butte Resources  \nLC East/KM Horizon  ISR – Expansion Lost Creek ISR LLC  \nKendrick  ISR – Expansion Stata Energy, Inc.  \nSmith Ranch- Highland  ISR – Renewal  Power Resources, Inc.  \nUranium requirements  \nAnnual US uranium requirements for 2020 to 2040 are projected to decrease from 17 641 tU in \n2020 to 16 276 tU in  2040 (EIA high -case  estimate). The EIA based this decrease on the possibility \nthat some nuclear power plants may retire early due to financial uncertainties in competitive electricity markets. These estimates include the operations of the new Watts Bar Un it 2 in \nTennessee and the construction of Vogtle Unit 3 and Unit 4, scheduled to come online in 2022.  \nIn late July 2019, Ohio became the fifth US state to enact policies that provide compensation \nor other assistance for nuclear power plants. Connecticut, Illinois, New Jersey and New York have implemented similar support programmes since 2017. These price and market support \nlegislations currently affect 14 of the 96 operating commercial power reactors. Many of the \nplants in these states had announced plans to permanently shut down due to unfavourable market conditions. Other US states with nuclear power reactors operating in merchant markets \nare also examining legislative options for their nuclear power industry.  \nSupply and procurement strategy  \nIn the United  States, market forces drive supply and procurement of uranium, and buying and \nselling are conducted solely in the private sector by firms in the uranium mining and nuclear \npower industries. Companies can petition the US government to conduct an investigat ion under \nSection 232 of the Trade Expansion Act of 1962, as amended, to determine the effect of imports \nNATIONAL REPORTS: UNITED STATES  \n500 URA NIUM 202 2: RESOURCES, PRODUCTION AND DEMAND, NEA No. 7634, © OECD 202 3 on national security. In 2018, two US  domestic mining and milling companies petitioned the \nUS Department of Commerce  to investigate whether uranium imp orts from foreign state -owned \nenterprises posed a threat to national security. In July 2019, President Trump declined to impose \nquotas or other trade measures but did establish a Nuclear Fuel Working Group to examine the current state of domestic nuclear f uel production to reinvigorate the entire nuclear fuel supply \nchain. On 23 April 2020, the DOE released the Administration’s Nuclear Fuel Working Group \nstrategy, which contains recommendations to revitalise and strengthen the front end of the \nnuclear fuel cycle and the domestic nuclear industry. One of the recommendations of the \nNuclear Fuel Working Group was to create a national strategic uranium reserve from \ndomestically produced uranium over a 10 -year period. In December 2020, a US federal budget \nwas ena cted that included the first year of funding for developing this uranium reserve. The \nDOE will administer the 150 million USD/year plan, which will buy uranium directly from \ndomestic mines and support domestic conversion operations.  \nUranium policies, uran ium stocks and uranium prices  \nNational policies relating to uranium  \nCurrently, some of the technologies used in the uranium enrichment process in the United States \ncome from foreign sources. These foreign enrichment technologies do not meet national security \nrequirements for enriched uranium. However, it will take time to develop and thoroughly analyse enrichment technologies to inform an acquisition decision for producing unobligated low -\nenriched uranium (LEU). To that end, the US National Nuclear Security Administration’s (NNSA) \nDomestic Uranium Enrichment strategy includes the NNSA Defense Program’s plan to down-blend approximately 20  metric tonnes of highly enriched uranium (HEU) to LEU for use as fuel in \ntritium production reactors. The uranium will be transferred to the NNSA federal partner, the Tennessee Valley Authority (TVA), only for use as fuel in a reactor producing tritium and not for resale or retransfer. The use of this material complies with long -standing US policy and \ninternational commitment s that require LEU used for defence purposes to be free of peaceful use \nrestrictions (that is, unobligated). TVA is responsible for preserving the unobligated LEU to be used as fuel in tritium production reactors.  \nThe DOE conducts uranium transfers in accordance with its authority under the Atomic \nEnergy Act of 1954 and consistent with other applicable laws. On 21 August 2018, the Secretary of Energy issued a determination covering the transfer of low -enriched uranium in support of \nthe tritium production m ission. The Secretarial Determination establishes the national security \npurpose of these transfers; therefore, the DOE will conduct these uranium transfers under Section 3112(e)(2) of the USEC Privatisation Act of 1996, which provides for transfers of enriched uranium to any person for national security purposes, as determined by the Secretary of Energy.  \nUranium stocks  \nAs of 2020, total commercial inventories (producer and utility stocks) were 47  365 tU, a 6% decrease \nfrom the 50  255 tU of inventories held in 2019. Owners and operators of commercial reactors held \n87% of commercial inventories, or 41 214 tU. This holding was a 5% decrease from the 43  518 tU \nowned by this group at the end of 2019.  \nEnriched uranium inventories held by utilities (including fuel elements in storage) \ndecreased 2% from 2019 to 2020 (from 18 623 tU in 2019 to 18 252 tU in 2020), whereas natural \nuranium inventories held by utilities (including uranium hexafluoride [UF 6] in storage) \ndecreased 8% from 2019 to 2020 (from 24 894 tU in 201 9 to 22 962 tU in 2020).  \nUranium prices  \nOwners and operators of US civilian nuclear power reactors (civilian owners and operators, or COOs) purchased 18 808  tU of deliveries from US suppliers and foreign suppliers during 2020, at \na Voglte Unit 3 weighted -average price of USD 86.50/kgU.  \nNATIONAL REPORTS: UNITED STATES  \nURANIUM 202 2: RESOURCES, PRODUCTION AND DEMAND, NEA No. 7634, ©  OECD 20 23 501 The 2020 total of 18 808 tU increased 1% compared with the 2019 total of 18 577 tU. The 2020 \nweighted -average price of USD  86.50/kgU was 6% less than the 2019 weighted -average price of \nUSD  92.53/kgU and the lowest price sinc e 2007.  \nMost uranium delivered in 2020 was of foreign origin. Canada was the top source at 22.4% of \ntotal deliveries, edging out Kazakhstan, which had 22.1% of total deliveries. Uranium originating \nin Kazakhstan, Russia, and Uzbekistan accounted for 47% of  total uranium purchased by US COOs \nin 2020. Uranium originating in Canada and Australia together accounted for 34%.  \nCOOs purchased three material types of uranium for 2020 deliveries from 35 sellers. Uranium \nconcentrate accounted for 46% of the 18  808 tU delivered in 2020. Enriched UF 6 accounted for 32%, \nand natural UF 6 accounted for 22%. During 2020, 24% of the uranium delivered was purchased \nunder spot contracts at a weighted -average price of USD  74.62/kgU. The remaining 76% was \npurchased under long -term contracts at a weighted -average price of USD  90.32/kgU. Spot \ncontracts are contracts that typically have a one -time uranium delivery for the entire contract, \nand the delivery typically occurs within one year of contract execution (signed date). Long -term  \ncontracts are contracts with one or more uranium deliveries to occur at least a year following the \ncontract execution and, as such, may reflect some agreements in the short and medium terms as \nwell as in the long term.  \nIn 2020, COOs signed 39 new purchase contracts with deliveries in 2020 of 4 596 tU at a \nweighted -average price of USD 65.55/kgU. Four of these contracts were long -term and received \ndeliveries of 1 234  tU at a weighted -average price of USD  40.09/kgU. The other 35 contracts were \nspot contracts  with 3 363 tU delivered at a weighted -average price of USD  74.88/kgU. COOs \nreport minimum and maximum quantities of future deliveries under contract to allow the \noption of either decreasing or increasing quantities. At the end of 2020, the maximum uranium  \ndeliveries for 2021 through 2030 under existing purchase contracts for COOs totalled 74 615 tU. \nAlso at the end of 2020, unfilled uranium market requirements for 2021 through 2030 totalled \n72 308 tU. These contracted deliveries and unfilled market require ments combined represent \nthe maximum anticipated market requirements of 146 923 tU over the next 10 years for COOs.  \nAverage US uranium prices, 2006 -2020  \n(USD per kilogram U- equivalent)  \nYear  Spot contracts  Long -term contracts  \n2020  74.6  90.3  \n2019  72.5  98.1  \n2018  71.52  106.56  \n2017  58.13  108.10  \n2016  76.82  119.59  \n2015  95.45  119.41  \n2014  95.26  129.29  \n2013  113.95  140.39  \n2012  132.69  144.68  \n2011  142.18  145.33  \n2010  114.36  131.11  \n2009  120.76  118.91  \n2008  174.06  108.12  \n2007  229.44  63.57  \n2006  102.64  42.59  \nSource: US Energy Information Administration, Uranium Marketing Annual Report , 2020, Table 7.  \n  \nNATIONAL REPORTS: UNITED STATES  \n502 URA NIUM 202 2: RESOURCES, PRODUCTION AND DEMAND, NEA No. 7634, © OECD 202 3 Uranium exploration and development expenditures and drilling effort –  domestic  \n(in USD million)  \n 2017 2018 2019 2020 \nIndustry* exploration expenditures1 3.7 W W W \nGovernment exploration expenditures  0 0 0 NA \nIndustry* development expenditures2 40.6  W W W \nGovernment development expenditures  0 0 0 NA \nTotal expenditures  44.3  W W W \nIndustry* exploration drilling (m)3 W W W W \nIndustry* exploration holes drilled4 W W W W \nIndustry exploration trenches (metres)  NA NA NA NA \nIndustry exploration trenches (number)  NA NA NA NA \nGovernment exploration drilling (m)  0 0 0 NA \nGovernment exploration holes drilled  0 0 0 NA \nGovernment exploration trenches (m)  NA NA NA NA \nGovernment exploration trenches (no.)

All deposits were discovered by the Krasnokholmskaya exploration company, which \nwas renamed Kyzyltepageologia in 1990. Drilling confirmed the initial discovery and devel opment of the first mine at the Uchkuduk deposit in 1959, followed by development of the \nSabyrsai deposit. Both deposits were initially mined using open -pit and underground mining \nmethods until 1975.  \nIn the early 1960s, development of the in situ leaching (ISL) mining technique for recovery \nof uranium from sandstone deposits led to the re -evaluation of previously ignored deposits \nincluding Lavlakan and Ketmenchi and to an increase in exploration efforts in the sedimentary environments of the Kyzylkum deser t. Three uranium districts with 24  sandstone -type deposits \namenable to ISL mining have been established since the Uchkuduk discovery in 1952.  \nSeveral black shale -type uranium deposits, including Dzhantuar, Rudnoye, Kostcheka, \nVoskhod and Dzitym, were iden tified during the 1960s in the Auminzatau Mountains district. \nMineralisation is in black shale related to strata -structure -type and occurs in stratiform and \nstockwork lodes. Resources of individual deposits are relatively small, and grades range from 0.02 to 0.13% U, averaging 0.05% U.  \nSince 1994, the Navoi Mining and Metallurgy Combinat (NMMC) has funded all uranium \nexploration activities in Uzbekistan. In 1995 -1996, Kyzyltepageologia developed the known \nresources of the Severny (Northern) Kanimekh, Alend y, Kendykijube and Tokhumbet deposits. \nIn addition, assessments of undiscovered resources were completed in the Kyzylkum, Bukhara -\nKhiva and Fergana Provinces.  \nBetween 1997 and 2000, Kyzyltepageologia evaluated the known resources of the Kendiktyube, \nSevern y, Kanimeh, Tokhumbet and Ulus deposits, some of which were handed over to the NMMC \nfor further investigation. Delineation drilling was carried out in 2002 on the Kendytyube and Tokhumbet deposits, then transferred to Mining Division No. 5 for commercial d evelopment.  \nFrom 2003 to 2004, Kyzyltepageologia completed exploration and evaluation works in the \nKendyktyube and Tokhumbet deposits, the south- western  flanks of the Sugraly deposit, and the \nwestern and eastern flanks of the Ketmenchi deposit. Kyzyltepageologiya further explored the \nnorthern and southern areas of Central Kyzylkum with government funding.   \n  \n                                                      \n* Report prepared by the NEA/IAEA, based on previous Red Books, a report submitted by the Navoi Mi ning and \nMetallurgy Complex (NMMC), and public data.  \nNATIONAL REPORTS: UZBEKISTAN  \n508 URA NIUM 202 2: RESOURCES, PRODUCTION AND DEMAND, NEA No. 7634, © OECD 202 3 In August 2009, GoscomGeology (State Geology and Mineral Resources Committee) and the \nChina Guangdong Nuclear Uranium Corp. (CGN -URC) set up a 50% -50% uranium exploration \njoint venture, Uz -China Uran, to focus on the black shale deposits in the Boztau area of the \nCentral Kyzylkum Desert in the Navoi region. Approximately 5  500 tU resources have been \nreported. From 2011 to 2013, CGN- URC was to develop te chnology for the production of uranium \nand vanadium from these black shale deposits. No activities have been reported since that time.  \nIn July 2013, the Japan Oil, Gas and Metals National Corporation (JOGMEC) received a five -\nyear licence for uranium explor ation at two prospective areas in the country’s Navoi region. \nJOGMEC indicated that they would implement geological exploration work in the Juzkuduk and \nTamdiykuduk -Tulyantash prospective ore fields. Historical uranium resources discovered at the \nlicensed sites total about 13 000 tU, according to Uzbek government data.  \nDue to recent low uranium prices, development of Uzbekistan’s black shale deposits was \ndelayed indefinitely.  \nRecent and ongoing uranium exploration and mine development activities  \nIn Decembe r 2019, France and Uzbekistan established the French -Uzbek uranium joint venture, \nthe Nurlikum Mining LLC, which is 51% owned by Orano (formerly Areva) and 49% by Uzbekistan’s \nState Committee on Geological and Mineral Resources (GoscomGeology). Nurlikum Mining will \nconduct uranium exploration and mining operations throughout Uzbekistan, focusing on \nsandstone -type uranium mineralisation in the Djengeldi region of Kyzylkum province. Orano will \ncontribute capital and technology to the JV, while the Uzbekistan side will contribute historical \nexploration results. Nurlikum’s first field exploration commenced in 2020 and consisted of 40 drill holes. The planned exploration campaign for 2021 envisioned the drilling of around 300 boreholes.  \nUranium resources  \nUzbekist an’s uranium resources occur primarily in sandstone -type and black shale -type \ndeposits.  \nAll significant sandstone roll -front type uranium resources are found in the Central \nKyzylkum area, comprising a 125  km-wide belt extending over a distance of about 400  km from \nUchkuduk in the northwest, to Nurabad in the southeast. Only sandstone -type deposits have \nbeen exploited.  \nIn 2014, GoscomGeology reported in situ uranium resources in Uzbekistan amounting to \n185 800 tU, with 138  800 tU of sandstone type and 47  000 tU of black shale -type.  \nAs of 1  January 2021, Uzbekistan’s total identified recoverable uranium resources at a cost \n<USD  130/kgU amounted to about 131 290 tU (170  285 tU of in situ resources). Compared with \nthe data as of 1  January 2019, this is a very s light decrease of 1 010 tU in total recoverable \nresources. About 98% of reasonably assured resources (RAR) and 30% of inferred sandstone- type \nresources are controlled by the NMMC, which is owned by the government of Uzbekistan and \nthe balance of which resi des in a “fund of undistributed resources”. The table below gives a \nbreakdown of resources under the control of the NMMC by status and categories.  \nPrognosticated resources are estimated at about 25 000 tU.  \n  \nNATIONAL REPORTS : UZBEKISTAN  \nURANIUM 202 2: RESOURCES, PRODUCTION AND DEMAND, NEA No. 7634, ©  OECD 20 23 509 In situ resources controlled by the NMMC  \n(tonnes  U as of 1 January 2021)  \nStatus  Deposit  Resources category* \nС1 + В С2 C1+C 2 \nNorthern Mining Unit  \nSandstone type for ISL mining  Uchkuduk  148 0 148 \nKendyk -Tyube  405 0 405 \nMejlisaj  3 572  28 3 600  \nSubtotal ISL under development  4 125  28 4 153  \nProsp ective in black shales  Kushkuduk open pit  0 2 839  2 839  \nKushkuduk open -pit waste piles  0 79 79 \nMa’’danli (Rudnoe)  2 412  484 2 896  \nSubtotal prospective in black shales   2 412  3 402  5 814  \nTotal Northern Mining Unit  6 537  3 430  9 967  \nMining Unit No 5   \nSandstone type for ISL mining  Shimolij Bukinoj  3 586  1 208  4 793  \nIstiklol 2 748  109 2 857  \nKukhnur  2 086  0 2 086  \nAulbek  3 067  0 3 067  \nZhanubij Bukinoj  149 0 149 \nNorth Kanimekh 5 521  1 233  6 754  \nBeshkak  0 688 688 \nLojliken  2 2 584  2 586  \nAksa j-1 5 0 5 \nTerekuduk  607 146 753 \nDzhengeldy  1 316  0 1 316  \nSugrali  2 149  3 346  5 495  \nZhanubij Sugrali  1 945  0 1 945  \nKetmonchi  1 179  101 1 280  \nMaibulak  455 0 455 \nTotal Mining Unit No 5    24 815  9 414  34 229  \nSouthern Mining Unit   \nSandstone type  for ISL mining  Shark  472 0 472 \nUlus  192 0 192 \nNurbulok  536 0 536 \nIngichki  657 33 690 \nTotal Southern Mining Unit    1 857  33 1 890  \nNMMC total    33 209  12 877  46 086  \nIncluding sandstone type for ISL development   30 797  9 476  40 272  \nIncluding black  shales type for OP mining  2 412  3 402  5 814  \n* Resource categories according to the national Uzbekistan classification system.

The two largest deposits, Alatanga and Chauli, contained 4  500 tU each. Underground mining was undertaken  from the late 1940s to the early \n1960s. Cumulative production is estimated in the order of several thousand tU. The ore was processed in the Leninabad uranium production centre in Tajikistan.  \nThe mining operator for the sandstone -type Uchkuduk and Sabyrs ai deposits was Mining \nComplex No. 2, which was established in September 1958. In 1967, it was renamed the Navoi \nMining and Metallurgy Combinat (NMMC). The NMMC is part of the Uzbekistan state holding \ncompany Kyzylkumredmetzoloto, which undertakes all uran ium mining in the country.  \nIn the late 1950s, the NMMC commenced operation focusing on uranium and gold production \nin the desert region of Central Kyzylkum province. Early uranium mining was by underground (to 1990) and open pit (to 1994).  \nThe first ISL tests occurred at the Uchkuduk deposit in 1963, followed by ISL tests at the \nSabyrsai, South Bukinai and Ketmenchi deposits in 1968. Commercial ISL mining in Uzbekistan \nbegan in 1975. In 1980, ISL accounted for 29% of total uranium production and by 1985 I SL \ncomprised 56% of total production. Since 1995, the NMMC has been producing uranium using only \nISL technology. Annual production peaked in the 1980s, when 3  700 to 3 800 tU were recovered.  \nIn 2008, the NMMC started mining the major new Northern Kanimekh deposit, northwest \nof Navoi. Northern Kanimekh ore occurs 260 -600 m below the surface, with 77% of the uranium \nresources present at 400 -500 m depth. The NMMC has also started building a pilot plant for ISL \nat the Alendy and Yarkuduk deposits, and began op erating the Aulbek ISL mine in Central \nKyzylkum, as well as developing the Meilysai deposit. The Aulbek mine at the deposit of the \nsame name commenced production in 2013.  \nThe NMMC has developed and implemented two new technologies of acid ISL for ores with  \nhigh carbonate content. The first is a bicarbonate -acid method that is used for ores with a \ncarbonate content above 2%. It is based on bicarbonate ion generation during the soft acidification \nstage, which oxidises and dissolves uranium minerals. This meth od reduces the kinetics of the \nleaching process, but chemical plugging may occur at the final leaching stage. The repair and \nrestoration procedures for wells is reduced by 2.5 -3 times using this method.  \nThe second method uses a mini -reagent technology that  is applied for ores with a carbonate \ncontent >0.5% located in an artesian aquifer. At the first stage, a preliminary ore oxidation \noccurs by pumping compressed air into the aquifer. At the second stage, slightly acidic solutions, formed during aquifer sat uration with atmospheric oxygen, dissolve the contained uranium.  \nThe implementation of these two technologies has significantly reduced acid consumption \nand in turn operating costs by 20 -30%. Another important advantage has been the low impact \nof ISL minin g on the total mineralisation and chemical composition of productive aquifers \nduring and after the leaching process.  \nStatus of production capability and recent and ongoing activities  \nThe NMMC is among the top 10 global gold and uranium mining companies and  is the biggest \nmining company in Uzbekistan.  \nThe NMMC produces uranium by ISL at three mining divisions that operate nine uranium \ndeposits at depths between 120 to 500 metres:  \n• the Northern Mining Unit in Uchkuduk operates the Kendyktube deposit;  \n• the So uthern Mining Unit in Nurabad operates the Sabyrsai deposit;  \nNATIONAL REPORTS : UZBEKISTAN  \nURANIUM 202 2: RESOURCES, PRODUCTION AND DEMAND, NEA No. 7634, ©  OECD 20 23 511 • Mining Unit No. 5 in Zafarabad is the largest division of the three operators of the \nNorthern Bukinai, Lyavlyakan, Beshkak, Ketmenchi, Sugraly, Tokhumbet and Kanimekh deposits.  \nAll mining units  produce “yellow cake” uranium concentrates on -site and send it by rail to \nthe Hydrometallurgical Plant No. 1, located in Navoi, for further processing and purification. The \nNMMC exports all produced uranium. Annual production amounted to approximately 3  300 tU \nto 3 500 tU from 2015 to 2020.  \nThe NMMC promotes monitoring of working conditions and environmental protection. Local \nand central divisions of the national health monitoring authority, the National Committee for \nNature Protection and the National Mi ning Monitoring Authority conduct radiation monitoring of \nall NMMC activities. Monitoring data from peripheral observation wells shows that for productive \naquifers at all ISL sites, the natural geochemical background of the formation water is unchanged \nat a distance of 200 -300 m from the ore body boundary, regardless of the leaching technology used \n(sulphuric acid, bicarbonate -acid or mini- reagent). Radiation monitoring at work locations, \nsupervised areas and the environment shows that the average annual ef fective equivalent \nradiation dose does not exceed permitted levels. For example, for a critical group of the population, \nradiation does not exceed one millisievert per year, which corresponds to the basic limit adopted \nby the International Commission on Radiological Protection (ICRP).  \nOwnership structure of the uranium industry  \nAll uranium produced by the NMMC is owned by the government of Uzbekistan.  \nIn 2019, Uzbekistan began a major reorganisation of the NMMC, separating the uranium \nmining division from gold enterprises. In March 2020, a presidential decree outlined official plans to create State Enterprise Navoiuran, which will focus on uranium and rare earth metals, \nwhile the NMMC will focus on gold and state company Fund NMMC will manage non -core asset s. \nIt is expected that the uranium business transformation to Navoiuran will be completed in 2023.  \nEmployment in the uranium industry  \nFive towns support uranium and gold production activities: Uchkuduk, Zarafshan, Zafarabad, \nNurabad and Navoi, with a combi ned population of about 500  000. These towns remain central \nto the five mining districts. Uranium industry employment in 2020 was about 7  500, though \napproximately 59  000 were employed by the NMMC overall in 2015, with gold mining and other \nactivities included (Navoi Mining and Metallurgy Combinat, 2015).  \nUranium policies, uranium stocks and uranium prices  \nUntil 1992, all uranium  produced in Uzbekistan was shipped to Russia. From 1992 through 2013, \npractically all of Uzbekistan’s uranium production was exported to the United States and other \ncountries through the Nukem company.  In 2008, Korea’s KEPCO signed agreements to purchase \n2 600 tU over six years to 2015, for about USD 400 million. In 2013, 1 663 tU was supplied to China \naccording to the country’s cus tom import statistics.  In May 2014, China’s CGN agreed to buy \nUSD  800 million of uranium through to 2021. Uzbekistan’s state -owned NMMC has also signed \na contract to supply 2  000 tU to India from 2014 through 2018.  \nIn December 2019, Uzbekistan agreed to sell uranium to two Japanese trading companies. \nThe NMMC signed separate contracts with ITOCHU (valued at USD  636.4 million) and Marubeni \n(valued at USD  510.1 million) with both agreements covering uranium deliveries between 2023 \nand 2030.  \n  \nNATIONAL REPORTS: UZBEKISTAN  \n512 URA NIUM 202 2: RESOURCES, PRODUCTION AND DEMAND, NEA No. 7634, © OECD 202 3 Reasonably assu red conventional resources by production method  \n(recoverable tonnes  U) \nProduction method  <USD 40/kgU  <USD 80/kgU  <USD 130/kgU  <USD 260/kgU  Recovery factor (%)  \nIn situ leaching acid  27 240  27 240  47 480  47 480  80 \nOpen pit  0 0 1 690  1 690  70 \nTotal  27 240  27 240  49 170  49 170   \nReasonably assured conventional resources by processing method  \n(recoverable tonnes  U) \nProcessing method  <USD 40/kgU  <USD 80/kgU  <USD 130/kgU  <USD 260/kgU  Recovery factor (%)  \nIn situ leaching acid  27 240  27 240  47 480  47 480  80 \nUnsp ecified  0 0 1 690  1 690  70 \nTotal  27 240  27 240  49 170  49 170   \nReasonably assured conventional resources by deposit type  \n(recoverable tonnes  U) \nDeposit type  <USD 40/kgU  <USD 80/kgU  <USD 130/kgU  <USD 260/kgU  Recovery factor (%)  \nSandstone  27 240  27 240  47 480 47 480  80 \nBlack shales  0 0 1 690  1 690  70 \nTotal  27 240  27 240  49 170  49 170   \nInferred conventional resources by production method  \n(recoverable tonnes  U)  \nProduction method  <USD 40/kgU  <USD 80/kgU  <USD 130/kgU  <USD 260/kgU  Recovery factor (%)  \nIn situ leaching acid  24 900  24 900  49 220  49 220  80 \nOpen pit  0 0 32 900  32 900  70 \nTotal  24 900  24 900  82 120  82 120   \nInferred conventional resources by processing method  \n(recoverable tonnes  U)  \nProcessing method  <USD 40/kgU  <USD 80/kgU  <USD 130/kgU  <USD 260/kgU  Recovery factor (%)  \nIn situ leaching acid  24 900  24 900  49 220  49 220  80 \nUnspecified  0 0 32 900  32 900  70 \nTotal  24 900  24 900  82 120  82 120   \nNATIONAL REPORTS : UZBEKISTAN  \nURANIUM 202 2: RESOURCES, PRODUCTION AND DEMAND, NEA No. 7634, ©  OECD 20 23 513 Inferred conventional resources by deposit type  \n(recoverable tonnes  U) \nDeposit type  <USD 40/kgU  <USD 80/kgU  <USD 130/kgU  <USD 260/kgU  Recovery factor (%)  \nSandstone  24 900  24 900  49 220  49 220  80 \nBlack shales  0 0 32 900  32 900  70 \nTotal  24 900  24 900  82 120  82 120   \nPrognosticated conventional resources  \n(tonnes  U) \nCost ranges  \n<USD  80/kgU <USD  130/kgU <USD  260/kgU  \n24 800  24 800  24 800  \nSpeculative conventional resources  \n(tonnes U)  \nCost ranges  \n<USD  130/kgU <USD  260/kgU Unassigned  \nNA NA NA \nHistorical uranium production by production method  \n(tonnes U in concentrates)  \nProduction method  Total through \nend of 2018  2019 2020 Total through \nend of 2020  2021 \n(expected)  \nOpen -pit mining*  36 249  0 0 36 249  0 \nUnderground mining*  19 719  0 0 19 719  0 \nIn situ leaching  84 498  3 500  3 512  91 510  3 520  \nTotal  140 466  3 500  3 512  147 478  3 520  \n* Pre -2018 totals may include uranium recovered by heap and in -place leaching.  \nOwnership of uranium production in 2020  \nDomestic  Foreign  \nTotals  \nGovernment  Private  Government  Private  \n(tU) (%) (tU) (%) (tU) (%) (tU) (%) (tU) (%) \n3 512  100 0 0 0 0 0 0 3 512  100 \n \n  \nNATIONAL REPORTS: UZBEKISTAN  \n514 URA NIUM 202 2: RESOURCES, PRODUCTION AND DEMAND, NEA No. 7634, © OECD 202 3 Uranium industry emp loyment at existing production centres  \n(Person -years)  \n 2018 2019 2020 2021 (expected)  \nEmployment directly related to uranium production  7 340  7 387  7 500 7 700 \nShort -term production capability  \n(tonnes U/year)  \n2025 2030 \nA-I B-I A-II B-II A-I B-I A-II B-II \n3 000  3 000  3 000  3 000  2 000  2 500  2 000  2 500  \n2035 2040 \nA-I B-I A-II B-II A-I B-I A-II B-II \n500 2 500  800 2 500  0 2 000  0 2 000  \nMid-term production projection   \n(tonnes U/year)   \n2021 2022 2025 2030 2035 2040 \n3 520  3 500  3 000  2 500  2 500  2 000  \n \nNATIONAL REPORTS: VIET NAM  \nURANIUM 202 2: RESOURCES, PRODUCTION AND DEMAND, NEA No. 7634, ©  OECD 20 23 515 Viet Nam  \nUranium exploration and mine development  \nHistorical review  \nUranium mineralisation in Viet Nam is associated with rare earth element deposits (Lao Cai \nprovince), phosphate deposits (Cao Bang province), and sandstone and coal deposits (Quang Nam pro vince). The first exploration programmes were initiated before 1955 by French \ngeologists of the Geological Department of Indochina. Beginning in 1978, a systematic regional \nexploration programme was conducted over the entire country using radiometric methods \ncombined with geological observations. About 25% of the country was also covered by airborne \nradiometric and magnetic surveys at a scale of 1:25  000 and 1:50  000, respectively. This led to \nthe discovery of several promising areas in the provinces of Cao Bang, Lao Cai, Yen Bai and \nQuang Nam. Between 1997 and 2002, the Geological Division for Radioactive and Rare Elements (GDRRE) of the Ministry of Natural Resources and Environment carried out detailed uranium \nexploration and evaluation (including drilling , trenching, and bulk sampling) in the Palau and \nParong areas of the Quang Nam province.  \nRecent and ongoing uranium exploration and mine development activities  \nSince 2010, the GDRRE has been carrying out uranium exploration in the Parong area in the Quang Nam province of central Viet Nam. The project consists of an investigation and evaluation of Triassic sandstone -type uranium deposits.  \nExploration activities on the Parong deposit, covering an area of 1.9  km\n2, consist of geophysical \nand geological surveys,  trenching, drilling, and mining tests. Over the main part of the deposit, \n712 holes (60  954 m) have been drilled on a 25  x 25 m2 grid to depths of between 30  and 150  m. \nExtensions of the deposit have also been drilled on a more widely spaced grid (between  50 x 50 m2 \nand 50  x 25 m2). A mining test was conducted via a 130  m adit from which 3  holes were drilled to \n300 m for hydrogeological tests. Results showed a limited amount of water in the formations.  \nMineralisation at Parong is associated with medium - to coarse -grained sandstone with \norganic matter. Three main levels of mineralisation in reduced formations have been defined, separated by oxidised sandstones. Mineralisation over a lateral extension of 200 -300 m has been \nintersected and varies in thickness from a few centimetres to a few metres.  \nIn support of this exploration project, the Institute for Technology of Radioactive and Rare \nElements (ITRRE) has carried out research on ore leaching treatment methods, laboratory and pilot -scale tests, as well as i nvestigations on the management of mining wastes and tailings. \nThe results show that the heap leach method is suitable for the low -grade Parong ore, with \nuranium recovery of over 75%.  \nCurrent uranium exploration activities are focused on the recovery of thorium and uranium \nfrom rare earth concentrates. Research has been carried out by the ITRRE. A continuous counter -\ncurrent extraction process for the simultaneous recovery of thorium and uranium from the Yen Phu rare earth concentrate leach solutions was developed. Separation of thorium and uranium from xenotime leach solutions was achieved by solvent extraction using primary and tertiary \namines.  The results show that the extraction method is suitable for the recovery of thorium and \nuranium from rare earth co ncentrate with thorium and uranium purities of greater than 99%. \nUranium exploration and research on uranium extraction from uranium ores are continuing.  \nNATIONAL REPORTS: VIET NAM  \n516 URA NIUM 202 2: RESOURCES, PRODUCTION AND DEMAND, NEA No. 7634, © OECD 202 3 Uranium resources  \nIdentified conventional resources  \nIn 2011- 2012, the uranium potential of part “A” of  the Parong area (drilled at a 25  x 25 m2 grid) \nwas assessed. Uranium resources, estimated using a 0.0085%  U cut -off grade, amounted to \n1 200 tU at an average grade of 0.034%  U. These resources are classified as reasonably assured \nresources in the highest cost category (<USD 260/kgU or <USD 100/lb  U3O8). \nFrom 2013 to 2015, the uranium potential of part “G” of the Parong- Palua area was assessed. \nInferred uranium resources are estimated at 1  081 tU. \nFrom 2016 to 2019, estimation continued of the uranium poten tial of remaining parts “B”, \n“C”, “D” and “F” of the Palua -Parong.  \nResults of a previous evaluation of uranium resources as of 31  December  2008 in the main \narea of the Quang Nam province showed that:  \n• the Palua deposit consists of five orebodies with total resources amounting to 4  596 tU, \nincluding 984 tU inferred resources and 3 612 tU prognosticated;  \n• the Parong deposit consists of seven orebodies with total resources amounting to \n3 867 tU, including 1  200 tU inferred resources and 2  667 tU prognosticated;  \n• the Khehoa -Khecao deposit consists of four orebodies with total resources amounting to \n5 803 tU, including 1 125 tU inferred resources and 4 678 tU prognosticated;  \n• the Dong Nam Ben Giang deposit consists of eight orebodies with total resources amounting to  1 556 tU, including 337 tU inferred resources and 1 219 tU prognosticated;  \n• resources of the An Diem deposit amount to 1  853 tU, including 354  tU inferred and \n1 499 tU prognosticated.  \nThe deposits of the Quang Nam province described above amount to a total of 4 000 tU \ninferred resources, 13 675 tU prognosticated resources and 17 675 tU combined inferred and \nprognosticated resources.  \nUndiscovered conventional resources (prognosticated and speculative resources)  \nThe results of geological exploration conducted  by the GDRRE show that there are more than \nten uranium occurrences and deposits located in the northern provinces (Lai Chau, Lao Cai, Yen \nBai, Son La, Ha Giang, Cao Bang, PhuTho, and Thai Nguyen), as well as in the highlands and \ncentral provinces.  \nUranium  deposits in the Lai Chau province are associated with rare earth element deposits. \nIn the Cao Bang province, uranium mineralisation is associated with phosphate deposits, and in the Quang Nam province, uranium is associated with sandstones and in coal dep osits.  \nThe undiscovered conventional uranium resources as of 31  December 2008 amounted to a \ntotal of 81  200 tU prognosticated and 321 600 tU speculative resources. Some of the prognosticated \nresources include: 3  612 tU at Palua; 2  667 tU at Parong; 4  678 tU at Khehoa- Khecao; 1  219 tU at \nDong Nam Ben Giang; and 1  499 tU at An Diem .  \nUnconventional resources and other materials  \nUranium exploration activities associated with rare earth element ores (Dong Pao bastnaesites, Namxe bastnaesite, YenPhu xenotime and  beach sand monazite, etc.) are being conducted.  \nUranium production  \nNo uranium has been produced in Viet Nam.  \nNATIONAL REPORTS: VIET NAM  \nURANIUM 202 2: RESOURCES, PRODUCTION AND DEMAND, NEA No. 7634, ©  OECD 20 23 517 Future production centres  \nThe objective of the current uranium exploration programme is to increase the resource base to \na total of 5  500 tU3O8 (4 665 tU) inferred and 8  000 tU3O8 (6 780 tU) prognosticated, as well as to \ndetermine the feasibility of mining these deposits. The ITRRE has researched ore processing and \nhas started to survey the environmental conditions of future mining operations. No pr oduction \ncentre is planned at this time.  \nEnvironmental activities and socio -cultural issues  \nEnvironmental activities, such as monitoring the environmental impacts resulting from exploration, are being carried out.  \nUranium requirements  \nViet Nam had a plan t o develop several nuclear power plants with up to 14  nuclear reactors with \na total net nuclear electricity generating capacity of about 15  000 MWe to 16  000 MWe by the \nyear 2030. Seven potential build sites had been selected with each site having the poten tial to \naccommodate four to six units.  \nIn March 2010, the Prime Minister of Viet Nam approved the plan for the implementation of \nthe NinhThuan Nuclear Power Project, which included the PhuocDinh and Vinh Hai Nuclear Power Plants.  \nUnder this plan,  the first  nuclear power plant would have consisted of two VVER -type \npressurised water reactors (PWRs) with a total net nuclear electricity generating capacity of about 2  000 MWe, built in co- operation with Rosatom.

The expected annual reactor -related uranium requirements \nwould have been satisfied by imports and domestic production.  \nBecause of a lack of funding at the end of 2016, the Viet Nam government decided to \nabandon plans to buil d the NinhThuan Nuclear Power Plant.  \nReasonably assured conventional resources by production method  \n(in situ tonnes  U) \nProduction method  <USD 40/kgU  <USD 80/kgU  <USD 130/kgU  <USD 260/kgU  \nUnderground mining (UG)  0 0 0 1 200  \nTotal  0 0 0 1 200  \nReasonably assured conventional resources by processing method  \n(in situ tonnes  U) \nProcessing method  <USD 40/kgU  <USD 80/kgU  <USD 130/kgU  <USD 260/kgU  \nHeap leaching*  0 0 0 1 200  \nTotal  0 0 0 1 200  \n* From open -pit and underground mining.  \nNATIONAL REPORTS: VIET NAM  \n518 URA NIUM 202 2: RESOURCES, PRODUCTION AND DEMAND, NEA No. 7634, © OECD 202 3 Reasonably assured conventional resources by deposit type  \n(in situ tonnes  U) \nDeposit type  <USD 40/kgU  <USD 80/kgU  <USD 130/kgU  <USD 260/kgU  \nSandstone  0 0 0 1 200  \nTotal  0 0 0 1 200  \nInferred conventional resources by production method  \n(in situ tonnes  U) \nProduction method  <USD 40/kgU  <USD 80/kgU  <USD 130/kgU  <USD 260/kgU  \nUnspecified  0 0 0 4 000  \nTotal  0 0 0 4 000  \nInferred conventional resources by processing method  \n(in situ tonnes  U) \nProcessing method  <USD 40/kgU  <USD 80/kgU  <USD 130/kgU  <USD 260/kgU  \nUnspecified  0 0 0 4 000  \nTotal 0 0 0 4 000  \nInferred conventional resources by deposit type  \n(in situ tonnes  U) \nDeposit type  <USD 40/kgU  <USD 80/kgU  <USD 130/kgU  <USD 260/kgU  \nSandstone  0 0 0 4 000  \nTotal  0 0 0 4 000  \nPrognosticated conventional resources  \n(in situ tonnes  U) \nCost range s \n<USD  80/kgU <USD  130/kgU <USD  260/kgU \nNA NA 81 200  \nSpeculative conventional resources  \n(in situ tonnes U)  \nCost ranges  \n<USD  130/kgU <USD  260/kgU Unassigned  \nNA NA 321 600  \n \nNATIONAL REPORTS: ZAMBIA  \nURANIUM 202 2: RESOURCES, PRODUCTION AND DEMAND, NEA No. 7634, ©  OECD 20 23 519 Zambia * \nUranium exploration and mine development  \nHistorical review  \nUranium was  first identified in Zambia (then Northern Rhodesia) at the site of the Mindola \ncopper mine in Kitwe, leading to the mining of this small deposit between 1957 and 1959. A total \nof 102  tU3O8 (86 tU) was produced. Although no uranium has been produced from t hat mine or \nany other in Zambia since then, exploration activity has been carried out periodically by the government and by private companies.  \nSporadic uranium exploration activities took place during the 1980 -1990s but attention was \nprimarily focused on copper. It was only in the mid -2000s that interest in uranium was stimulated \nby the dramatic rise in the spot market price for uranium.  \nThe exploration environment in Zambia underwent a fundamental change in 1969. Prior to \nthis date, all mineral rights we re held privately, but in 1969 these rights reverted to the state. That \nsame year, the state also effectively nationalised mining by becoming a majority shareholder in \nall mining companies active in the country (principally copper). Financial realities, in cluding a \ndecline in copper prices, along with recommendations from external bodies, such as the World \nBank and International Monetary Fund, encouraged the state to enter into a process of \nprivatisation. This became a reality in 1997 with the primary objec tive of encouraging foreign \ninvestment in the country.  \nDuring the 1980s, active exploration for uranium by government and private companies \nwithin the Katanga metasediments revealed small, isolated medium -grade deposits in the \nDome areas of North -Western Province. The Karoo sediments were also prospected by private \ncompanies and revealed some small low -grade deposits at shallow depths. Speculative \nresources were estimated at 35 000 tU. \nRecent and ongoing uranium exploration and mine development activities  \nIn mid -2011, Equinox Minerals was taken over by Barrick Gold Corp. for CAD  7.3 billion. At that \ntime, a total of 4.2  Mt of uraniferous ore at a grade of 0.118%  U3O8 (0.1%  U) was stockpiled at the \nLumwana copper mine, which could be processed at a later da te if Barrick decided to build a \nuranium mill for an estimated cost of USD  200 to 230 million. In 2012, drilling programmes at \nLumwana were focused on resource definition at Chimiwungo, reserve delineation at Chimiwungo and Malundwe, extension exploration drilling at Chimiwungo and condemnation drilling to test for economic mineralisation in areas of planned mining infrastructure. A total of \n237 277 m of diamond drilling and 49  029 m of reverse circulation drilling was completed during \n2012 in order to bett er define the limits of mineralisation and develop an updated, more \ncomprehensive block model of the ore body for mine planning purposes. Total resources, \nincluding the uranium ore stockpiled at Malundwe, amounted to 7  492 tU at an average grade \nof 0.07%  U. However, the ore body did not meet economic expectations. The drilling defined \nsignificant additional mineralisation, some at higher grades. However, much of this \nmineralisation was deep and would therefore require a significant amount of waste stripping , \nmaking it uneconomic based on the expected operating costs and current market copper prices. \n                                                      \n*  Report prepared by the NEA/IAEA, based on previous Red Books and company reports.  \nNATIONAL REPORTS: ZAMBIA  \n520 URA NIUM 202 2: RESOURCES, PRODUCTION AND DEMAND, NEA No. 7634, © OECD 202 3 Activity continued on several key initiatives to lower costs, including improvements to \noperating systems and processes.  \nDenison Mines Corp. completed extensive drilling in 2011 and 2012 on their Mutanga Project \nsandstone -hosted deposits. Airborne geophysical techniques were used to locate anomalies and \npotential uranium mineralisation. Near -surface mineralisation at the Dibwe East zones 1 and 2 \nis consistent over  a strike length of 4  km, with a core area of high -grade ore. Future exploration \nactivities are expected to include extensive surficial geochemistry and surface radon surveys, \ngeological mapping, and airborne geophysics, all of which will be used to assist  in defining drill \ntargets.  \nAt the end of 2012, African Energy Resources concluded baseline environmental studies for \nthe Chirundu Uranium Project, which was the only work completed by African Energy on its sandstone uranium projects. The Chirundu Project  near the Zimbabwe border is focused on \nexploring the Njame and Gwabe deposits and reports 4  270 tU as measured, indicated and \ninferred resources. A mining licence was granted for the project in October 2009, with a view to \ndevelop a 500 tU/yr acid heap le ach operation. It includes the Siamboka prospect. A feasibility \nstudy was commenced but then deferred because of low uranium prices. The company was also \nexploring the Chisebuka deposit, 250  km along strike south -west.  \nIn June 2016, GoviEx Uranium Inc. ac quired Denison’s Mutanga Project, and in October 2017 \ncompleted the acquisition of Africa Energy’s Chirundu Uranium Project, consolidating these \nadjacent projects. In 2017, GoviEx released a new preliminary economic assessment for the \nMutanga uranium proje ct, including the mineral resource estimate for Mutanga, Dibwe, Dibwe \nEast, Gwabe, Njame and Njame South sandstone -hosted ore deposits. The project currently \nconsists of five main uranium deposits under three fully permitted contiguous mining licences, \ntotalling 140  km in strike length. It also includes two more prospective licences covering 100  km².  \nDue to the COVID -19 pandemic, GoviEx employees worked remotely in 2020. In 2021, GoviEx \nplanned soil sampling and geological mapping in the Mutanga area. GoviE x has also planned an \n8 000 m down hole  percussion drilling programme (100 m x 50 m grid), focused on the Dibwe \nEast deposit and new areas defined by previous trench sampling east of Dibwe East.   \nIn 2017 and 2018, exploration expenditures by GoviEx amounted  to USD  710 000 and \nUSD  607 000, respectively. In 2019 and 2020, exploration expenditures amounted to USD  502 000 \nand USD  536 000, respectively.  \nUranium resources  \nIdentified conventional resources (reasonably assured and inferred resources)  \nIn October 2017, GoviEx published an NI 43 -101 technical report on a preliminary economic \nassessment of the Mutanga Project. GoviEx’s Mutanga and Chirundu deposits are estimated to hold 21.6  Mt of measured ore resources grading 269 ppm  U (0.0269% U) and containing 5  810 tU. \nInferred resources are estimated to be 74.6 Mt of ore grading 231 ppm  U (0.0231%  U) and \ncontaining 17  270 tU. A mineral reserve has yet to be evaluated for the project.  \nThe Lumwana copper mine, where resources are hosted by mica -quartz -kyanite schists of \nthe Katangan Supergroup, contains identified recoverable resources of 6 967 tU. Potential for the \ndiscovery of additional uranium resources exists in various parts of the country that have been poorly explored. Of particular interest is the Copperbelt, where many copper orebodies are associated with uranium mineralisation.  \nUranium production  \nHistorical review  \nA total of 102  tU3O8 (86 tU) was produced at the Mindola mine in Kitwe during the late 1950s. \nProduction ceased in 1960 and no uranium has been pro duced since.  \nNATIONAL REPORTS: ZAMBIA  \nURANIUM 202 2: RESOURCES, PRODUCTION AND DEMAND, NEA No. 7634, ©  OECD 20 23 521 Uraniferous ore is stockpiled at Lumwana while mining the higher -grade Malundwe copper \ndeposit. As of May, 2019, the stockpile amounted to 4 Mt of ore grading at 910 ppm  U (3 640 tU).  \nFuture projects  \nGoviEx is planning to develop a USD 123 million project at Mutanga and Chirundu with \nestimated cash operating costs of USD  31.1/lb  U3O8 (USD  80.85/kgU), excluding royalties, when \nuranium prices have improved to >USD 55/lb  U3O8 (USD  143/kgU). Following a successful licence \nrenewal, a preliminary ec onomic study of the Mutanga deposit was undertaken for an open- pit \nmine with acid heap leaching. Most of the mineralisation occurs within 125  m of surface and is \nconsidered to have a reasonable prospect for economic mining. The project holds a 25 -year \nmini ng licence, environmental approval, and a radioactive materials licence. The project is \nforecast to produce 920  tU/yr for 11 years.  \nOn 25 June 2020, the Mining Cadastre Department of Zambia issued a letter to GoviEx revoking \nthe Chirundu mining permit due to failure to develop the permitted mining areas and carry out \nmining operations. However, on 10 May 2021, the Chirundu mining permit was reinstalled subject \nto the completion of exploration and development milestones to advance the project towards a \nfeasi bility study.  \nUranium production centre technical details  \n(as of 1 January 2021)  \n Centre #1  Centre #2  \nName of production centre   Lumwana  Mutanga  \nProduction centre classification  Planned  Planned  \nDate of first production (year)   NA NA \nSource of ore:     \nDeposit name(s)  Malundwe -Chimiwungo  Dibwe -Mutanga -Gwabe -Njame  \nDeposit type(s)  Metasomatic  \n(metamorphosed schists)  Sandstone  \nRecoverable resources (tU)  6 967  20 311  \nGrade (% U)  0.07  0.033  \nMining operation:     \nType (OP/UG/ISL)  OP OP \nSize (tonnes  ore/day)  2 800  11 000  \nAverage mining recovery (%)   NA NA \nProcessing plant:     \nAcid/alkaline  Acid  Acid  \nType (IX/SX/HL)  SX HL \nSize (tonnes ore/day)    \nAverage process recovery (%)  93.1  88.0  \nNominal production capacity (tU/year)   650 920 \nPlans fo r expansion (yes/no)     \nOther remarks    \nMine currently operated by Barrick  \n Mine construction on hold \nuntil uranium price increases  \nNATIONAL REPORTS: ZAMBIA  \n522 URA NIUM 202 2: RESOURCES, PRODUCTION AND DEMAND, NEA No. 7634, © OECD 202 3 Environmental activities and socio -cultural issues  \nWaste rock management  \nEquinox Minerals’ original plan in 2003 was to ex cavate, stockpile and return the uraniferous \nore to the Malundwe pit at the Lumwana copper mine, following completion of mining, as it \nwas considered uneconomic at the time to recover the uranium. However, in 2006, with a uranium spot price in excess of US D 50 lb/U\n3O8 (USD  130/kgU), the project was re- evaluated. In \nJanuary 2011, Equinox Minerals reported that the portion of the stockpile containing 0.09%  U \nand 0.8%  Cu could be treated at a later date, if and when a uranium plant is built. The stockpile \nis currently classified and expensed as “waste” in the copper project.  \nIn May 2019, Lumwana Mining Company (LMC) presented an Environmental and \nSocioeconomic Impact Assessment (ESIA) Report for the proposed Stockpile Reclamation Project within the Lumwana Mining Licences. LMC has been mining from the Malundwe open pit since \n2007. Initially, LMC investigated the feasibility of processing the stockpile for both copper and \nuranium. The uranium project was shelved in 2009/2010 following the decline of the uranium \nprice and low availability of uranium ore. The proposed stockpile for reclamation covers an area \nof approximately 148  000 m\n2 and contains about 4 Mt of “ore”. The stockpiles contain about 0.5% \nsulphur, 0.79% copper and 920 ppm uranium (3  640 tU). The Chimu wungo resource contains less \nthan 0.5% of copper and less than 200 ppm of uranium.  \nEnvironmental activities and socio -cultural issues  \nThe Mines and Minerals Development Act (1995) makes provision for the preparation of a project brief when applying for a m ining licence. This must include an environmental impact statement \ndetailing all potential impacts of the project. Annual environmental audits must be carried out \nto ensure compliance and contributions must be made to an environmental management fund \nfor rehabilitation.  \nLocal inhabitants around the Mutanga Project were involved in public hearings organised \nby the Environmental Council of Zambia. Agreements were reached regarding the displacement of 107 families in two villages to allow for the construction of the mine infrastructure.  \nDenison/GoviEx has been providing funding to several communities and sustainability \nprojects including the construction of schools and clinics, water boreholes, and agricultural programmes.  \nAfrican Energy assisted with the const ruction of a community health post and completed a \nwater borehole at Sikoongo Village near their Chirundu Project.  \nBarrick invested in a wide range of sustainable development initiatives in 2012, including \nfunding for infrastructures (such as schools and health centres), literacy and agricultural programmes, community sports and recreation, and an initiative to provide microcredit and \nsmall business loans to women.  \nUranium requirements  \nZambia has no nuclear  generating capacity. In May 2016, Russia’s Rosatom  signed an \nintergovernmental agreement on co -operation in the peaceful uses of nuclear energy, which \nprovides a framework for opportunities to construct nucle ar power facilities. Further \nco-operation agreements were signed with Rosatom in December 2016 and  in June 2017. The \nfirst is for the training of Zambian specialists in Russia so that within 15  years, Russia will assist \nZambia with training young nuclear energy engineers, plan for nuclear power plant personnel, \ndevelop a nuclear energy regulator and bu ild a research reactor. Zambia aims to become a \nregional centre for nuclear medicine. With respect to energy, nuclear power is needed to prevent \nload shedding due to unreliable supply.  \nNATIONAL REPORTS: ZAMBIA  \nURANIUM 202 2: RESOURCES, PRODUCTION AND DEMAND, NEA No. 7634, ©  OECD 20 23 523 Uranium policies, uranium stocks and uranium prices  \nNational policies relating to uranium  \nMining activities, in general, were regulated by the Mines and Minerals Act (1995), but until \nrecently there was no legislation specifically relating to the exploration and mining of uranium. The act was repealed in 2008 following wides pread criticism of what was perceived to be excessive \nscope for granting tax concessions. This act was replaced by the Mines and Minerals Development \nAct 2008, which ruled that no special agreements should be entered into by the government for \nthe developm ent of large- scale mining licences. It also effectively ended development agreements \nconcluded under the previous act. The Mines and Minerals Development (Prospecting, Mining, \nand Milling of Uranium Ores and Other Radioactive Mineral Ores) and Regulations of 2008 deal \nwith the mining, storage and export of uranium. Mining and export licences will only be granted \nwhen the Radiation Protection Authority is satisfied that the operations pose no environmental \nand health hazards. Applicants for export licences w ill also have to prove the authenticity of the \nimporters in terms of International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) guidelines.  \nA study by the Council of Churches concluded that current legislation and enforcement was \ninadequate for uranium mining. It recommended that current regulations be revised to address \nthe concerns of local communities and that education and awareness programmes be initiated \nprior to any uranium exploration and mining activities.  \nIn 2011, Zambia and Finland signed co -operation projects aimed at helping the southern \nAfrican nation review regulations on uranium mining as well as the management of the mineral. \nThe two projects are aimed at evaluating current regulations on uranium and other radioactive \nminerals as well as developing a moder n geographical information infrastructure. These projects \nare designed to help the country evaluate, update and review regulations regarding the safety of \nuranium mining.  \nZambia has upgraded its mining legislation to include uranium, following detailed \nconsultations with the IAEA. It started issuing uranium mining licences late in 2008, and in  2017 \nwas undertaking a further revision of regulations regarding uranium exploration and mining.  \nReasonably assured conventional resources by production method  \n(reco verable tonnes U)  \nProduction method  <USD 40/kgU  <USD 80/kgU  <USD 130/kgU  <USD 260/kgU  Recovery factor (%)  \nOpen -pit mining (OP)  0 0 12 777  12 777  88-93 \nTotal  0 0 12 777  12 777  88-93 \nReasonably assured conventional resources by processing method  \n(reco verable tonnes U)  \nProcessing method  <USD 40/kgU  <USD 80/kgU  <USD 130/kgU  <USD 260/kgU  Recovery factor (%)  \nConventional from OP  0 0 12 777  12 777  88-93 \nTotal  0 0 12 777  12 777  88-93 \n  \nNATIONAL REPORTS: ZAMBIA  \n524 URA NIUM 202 2: RESOURCES, PRODUCTION AND DEMAND, NEA No. 7634, © OECD 202 3 Reasonably assured conventional resources by deposit type  \n(recoverable tonnes U)  \nDeposit type  <USD 40/kgU  <USD 80/kgU  <USD 130/kgU  <USD 260/kgU  \nSandstone  0 0 5 810  5 810  \nMetasomatite  0 0 6 967  6 967  \nTotal  0 0 12 777  12 777  \nInferred conventional resources by production method  \n(recoverable tonnes U)  \nProduction  method  <USD 40/kgU  <USD 80/kgU  <USD 130/kgU  <USD 260/kgU  Recovery factor (%)  \nOpen -pit mining (OP)  0 0 18 221  18 221  88-93  \nTotal  0 0 18 221  18 221  88-93  \nInferred conventional resources by processing method  \n(recoverable tonnes U)  \nProcessing me thod  <USD 40/kgU  <USD 80/kgU  <USD 130/kgU  <USD 260/kgU  Recovery factor (%)  \nConventional from OP  0  0  18 221  18 221  88-93  \nTotal  0  0  18 221  18 221  88-93  \nInferred conventional resources by deposit type  \n(recoverable tonnes U)  \nDeposit type  <USD  40/kgU  <USD 80/kgU  <USD 130/kgU  <USD 260/kgU  \nSandstone  0 0 17 270  17 270  \nMetasomatite  0  951 951 \nTotal  0 0 18 221  18 221  \nHistorical uranium production by production method  \n(tonnes U in concentrates)  \nProduction method  Total through  \nend of 2018  2019 2020 Total through \nend of 2020  2021 \n(expected)  \nUnderground mining1 86  0  0  86  0  \nTotal  86  0  0  86  0  \n1.

Glossary of definitions and terminology  \nUnits  \nMetric units are used in all tabulations and statements. Resources and production quantities \nare expressed in terms of tonnes (t) contained uranium (U) rather than uranium oxide (U 3O8). \n1 short ton  U3O8 = 0.769 tU \n1% U 3O8 = 0.848%  U \n1 USD/lb  U3O8 = USD  2.6/kg U \n1 tonne  = 1 metric ton  \nResource terminology  \nResource estimates are divided into separate catego ries reflecting different levels of confidence \nin the quantities reported. The resources are further separated into categories based on the cost of production.  \nDefinitions of resource categories  \nUranium resources are broadly classified as either convention al or unconventional. \nConventional resources are those that have an established history of production where uranium \nis a primary product, co -product or an important by -product (e.g.,  from the mining of copper \nand gold). Very low -grade resources or those fr om which uranium is only recoverable as a minor \nby-product are considered unconventional resources.  \nConventional resources, as well as unconventional resources when sufficient data are \navailable, are further divided according to different confidence levels  of occurrence into four \ncategories:  \n1. Reasonably assured resources (RAR)  \n2. Inferred resources (IR)  \n3. Prognosticated resources (PR)  \n4. Speculative resources (SR)  \nThe correlation between these resource categories and those used in selected national \nresource classifi cation systems is shown in Figure  A3.1.  \nReasonably assured resources (RAR)  refers to uranium that occurs in known mineral deposits \nof delineated size, grade and configuration such that the quantities, which could be recovered \nwithin the given production co st ranges with currently proven mining and processing technology, \ncan be specified. Estimates of tonnage and grade are based on specific sample data and \nmeasurements of the deposits and on knowledge of deposit characteristics. Reasonably assured \nresources have a high assurance of existence. Unless otherwise noted, RAR are expressed in \nterms of quantities of uranium recoverable from mineable ore (see: recoverable resources).  \nInferred resources (IR)  refers to uranium, in addition to RAR, that is inferred to o ccur based \non direct geological evidence, in extensions of well- explored deposits, or in deposits in which \ngeological continuity has been established but where specific data, including measurements of \nthe deposits, and knowledge of the deposit’s characteri stics, are considered to be inadequate to \nGLOSSARY OF DEFINITIONS AND TERMINOLOGY  \n538 URA NIUM 202 2: RESOURCES, PRODUCTION AND DEMAND, NEA No. 7634, © OECD 202 3 classify the resource as RAR. Estimates of tonnage, grade and cost of further delineation and \nrecovery are based on such sampling as is available and on knowledge of the deposit \ncharacteristics as determined in the  best known parts of the deposit or in similar deposits. Less \nreliance can be placed on the estimates in this category than on those for RAR. Unless otherwise \nnoted, inferred resources are expressed in terms of quantities of uranium recoverable from mineab le ore (see: recoverable resources).  \nFigure A3.1.

Nonetheless, the chart presents a reasonable approximation of \nthe comparability of terms.  \nWork to align the NEA/IAEA and national resource classification systems outlined above \nwith the United Nations Framework Classification system remains under cons ideration. (For a \nsummary of recent efforts, see: www.unece.org/fileadmin/DAM/energy/se/pdfs/egrc/egrc5  \n_apr2014/ECE.ENERGY.GE.3.2014.L1_e.pdf ) \nPrognosticated resources (PR)  refers to uranium, in addition to inferred resources, that is \nexpected to occur in deposits for which the evidence is mainly indirect and which are believed \nto exist in well- defined geological trends or areas of mineralisat ion with known deposits. \nEstimates of tonnage, grade and cost of discovery, delineation and recovery are based primarily \non knowledge of deposit characteristics in known deposits within the respective trends or areas \nand on such sampling, geological, geoph ysical or geochemical evidence as may be available. \nLess reliance can be placed on the estimates in this category than on those for inferred resources. Prognosticated resources are normally expressed in terms of uranium contained in mineable ore (i.e.,  in situ quantities).  \nSpeculative resources (SR) refers to uranium, in addition to prognosticated resources, that is \nthought to exist, mostly on the basis of indirect evidence and geological extrapolations, in deposits \ndiscoverable with existing exploration te chniques. The location of deposits envisaged in this \ncategory could generally be specified only as being somewhere within a given region or geological \ntrend. As the term implies, the existence and size of such resources are speculative. SR are \nnormally exp ressed in terms of uranium contained in mineable ore (i.e.,  in situ quantities).  \nGLOSSARY OF DEFINITIONS AND TERMINOLOGY  \nURANIUM 202 2: RESOURCES, PRODUCTION AND DEMAND, NEA No. 7634, ©  OECD 20 23 539 Cost categories  \nThe cost categories, in United States dollars (USD), used in this report are defined as: <USD  40/kgU \n(<USD 15/lbs U 3O8), <USD  80/kgU (<USD 30/lbs U 3O8), <USD  130/kgU (<USD 50/lbs U 3O8), and \n<USD  260/kgU (<USD 100/lbs U 3O8). The resource tonnages across the cost categories are \ncumulative, from lowest cost to highest cost category. This means that uranium resource tonnage \nfor any cost category also includes uraniu m resource tonnage from the lower cost categories:  \n• Resources categorised at <USD 40/kgU are the lowest cost, most economically attractive \nto recover.  \n• Resources categorised at <USD 80/kgU include those recoverable at <USD 40/kgU, plus \nresources that are mor e expensive to recover, up to USD 80/kgU.  \n• Resources categorised at <USD 130/kgU include those recoverable at <USD 80/kgU and \n<USD 40/kgU, plus resources that are more expensive to recover, up to USD 130/kgU.  \n• Resources categorised at <USD 260/kgU include th ose recoverable at all lower cost \ncategories, plus resources that are more expensive, up to USD 260/kgU.   \nAll resource categories are defined in terms of costs of uranium recovered at the ore processing \nplant.  \nNote: It is not intended that the cost catego ries should follow fluctuations in market conditions.  \nConversion of costs from other currencies into USD is done using an average exchange rate \nfor the month of June in that year except for the projected costs for the year of the report.  \nWhen estimating the cost of production for assigning resources within these cost categories, \naccount has been taken of the following costs:  \n• the direct costs of mining, transporting and processing the uranium ore;  \n• the costs of associated environmental and waste management du ring and after mining;  \n• the costs of maintaining non- operating production units where applicable;  \n• in the case of ongoing projects, those capital costs that remain non -amortised;  \n• the capital cost of providing new production units where applicable, including the cost of financing;  \n• indirect costs such as office overheads, taxes and royalties where applicable;  \n• future exploration and development costs wherever required for further ore delineation to the stage where it is ready to be mined;  \n• sunk costs are not norm ally taken into consideration.  \nRelationship between resource categories  \nFigure A3.2 illustrates the inter -relationship between the different resource categories. The \nhorizontal axis expresses the level of assurance about the actual existence of a given ton nage \nbased on varying degrees of geologic knowledge while the vertical axis expresses the economic feasibility of exploitation by the division into cost categories.  \n  \nGLOSSARY OF DEFINITIONS AND TERMINOLOGY  \n540 URA NIUM 202 2: RESOURCES, PRODUCTION AND DEMAND, NEA No. 7634, © OECD 202 3 Figure A3.2. NEA/IAEA classification scheme for uranium resources  \n \nRecoverable resources  \nRAR and IR estimates are expressed in terms of recoverable tonnes of uranium (i.e.,  quantities of \nuranium recoverable from mineable ore), as opposed to quantities contained in mineable ore, or \nquantities in situ (i.e.,  not taking into account mining and m illing losses). Therefore, both \nexpected mining and ore processing losses have been deducted in most cases.

Current practice is to use a mixture of \ndepleted uranium oxide and plutonium oxide.  \nDepleted uranium : Uranium wher e the 235U assay is below the naturally occurring 0.7110%. \nNatural uranium is a mixture of three isotopes, uranium -238 – accounting for 99.2836%, uranium -\n235 – 0.7110%, and uranium -234 – 0.0054%. Depleted uranium is a by -product of the enrichment \nprocess, where enriched uranium is produced from initial natural uranium feed material.  \nProduction terminology1 \nProduction centres  \nA production centre, as referred to in this report, is a production unit consisting of one or more ore processing plants, one or more associated mines and uranium resources that are tributary \nto these facilities. For the purpose of describing production centres, they have been divided into \nfour classes, as follows:  \n• Existing  production centres are those that currently exist in operatio nal condition. \nProduction projections continue until the identified resources (costs < USD 130/kgU) are exhausted.  \n• Committed  production centres are those that are either under construction or are firmly \ncommitted for construction.  \n• Planned  production centr es are those for which feasibility studies are completed and \nregulatory approvals are at advanced stage.  \n• Prospective  production centres are those for which some level of feasibility study has \nbeen completed and the centres are supported by tributary RAR a nd Inferred resources. \nIndicative start -up dates should have been announced.  \nProduction, production capacity, and production capability  \nProduction : Denotes the amount of uranium output, in tonnes  U contained in concentrate, from \nan ore processing plant or production centre (with milling losses deducted).  \nProduction capacity : Denotes the nominal level of output, based on the design of the plant and \nfacilities over an extended period, under normal commercial operating practices.  \nProduction capability : Refers to an estimate of the level of production that could be practically \nand realistically achieved under favourable circumstances from the plant and facilities at any of the types of production centres described above, given the nature of mined ore flow to the m. \nProjections of production capability are supported only by RAR and/or IR. The projection is presented based on those resources recoverable at costs <USD  130/kgU.  \nMining and milling  \nOpen -pit mining: The extraction of near -surface uranium -bearing rock (or e) from an exposed \npit open to the air, typically excavated as a series of benches or steps cut into the pit walls using \ndrilling, blasting, and heavy machinery.  \n  \n                                                      \n1. IAEA (1984), Manual on the Projection of Uranium Production Capability,  General Guidelines, Technical Report \nSeries  No. 238, IAEA, Vienna.  \nGLOSSARY OF DEFINITIONS AND TERMINOLOGY  \n542 URA NIUM 202 2: RESOURCES, PRODUCTION AND DEMAND, NEA No. 7634, © OECD 202 3 Underground mining: The extraction beneath the surface of uranium- bearing rock (ore) through  \nhorizontal, sub -horizontal, and vertical tunnels (shafts, slopes, adits, declines and other \nopenings that access the ore body) using drilling, blasting, and various types of specialized \nheavy machinery. More commonly applied to high- grade, low -tonnage dep osits where the ore \nbody is too deep to be mined economically by open pit methods.  \nIn situ leaching mining (ISL, sometimes referred to as in situ recovery, or ISR):  The extraction of \nuranium from sandstone using chemical solutions and the recovery of uranium at the surface. ISL extraction is conducted by injecting a suitable uranium -dissolving leach solution (acid or \nalkaline) into the ore zone below the water table thereby oxidising, complexing and mobilising the uranium; then recovering the pregnant solut ions through production wells, and finally \npumping the uranium bearing solution to the surface for further processing.  \nHeap leaching (HL) : Heaps of ore are formed over a collecting system underlain by an impervious \nmembrane. Dilute sulphuric acid solutions are distributed over the top surface of the ore. As the \nsolutions seep down through the heap, they dissolve a significant (50 -75%) amount of the \nuranium in the ore. The uranium is recovered from the heap leach product liquor by ion exchange or solvent ext raction.  \nIn-place leaching (IPL) : involves leaching of broken ore without removing it from an \nunderground mine. This is also sometimes referred to as stope leaching or block leaching.  \nCo-product : Uranium is a co -product when it is one of two commodities th at must be produced \nto make a mine economic. Both commodities influence output, for example, uranium and copper are co -produced at Olympic Dam in Australia. Co- product uranium is produced using \neither the open -pit or underground mining methods.  \nBy-product : Uranium is considered a by -product when it is a secondary or additional product. \nBy-product uranium can be produced in association with a main product or with co -products \n(e.g.,  uranium recovered from the Palabora copper mining operations in South  Africa) . By-\nproduct uranium is produced using either the open -pit or underground mining methods.  \nUranium from phosphate rocks : Uranium has been recovered as a by -product of phosphoric \nacid production. Uranium is separated from phosphoric acid by a solvent extract ion process. \nThe most frequently used reagent is a synergetic mixture of tri -n-octyl phosphine oxide (TOPO) \nand di  2-ethylhexyl phosphoric acid (DEPA).  \nIon exchange (IX ): Reversible exchange of ions contained in a host material for different ions in \nsolution without destruction of the host material or disturbance of electrical neutrality. The \nprocess is accomplished by diffusion and occurs typically in crystals possessing – one or two – \ndimensional channels where ions are weakly bonded. It also occurs in re sins consisting of three -\ndimensional hydrocarbon networks to which are attached many ionisable groups. Ion exchange \nis used for recovering uranium from leaching solutions.  \nSolvent extraction (SX): A method of separation in which a generally aqueous solution is mixed \nwith an immiscible solvent to transfer one or more components into the solvent. This method is used to recover uranium from leaching solutions.  \nIdled mine : A temporarily closed operation. Idled mines are those with associated identified \nuranium resources and processing facilities that have all necessary licenses, permits and \nagreements for operation and have produced commercially in the past, but were not producing \nas of the middle to end of the second year of the current Red Book reporting pe riod. Annual \nproduction capacity of an idled mine could be potentially increased relatively rapidly if the \noperation is brought back into service. Although each mine operation is unique in terms of \noperational costs and a threshold price for reopening, the ab ility to raise capital as required to \nresume operation and to meet regulatory requirements, idled mines could be returned to \nproduction in roughly one year, given that all permits and licences remain in place.  \n  \nGLOSSARY OF DEFINITIONS AND TERMINOLOGY  \nURANIUM 202 2: RESOURCES, PRODUCTION AND DEMAND, NEA No. 7634, ©  OECD 20 23 543 Demand terminology  \nReactor -related requireme nts: Refers to natural uranium acquisitions not  necessarily \nconsumption during a calendar year.  \nEnvironmental terminology2 \nClose -out: In the context of uranium mill tailings impoundment, the operational, regulatory and \nadministrative actions required to place a tailings impoundment into long -term conditions such \nthat little or no future surveillance and maintenance are required.  \nDecommissioning : Actions taken at the end of the operating life of a uranium mill or other \nuranium facility in retiring it from  service with adequate regard for the health and safety of \nworkers and members of the public and protection of the environment.

Sandstone deposits  \n2. Proterozoic unconformity deposits  \n3. Polymetallic Fe -oxide breccia complex deposits  \n4. Paleo -quartz -pebble conglomerate deposits  \n5. Granite -related  \n6. Metamorphite  \n7. Intrusive d eposits  \n8. Volcanic -related deposits  9. Metasomatite deposits  \n10. Surficial deposits  \n11. Carbonate deposits  \n12. Collapse breccia -type deposits  \n13. Phosphate deposits  \n14. Lignite and coal  \n15. Black shale  \nDetailed descriptions with examples follow. Note tha t for Red Book reporting purposes only \nthe major categories are used. However, descriptions of the sub -types for sandstone and \nProterozoic unconformity deposits have also been included because of their importance.  \n1.  Sandstone deposits : Sandstone -hosted u ranium deposits occur in medium - to coarse -\ngrained sandstones deposited in a continental fluvial or marginal marine sedimentary \nenvironment. Uranium is precipitated under reducing conditions caused by a variety of reducing agents within the sandstone, such as carbonaceous material, sulphides (pyrite), \nhydrocarbons and ferro -magnesian minerals (chlorite), bacterial activity, migrated fluids \nfrom underlying hydrocarbon reservoirs, and others. Sandstone uranium deposits can be divided into five main sub -types (with frequent transitional types between them):  \n• Basal channel deposits : Paleodrainage systems consist of wide channels filled with thick, \npermeable alluvial -fluvial sediments. The uranium is predominantly associated with \ndetrital plant debris in orebodies  that display, in a plan view, an elongated lens or ribbon -\nlike configuration and, in a section -view, a lenticular or, more rarely, a roll shape. \nIndividual deposits can range from several hundred to 20  000 t of uranium, at grades \nranging from 0.01% to 3%.  Examples are the deposits of Dalmatovskoye (Transural \nRegion), Malinovskoye (West Siberia), Khiagdinskoye (Vitim District) in the Russia, deposits of the Tono District (Japan), Blizzard (Canada) and Beverley (Australia).  \n• Tabular deposits consist of uraniu m matrix impregnations that form irregularly shaped \nlenticular masses within reduced sediments. The mineralised zones are largely oriented \nparallel to the depositional trend. Individual deposits can contain several hundred tons up \nto 150 000 tons of uraniu m, at average grades ranging from 0.05% to 0.5%, occasionally up \nto 1%. Examples of deposits include Hamr -Stráz (Czech Republic), Akouta, Arlit, and \nImouraren (Niger) and those of the Colorado Plateau (United States).  \n• Roll- front deposits: The mineralised z ones are convex in shape, oriented down the \nhydrologic gradient. They display diffuse boundaries with reduced sandstone on the down -\ngradient side and sharp contacts with oxidised sandstone on the up -gradient side. The \nmineralised zones are elongate and sin uous approximately parallel to the strike, and \nperpendicular to the direction of deposition and groundwater flow. Resources can range from a few hundred tons to several thousands of tons of uranium, at grades averaging \n0.05% to 0.25%. Examples are Budenovs koye, Tortkuduk, Moynkum, Inkai and Mynkuduk \n(Kazakhstan); Crow  Butte and Smith Ranch (United States) and Bukinay, Sugraly and \nUchkuduk (Uzbekistan).  \n• Tectonic/lithologic deposits  are discordant to strata. They occur in permeable fault zones \nand adjacent sandstone beds in reducing environments created by hydrocarbons and/or \ndetrital organic matter. Uranium is precipitated in fracture or fault zones related to \n                                                      \n3. This classification of the geological types of uranium deposits was updated in 2011- 2012 through a \nnumber of IAEA consultancies that included an update of the World Distribution of Uranium Deposits \n(UDEPO).  \nGLOSSARY OF DEFINITIONS AND TERMINOLOGY  \nURANIUM 202 2: RESOURCES, PRODUCTION AND DEMAND, NEA No. 7634, ©  OECD 20 23 545 tectonic extension. Individual deposits contain a few hundred tons up to 5  000 tons of \nuranium at average grades ranging from 0.1 -0.5%. Examples include the deposits of the \nLodève District (France) and the Franceville basin (Gabon).  \n• Mafic dykes/sills  in Proterozoic sandstones: mineralisation is associated with mafic \ndykes and sills that are interlayered with or crosscut Proterozoic sandstone formations. \nDeposits can be subvertical along the dyke’s borders, sometime within the dykes, or \nstratabound within the sandstones along lithological contacts (Westmoreland District, Australia; Matoush, Canada). Deposi ts are small to medium (300 -10 000 t) with grades \nlow to medium (0.05 -0.40%).  \n2.  Proterozoic unconformity deposits : Unconformity -related deposits are associated with and \noccur immediately below and above an unconformable contact that separates Archean to Paleoproterozoic crystalline basement from overlying, redbed clastic sediments of \nProterozoic age. In most cases, the basement rocks immediately below the unconformity \nare strongly hematised and clay altered, possibly as a result of paleoweathering and/or \ndiagenetic/hydrothermal alteration. Deposits consist of pods, veins and semimassive \nreplacements consisting of mainly pitchblende. They are preferentially located in two major \ndistricts, the Athabasca Basin (Canada) and the Pine Creek Orogen (Australia). The unconformity -related deposits include three sub -types:  \n• Unconformity -contact deposits : Except for the low -grade Karku deposit (Russia), these \nall occur in the Athabasca Basin (Canada). Deposits develop at the base of the sedimentary cover directly above the unconformity. They form elongate pods to \nflattened linear orebodies typically characterised by a high -grade core surrounded by a \nlower grade halo. Most of the orebodies have root -like extensions into the basement. \nWhile some mineralisation is open spac e infill, much of it is replacement style. Often, \nmineralisation also extends up into the sandstone cover within breccias and fault zones forming “perched mineralisation”. Deposits can be monometallic (McArthur River) or \npolymetallic (Cigar Lake). Deposits  are medium to large to very large (1 000-200 000 t) and \nare characterised by their high grades (1 -20%).  \n• Basement -hosted deposits  are strata -structure bound in metasediments below the \nunconformity on which the basinal clastic sediments rest. The basement o re typically \noccupies moderately to steeply dipping brittle shear, fracture and breccia zones \nhundreds of metres in strike length that can extend down- dip for several tens to more \nthan 500  m into basement rocks below the unconformity. Disseminated and vein  \nuraninite/pitchblende occupies fractures and breccia matrix but may also replace the \nhost rock. High -grade ore is associated with brecciated graphitic schists. These deposits \nhave small to very large resources (300 -200 000 t), at medium grade (0.10- 0.50%) . \nExamples are Kintyre, Jabiluka and Ranger in Australia, Millennium and Eagle Point in the Athabasca Basin and Kiggavik and Andrew Lake in the Thelon Basin (Canada).  \n• Stratiform structure -controlled deposits : low -grade (0.05 -0.10%), stratabound, thin \n(1-5 m) zones of mineralisation are located along the unconformity between Archean,  \nU-Th-rich granites and Proterozoic metasediments with minor enrichments along \nfractures. This type of deposit (Chitrial and Lambapur) has only been observed in the \nCuddapah bas in (India). Resources of individual deposits range between 1  000-8 000 t. \n3.  Polymetallic iron -oxide breccia complex deposits : This type of deposit has been attributed to \na broad category of worldwide iron oxide -copper -gold deposits. Olympic Dam (Australi a) is \nthe only known representative of this type with significant by -product uranium resources. \nThe deposit contains the world’s largest uranium resources with more than 2  Mt of uranium. \nDeposits of this group occur in hematite -rich granite breccias and co ntain disseminated \nuranium in association with copper, gold, silver and rare earth elements. At Olympic Dam, \nthis breccia is hosted within a Mesoproterozoic highly potassic granite intrusion that exhibits \nregional Fe -K-metasomatism. Significant deposits an d prospects of this type occur in the \nsame region, including Prominent Hill, Wirrda Well, Carrapeteena, Acropolis and Oak Dam \nas well as some younger breccia -hosted deposits in the Mount Painter area.  \n4.  Paleo -quartz pebble conglomerate deposits : Deposits of this type contain detrital uranium \noxide ores, which are found in quartz pebble conglomerates deposited as basal units in \nGLOSSARY OF DEFINITIONS AND TERMINOLOGY  \n546 URA NIUM 202 2: RESOURCES, PRODUCTION AND DEMAND, NEA No. 7634, © OECD 202 3 fluvial to lacustrine braided stream systems older than 2  400-2 300 Ma. The conglomerate \nmatrix is pyritic and contains gold, as w ell as other accessory and oxide and sulphide \ndetrital minerals that are often present in minor amounts. Examples include deposits in the \nWitwatersrand basin, South Africa, where uranium is mined as a by -product of gold as well \nas deposits in the Blind Riv er/Elliot Lake area of Canada.  \n5.  Granite -related deposits  include: i) true veins composed of ore and gangue minerals in \ngranite or adjacent (meta -) sediments and ii) disseminated mineralisation in granite as \nepisyenite bodies. Uranium mineralisation occu rs within, at the contact or peripheral to the \nintrusion. In the Hercynian belt of Europe, these deposits are associated with large, peraluminous two- mica granite complexes (leucogranites). Resources range from small to \nlarge and grades are variable, from low to high.  \n6.  Metamorphite deposits  correspond to disseminations, impregnations, veins and shear \nzones within or affecting metamorphic rocks of various ages. These deposits are highly \nvariable in sizes, resources and grades.  \n7.  Intrusive deposits  are c ontained in intrusive or anatectic igneous rocks of many different \npetrochemical compositions (granite, pegmatite, monzonite, peralkaline syenite and \ncarbonatite). Examples include the Rossing and Rossing South (Husab) deposits (Namibia), \nthe deposits in t he Bancroft area (Canada), the uranium occurrences in the porphyry copper \ndeposits of Bingham Canyon and Twin Butte (United States), the Kvanefjeld and Sorensen deposits (Greenland) and the Palabora carbonatite complex (South Africa).  \n8.  Volcanic -related deposits  are located within and near volcanic calderas filled by mafic to \nfelsic, effusive and intrusive volcanic rocks and intercalated clastic sediments. Uranium \nmineralisation is largely controlled by structures as veins and stockworks with minor \nstrati form lodes. This mineralisation occurs at several stratigraphic levels of the volcanic \nand sedimentary units and may extend into the basement where it is found in fractured \ngranite and metamorphic rocks. Uranium minerals (pitchblende, coffinite, U\n6+ minera ls, \nless commonly brannerite) are associated with Mo- bearing sulphides and pyrite. Other \nanomalous elements include As, Bi, Ag, Li, Pb, Sb, Sn and W. Associated gangue minerals comprise violet fluorite, carbonates, barite and quartz. The most significant d eposits are \nlocated within the Streltsovska caldera in Russia. Other examples are known in China \n(Xiangshan District), Mongolia (Dornot and Gurvanbulag Districts), the United States \n(McDermitt caldera) and Mexico (Pena Blanca District).  \n9.  Metasomatite de posits  are confined to Precambrian shields in areas of tectono- magmatic \nactivity affected by intense Na- metasomatism or K -metasomatism, which produced \nalbitised or illitised facies along deeply rooted fault systems. In Ukraine, these deposits are \ndeveloped  within a variety of basement rocks, including granites, migmatites, gneisses and \nferruginous quartzites, which produced albitites, aegirinites, alkali -amphibolic, as well as \ncarbonate and ferruginous rocks. Principal uranium phases are uraninite, branneri te and \nother Ti -U-bearing minerals, coffinite and hexavalent uranium minerals. The reserves are \nusually medium to large. Examples include Michurinskoye, Vatutinskoye, Severinskoye, \nZheltorechenskoye, Novokonstantinovskoye and Pervomayskoye deposits (Ukrain e), \ndeposits of the Elkon District (Russia), Espinharas and Lagoa Real (Brazil), Valhalla \n(Australia), Kurupung (Guyana), Coles Hill (US), Lianshanguan (China), Michelin (Canada) \nand small deposits of the Arjeplog region in the north of Sweden.  \n10. Surfici al deposits  are broadly defined as young (Tertiary to Recent), near -surface uranium \nconcentrations in sediments and soils. The largest of the surficial uranium deposits are in calcrete (calcium and magnesium carbonates) found mainly in Australia (Yeelirrie  deposit) \nand Namibia (Langer Heinrich deposit). These calcrete -hosted deposits mainly occur in \nvalley -fill sediments along Tertiary drainage channels and in playa lake sediments in areas \nof deeply weathered, uranium -rich granites. Carnotite is the main ur aniferous mineral. \nSurficial deposits also occur less commonly in peat bogs, karst caverns and soils.  \n  \nGLOSSARY OF DEFINITIONS AND TERMINOLOGY  \nURANIUM 202 2: RESOURCES, PRODUCTION AND DEMAND, NEA No. 7634, ©  OECD 20 23 547 11. Carbonate deposits  are hosted in carbonate rocks (limestone, dolostone). Mineralisation can \nbe syngenetic stratabound or more commonly structure -related within karsts, fractures, \nfaults and folds. The only example of a stratabound carbonate deposits is the \nTummalapalledeposit in India, which is hosted in phosphatic dolostone. At Mailuu -Suu, \nKyrgyzstan and Todilto, United States. Another example includ es deposits developed in \nsolution collapse breccias occurring in limestone with intercalations of carbonaceous shale \nsuch as the Sanbaqi deposit, China.  \n12. Collapse breccia -type deposits  occur in cylindrical, vertical pipes filled with down -dropped \nfragme nts developed from karstic dissolution cavities in underlying thick carbonate layers. \nThe uranium is concentrated as primary uranium ore, mainly uraninite, in the permeable \nbreccia matrix, and in the arcuate, ring -fracture zone surrounding the pipe. The pi tchblende \nis intergrown with numerous sulphide and oxide minerals variably containing Cu, Fe, V, Zn, \nPb, Ag, Mo, Ni, Co, As and Se. Type examples are the deposits in the Arizona Strip north of \nthe Grand Canyon and those immediately south of the Grand Canyo n in the United States. \nResources are small to medium (300 -2 500 t) with grades around 0.20- 0.80%.  \n13. Phosphate deposits  are principally represented by marine phosphorite of continental -shelf \norigin containing syn -sedimentary, stratiform, disseminated ura nium in fine -grained \napatite. Phosphorite deposits constitute large uranium resources (millions of tons), but at a \nvery low grade (0.005- 0.015%). Uranium can be recovered as a by -product of phosphate \nproduction. Examples include the Land Pebble District, F lorida (land -pebble phosphate) (US), \nGantour (Morocco) and Al- Abiad (Jordan). Another type of phosphorite deposits consists of \norganic phosphate, including argillaceous marine sediments enriched in fish remains that \nare uraniferous (Melovoye, Kazakhstan). Deposits in continental phosphates are not \ncommon.  \n14. Lignite -coal deposit s consist of elevated uranium contents in lignite/coal mixed with mineral \ndetritus (silt, clay), and in immediately adjacent carbonaceous mud and silt/sandstone beds. \nPyrite and ash  contents are high. Lignite -coal seams are often interbedded or overlain by \nfelsic pyroclastic rocks. Examples are deposits of the south -western Williston basin, North \nand South Dakota (US), Koldjat and Nizhne Iliyskoe (Kazakhstan), Freital (Germany), \nAmba ssador (Australia) and the Serres basin (Greece).  \n15. Black shale deposits  include marine, organic -rich shale or coal -rich pyritic shale, containing \nsynsedimentary, disseminated uranium adsorbed onto organic material, and fracture -\ncontrolled mineralisation  within or adjacent to black shale horizons. Examples include the \nuraniferous alum shale in Sweden and Estonia, the Chattanooga shale (United States), the Chanziping deposit (China) and the Gera -Ronneburg deposit (Germany).  \n \nLIST OF ABBREVIATIONS AND ACRONYMS   \nURANIUM 202 2: RESOURCES, PRODUCTION AND DEMAND, NEA No. 7634, ©  OECD 20 23 549 Appendix  4.

Countries around the world \nuse it to reliably generate low-carbon electricity, process heat and hydrogen as part of their plans to \nreduce carbon emissions and increase energy security and supply. There is no nuclear fission power \npossible – of whatever kind – without uranium. \nThis 29th edition of the “Red Book”, a recognised world reference on uranium jointly prepared by the \nNuclear Energy Agency (NEA) and the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), provides analyses \nand information from 54 uranium producing and consuming countries. The present edition reviews \nworld uranium market fundamentals and presents data on global uranium exploration, resources, \nproduction and reactor-related requirements. It offers updated information on established uranium \nproduction centres and mine development plans, as well as projections of nuclear generating capacity \nand reactor-related requirements through 2040.\n \nNEA\nNUCLEAR ENERGY AGENCY\nNEA No. 7634Nuclear Energy Agency (NEA)\n46, quai Alphonse Le Gallo  \n92100 Boulogne-Billancourt, France\nTel.: +33 (0)1 45 24 10 15\nnea@oecd-nea.org  www.oecd-nea.or gUranium 2022: Resources, Production and Demand\n",
