Atoms themselves are made up\nof three particles called protons, neutrons, and electrons. An atom has a nucleus (or core) containing protons and\nneutrons, which is surrounded by electrons. Protons carry a positive electrical charge and electrons carry a negative\nelectrical charge. Neutrons do not have an electrical charge. Enormous energy is present in the bonds that hold the\nnucleus together. This nuclear energy can be released when those bonds are broken. The bonds can be broken\nthrough nuclear fission, and this energy can be used to produce electricity.\nIn nuclear fission, atoms are split apart, which releases energy. All nuclear power plants use nuclear fission, and most\nnuclear power plants use uranium atoms. During nuclear fission, a neutron collides with a uranium atom and splits it,\nreleasing a large amount of energy in the form of heat and radiation. More neutrons are also released when a uranium\natom splits. These neutrons continue to collide with other uranium atoms, and the process repeats itself over and over\nagain. This process is called a nuclear chain reaction. This reaction is controlled in nuclear power plant reactors to\nproduce a desired amount of heat.\nhttps:/www.eia.gov/kids/energy-sources/uranium/ 48\n\n2/13/25, 4:22 AM Uranium (nuclear) - Energy Kids: U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA}\nHow’ fission splits:the uranium:atomi\n: SourcevAdapted from.

Fusion is the source of energy in the sun and stars. Developing technology to harness nuclear fusion as a\nsource of energy for heat and electricity generation is the subject of ongoing research, but whether or not it will be a\ncommercially viable technology is not yet clear because of the difficulty in controlling a fusion reaction.\nNuclear fuel—uranium\nhttps:/www.eia.gov/kids/energy-sources/uranium/ SMB\n\n2/13/25, 4:22 AM Uranium (nuclear) - Energy Kids: U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA}\nUranium is the fuel most widely used by nuclear plants for nuclear fission. Uranium is considered a nonrenewable fal\nenergy source, even though it is a common metal found in rocks worldwide. Nuclear power plants use a certain kind of\nuranium, referred to as U-235, for fuel because its atoms are easily split apart. Although uranium is about 100 times\nmore common than silver, U-235 is relatively rare.\nMost U.S. uranium ore is mined in the western United States. Once uranium is mined, the U-235 must be extracted\nand processed before it can be used as a fuel.\nBACK TO TOP:\nNuclear power plants\nContainment dome of a nuclear reactor\nae oe breae | 4\n\"p< Hess fh ig \"\ninte) ar\nSMES ADE dices nies OAT ad\nSource: Stock photography (copyrighted)\nNuclear power comes from nuclear fission\nNuclear power plants heat water to produce steam. The steam is used to spin large turbines that generate electricity.\nNuclear power plants use heat produced during nuclear fission to heat water.\nhttps:/www.eia.gov/kids/energy-sources/uranium/ 68\n\n2/13/25, 4:22 AM Uranium (nuclear) - Energy Kids: U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA}\nIn nuclear fission, atoms are split apart to form smaller atoms, releasing energy. Fission takes place inside the reactor fal\nof a nuclear power plant. At the center of the reactor is the core, which contains uranium fuel.\nThe uranium fuel is formed into ceramic pellets. Each ceramic pellet produces about the same amount of energy as\n150 gallons of oil. These energy-rich pellets are stacked end-to-end in 12-foot metal fuel rods. A bundle of fuel rods,\nsome with hundreds of rods, is called a fuel assembly. A reactor core contains many fuel assemblies.\nThe heat produced during nuclear fission in the reactor core is used to boil water into steam, which turns the blades of\na steam turbine. As the turbine blades turn, they drive generators that make electricity. Nuclear plants cool the steam\nback into water in a separate structure at the power plant called a cooling tower, or they use water from ponds, rivers,\nor the ocean. The cooled water is then reused to produce steam.\nNuclear power plants generate about 20% of U.S. electricity\nAs of August 1, 2023, 93 nuclear reactors were operating at 54 nuclear power plants in 28 states. Of the 54 operating\nnuclear power plants, 19 have one reactor, 31 have two reactors, and 4 have three reactors. Learn more about the\nU.S. nuclear energy industry.\nThe United States generates more nuclear power than any other country\nIn 2021, 33 countries had commercial nuclear power plants, and in 15 of those countries, nuclear energy supplied at\nleast 20% of their total annual electricity generation. The United States had the most nuclear electricity generation\ncapacity and generated more nuclear electricity than any other country. France had the second-largest nuclear\nelectricity generation capacity and third-highest nuclear electricity generation. In addition, France had the world's\nhighest nuclear share—about 68% —of total national annual electricity generation.\nTop five nuclear electricity generation countries in 2021\n\nhttps:/www.eia.gov/kids/energy-sources/uranium/ THB\n\n2113/25, 4:22 AM Uranium (nuclear} - Energy Kids: U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA)\nCountry Nuclear electricity generation capacity (million Nuclear electricity generation (billion Nuclear share of country's total electricity fal\nkilowatts) kilowatthours) generation\nUnited 95.49 778.15 19%\nStates\nSource: U.S. Energy Information Administration, International Energy Statistics, as of August 7, 2023\nBACK TO TOP\nTypes of nuclear reactors\n° oye\nDiagram of a boiling water nuclear reactor\nhitps:/Awww.eia.gov/kids/energy-sources/uranium/ 88\n\n2/13/25, 4:22 AM Uranium (nuclear) - Energy Kids: U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA}\nit | = “NG\na—,|\n| i “1 Seperstons es\n= 4 aa : ift== aps Jurblee Gaventor\n! =| = fetta NI he call\nPhe. ae”\n| * Recireatation hirmpi 2 {|\nSource: U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (public domain)\nDiagram of a pressurized nuclear water reactor\nhttps:/www.eia.gov/kids/energy-sources/uranium/ ons\n\n2/13/25, 4:22 AM Uranium (nuclear) - Energy Kids: U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA}\npee ” a\nPare Aan | | “i | =\nF _ ee i ie 4\nalga\nDieist [ul = pu — pS All 7\nSource: U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (public domain)\nNuclear reactors are machines that contain and control nuclear chain reactions while releasing heat at a controlled\nrate.\nA nuclear power plant uses the heat that a nuclear reactor produces to turn water into steam, which then drives turbine\ngenerators that generate electricity.\nU.S. nuclear power plants use two types of nuclear reactors\nNuclear power plants in the United States have either a boiling-water reactor or a pressurized-water reactor.\nBoiling-water nuclear reactors\nIn a boiling-water reactor, the reactor core heats water, which turns directly into steam in the reactor vessel. The steam\nis used to power a turbine generator.\nhttps:/www.eia.gov/kids/energy-sources/uranium/ 10/18\n\n2/13/25, 4:22 AM Uranium (nuclear) - Energy Kids: U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA}\nPressurized-water nuclear reactors fl\nIn a pressurized-water reactor, the reactor core heats water and keeps it under pressure to prevent the water from\nturning into steam. This hot radioactive water flows through tubes in a steam generator.\nAsteam generator is a giant cylinder filled with nonradioactive water (or clean water). Inside the giant water-filled\ncylinder are thousands of tubes filled with the hot radioactive water from the reactor core that eventually bring the\nclean water to a boil and turn it into steam.\nThe radioactive water flows back to the reactor core to be reheated, and once reheated, returns to the steam\ngenerator. The clean water may come from one of several sources like oceans, lakes, or rivers.\nWhat are small modular reactors?\nThe U.S. Department of Energy is supporting the design, certification, and commercialization of small modular reactors\n(SMRs). SMRs are about one-third the size of the reactors that are operating and under construction in the United\nStates. SMRs have simple, compact designs that can be assembled in a factory and transported by train or truck to\nthe power plant site. The size and simplicity of the SMRs could reduce the time it takes to construct a new nuclear\npower plant.\n\nBACK TO TOP:\n\nGetting (producing) uranium\nThe United States imports most of the uranium it uses as fuel\nUranium is the fuel most widely used by nuclear power plants for nuclear fission.

The fal\nrisk of this happening at nuclear power plants in the United States is small because of the diverse and redundant\nbarriers and safety systems in place at nuclear power plants, the training and skills of the reactor operators, testing\nand maintenance activities, and the regulatory requirements and oversight of the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory\nCommission. A large area surrounding a nuclear power plant is restricted and guarded by armed security teams. U.S.\nreactors also have containment vessels that are designed to withstand extreme weather events and earthquakes.\nNuclear power reactors do not produce direct carbon dioxide emissions\nUnlike fossil fuel-fired power plants, nuclear reactors do not produce air pollution or carbon dioxide while operating.\nHowever, the processes for mining and refining uranium ore and making reactor fuel all require large amounts of\nenergy. Nuclear power plants also have large amounts of metal and concrete, which require large amounts of energy\nto manufacture. If fossil fuels are used for mining and refining uranium ore, or if fossil fuels are used when constructing\nthe nuclear power plant, then the emissions from burning those fuels could be associated with the electricity that\nnuclear power plants generate.\nNuclear energy produces radioactive waste\nA major environmental concern related to nuclear power is the creation of radioactive wastes such as uranium mill\ntailings, spent (used) reactor fuel, and other radioactive wastes. These materials can remain radioactive and\ndangerous to human health for thousands of years. Radioactive wastes are subject to special regulations that govern\ntheir handling, transportation, storage, and disposal to protect human health and the environment. The U.S. Nuclear\nRegulatory Commission (NRC) regulates the operation of nuclear power plants.\nRadioactive wastes are classified as low-level waste or high-level waste. The radioactivity of these wastes can range\nfrom a little higher than natural background levels, such as for uranium mill tailings, to the much higher radioactivity of\nused (spent) reactor fuel and parts of nuclear reactors. The radioactivity of nuclear waste decreases over time through\na process called radioactive decay. The amount of time it takes for the radioactivity of radioactive material to decrease\nto half its original level is called the radioactive half-life. Radioactive waste with a short half-life is often stored\nhttps:/Awww.eia.gowkids/energy-sources/uranium/ 16/18\n\n2/13/25, 4:22 AM Uranium (nuclear) - Energy Kids: U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA}\ntemporarily before disposal to reduce potential radiation doses to workers who handle and transport the waste. This fal\nstorage system also reduces the radiation levels at disposal sites.\nBy volume, most of the waste related to the nuclear power industry has a relatively low level of radioactivity. Uranium\nmill tailings contain the radioactive element radium, which decays to produce the radioactive gas radon. Most uranium\nmill tailings are placed near the processing facility, or milf, where they come from. Uranium mill tailings are covered\nwith a sealing barrier of material such as clay to prevent radon from escaping into the atmosphere. The sealing barrier\nis covered by a layer of soil, rocks, or other materials to prevent erosion of the sealing barrier.\nThe other types of low-level radioactive waste are the tools, protective clothing, wiping cloths, and other disposable\nitems that become contaminated with small amounts of radioactive dust or particles at nuclear fuel processing facilities\nand nuclear power plants. These materials are subject to special regulations for their handling, storage, and disposal\nso they will not come in contact with the outside environment.\nHigh-level radioactive waste consists of irradiated, or spent, nuclear reactor fuel (i.e., fuel that is no longer useful for\nproducing electricity). The spent reactor fuel is in a solid form, consisting of small fuel pellets in long metal tubes called\nrods.\nSpent reactor fuel storage and reactor decommissioning\nSpent reactor fuel assemblies are highly radioactive and, initially, must be stored in specially designed pools of water.\nThe water cools the fuel and acts as a radiation shield. Spent reactor fuel assemblies can also be stored in specially\ndesigned dry storage containers. An increasing number of reactor operators now store their older spent fuel in dry\nstorage facilities using special outdoor concrete or steel containers with air cooling. The United States does not\ncurrently have a permanent disposal facility for high-level nuclear waste.\nWhen a nuclear reactor stops operating, it must be decommissioned. Decommissioning involves safely removing from\nservice the reactor and all equipment that has become radioactive and reducing radioactivity to a level that permits\nhttps:/www.eia.gov/kids/energy-sources/uranium/ 178\n\n2/13/25, 4:22 AM Uranium (nuclear) - Energy Kids: U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA}\nother uses of the property. The U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission has strict rules governing nuclear power plant fal\ndecommissioning that involve cleanup of radioactively contaminated power plant systems and structures and removing\nthe radioactive fuel.\nBACK TO TOP\nx Ask Energy Ant about energy. »\nhttps:/www.eia.gov/kids/energy-sources/uranium/ 18/18\n\n",
