However, the responsibility for any remaining errors remains with the\nauthors.\n\nThe project coordinator wishes to express his sincere gratitude to his co-authors for their\ninvaluable contributions and creative thinking.\n\nThe report represents the perspective and opinion of the contractor and does not necessarily\nreflect the opinion of the orderer (German Federal Ministry for Environment, Nature\nConservation and Reactor Safety).\n\nExecutive Summary and Conclusions\n\nThe future of the nuclear energy industry is subject to a large number of media reports,\nstudy projects, expert meetings and political debates. Much of the published data is based\non speculation rather than on an in-depth analysis of nuclear energy's industrial history,\ncurrent operating status and trends.\n\nThe World Nuclear Industry Status Report 2009 provides the reader with the basic\nquantitative and qualitative facts on the nuclear power plants in operation, under\nconstruction and in planning phases throughout the world. A detailed overview assesses\nthe economic performance of past and current nuclear projects.\n\nAs of 1“ August 2009 there are 435 nuclear reactors operating in the world, nine less than\nin 2002. There are 52 units listed by the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) as\n“under construction”. At the peak of the nuclear industry's growth phase in 1979 there\nwere 233 reactors being built concurrently. Even at the end of 1987, there were still\n120 reactors in process. Much has changed. For the first time since commercial use of\nnuclear energy began in the middle of the 1950s no new nuclear plant was connected to the\ngrid in 2008. In fact, no start-up has been reported for the past two years, since Cemavoda2\nwas connected to the grid on 7 August 2007, after 24 years of construction.\n\nIn 1989 a total of 177 nuclear reactors had been operated in what are now the 27 EU\nMember States, but as of 1* August 2009 only 144 units were in operation. Today the\nworldwide operating reactors total 370,000 megawatts (370 GW), about 1,600 MW\" less\nthan one year ago.\n\nIn 2007 nuclear power plants generated about 2,600 TWh? and provided 14% of the\nworld's electricity. After an unprecedented drop in electricity generation of 2% in 2007,\nnuclear power plants’ output lost another half percentage point in 2008. Nuclear power\nprovided 5.5% of the commercial primary energy production and about 2% of the final\nenergy in the world, and has trended downwards for several years.\n\nTwenty-seven of the 31 countries operating nuclear power plants maintained (23) or\ndecreased (4) their share of nuclear power within the electricity mix in 2008 relative to\n2007. Four countries (Czech Republic, Lithuania, Romania, Slovakia) increased their\nshare.\n\nThe average age of the operating nuclear power plants in the world is 25 years. Some\nnuclear utilities envisage reactor lifetimes of 40 years or more. Considering the fact that\nthe average age of all 123 units that have already been closed is about 22 years, the\ndoubling of the operational lifetime seems rather optimistic. However, we have assumed an\naverage lifetime of 40 years for all operating and in-construction reactors in our\ncalculations of how many plants would be shut down year by year. The exercise makes\npossible an evaluation of the minimum number of plants that would have to come on-line\nover the next decades in order to maintain the same number of operating plants.\n\nIn addition to the 52 units currently under construction’, 42 reactors (16,000 Mwy would\nhave to be planned, built and started up by 2015 — one every month and a half — and an\nadditional 192 units (170,000 MW) over the following 10-year period — one every 19 days.\n1 The equivalent of an EPR (European Pressurized Water Reactor), as under construction in Finland and\nFrance.\n\n? Terawatthours or billion kWh.\n\n3 In contrast to earlier scenarios, we have considered that aif units currently listed by the IAEA as “under\nconstruction” will be connected to the grid by 2016.\n\nIn a new “PLEX? Scenario” we have modeled the situation taking into account not only the\nstart-up of all units currently under construction, but also the license renewal as of\nAugust 2009 of 54 US and some other nuclear reactors®. Even with license renewals, the\nnumber of units in operation would never again reach the historical peak of 444 in 2002.\nBy 2015, the number of operating units in the world would be 10 short of the current level,\nthough the installed capacity would increase by 9,600 MW. In the following decade an\nadditional 174 reactors or about 152,000 MW would still have to be replaced to break even\nwith the current nuclear fleet in the world.\n\nEven if Finland and France each builds a reactor or two, China goes for an additional\n20 plants and Japan, Korea or Eastern Europe add a few units, the overall worldwide trend\nwill most likely be downwards over the next two decades. With extremely long lead times\nof 10 years and more, it will be practically impossible to maintain, let alone increase the\nnumber of operating nuclear power plants over the next 20 years. The one exception to this\noutcome would be if operating lifetimes could be substantially increased beyond 40 years\non average; there is currently no basis for such an assumption.\n\nFor practically all of the potential nuclear newcomers, it remains unlikely that fission\npower programs can be implemented any time soon within the required technical, political,\neconomic framework. None of the potential new nuclear countries has proper nuclear\nregulations, an independent regulator, domestic maintenance capacity, and the skilled\nworkforce in place to run a nuclear plant. It might take at least 15 years to build up the\nnecessary regulatory framework in countries that are starting from scratch.\n\nFurthermore, few countries have sufficient grid capacity to absorb the output of a large\nnuclear plant, an often-overlooked constraint. This means that the economic challenge to\nfinancing a nuclear plant would be exacerbated by the very large ancillary investments\nrequired in the distribution network.\n\nCountries with a grid size and quality that could apparently cope with a large nuclear plant\nin the short and medium term encounter an array of other significant barriers. These\ninclude a hostile or passive government (Australia, Norway, Malaysia, Thailand);\ngenerally hostile public opinion (Italy, Turkey); international non-proliferation concerns\n(Egypt, Israel); major economic concerns (Poland); a hostile environment due to\nearthquake and volcanic risks (Indonesia); and a lack of all necessary infrastructure\n(Venezuela). Many countries face several of these barriers at the same time.\n\nLack of a trained workforce and massive loss of competence are probably the most\ndifficult challenges for proponents of nuclear expansion to overcome. Even France, the\ncountry with perhaps the strongest base of civilian nuclear competence, is threatened by a\nsevere shortage of skilled workers. Demographics are a big cause: a large number of\n\"baby-boomers\" are approaching retirement — about 40% of the nuclear staff of the\nworld’s largest nuclear utility EDF by 2015. Currently, a maximum of 300 nuclear\ngraduates are available for some 1,200 to 1,500 open positions. An additional difficulty\nstems from the fact that the number of nuclear graduates does not correspond at all to the\navailability of new recruits for the nuclear industry. In the USA for example only about\none quarter of the 2008 nuclear graduates planned to actually work in the industry or a\n* Units currently under construction range from 32 MW to 1600 MW, with an average of 880 MW, roughly\nthe same as the average capacity of operating units with 855 MW. While it seems impossible to maintain the\noperating number of nuclear reactors under these conditions until 2015, an additional sixteen 1,000 MW units\nwould be sufficient to maintain the installed nominal capacity. All of these units would have to start\nconstruction over the coming year and all be completed in optimal construction times. This seems unlikely\nconsidering the past experience but not impossible.\n\n5 Plant Life Extension\n\n© Plus authorized lifetime extensions in the Netherlands, Spain and the UK.\n\nnuclear utility. Many prefer either to continue their studies or to join the military or other\ngovernment and business sectors,\n\nThe situation is similar or worse in most of the other nuclear countries.\n\nAt least in the short term, severe manufacturing bottlenecks (only one facility in the world,\nJapan Steel Works, can cast large forgings for certain reactor pressure vessels) further\nhamper any practical nuclear revival.\n\nThis report covers, in addition to the subjects in earlier editions, an economic analysis of\npast, present and likely future nuclear projects. While many industries experience declining\ncosts as they move out their technological learning curve, the nuclear industry continues to\nface steadily increasing costs on existing construction and future cost estimates. The\nMay 2009 nuclear investment cost estimate update by the Massachusetts Institute of\nTechnology (MIT) simply doubled an earlier estimate from $2,000 to $4,000 overnight\ncost (excluding financing) per installed kilowatt.\n\nIn fact reality has already bypassed projections. The flagship EPR project at Olkiluoto in\nFinland, managed by the largest nuclear builder in the world, AREVA NP, has turned into\na financial fiasco. The project is more than three years behind schedule and at least 55%\nover budget, reaching a total cost estimate of €5 billion ($7 billion) or close to €3,100\n($4,400) per kilowatt.\n\nThere are numerous ways by which governments have organized or tolerated subsidies to\nnuclear power. They range from direct or guaranteed government loans to publicly funded\nresearch and development (R&D). Direct ownership of subsidized nuclear fuel chain\nfacilities, government funded nuclear decommissioning and waste management, generous\nlimited liability for accidents and the transfer of capital costs to ratepayers via stranded\ncost rules or special rate-basing allowances are all common in many countries,\n\nThe current international economic crisis is exacerbating many of the problems that the\nproponents of the nuclear energy option are facing. At this point, there is as yet no obvious\nsign that the international nuclear industry could eventually turn the empirically evident\ndecline into a promising future.\n\n|. Introduction\nThe future of the global nuclear industry is subject to extensive media speculation, industrial\nannouncements and political debate. However, there seems to be a widening gap between the\nindustrial reality with its current trends and the widespread perception of some sort of “nuclear\nrenaissance”. In September 2008, the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) issued a press\nrelease that perfectly illustrates the point: “The IAEA has revised upwards its nuclear power\ngeneration projections to 2030, while at the same time it reported that nuclear’s share of global\nelectricity generation dropped another percentage point in 2007 to 14%.” While the IAEA figure\nfor 2008 is not available yet, it is obvious that the relative significance of nuclear power in the\nglobal cnergy balance has continucd to decline.\nAre these just short-term tendencies rather than structural developments? What are the projections\nfor the role of nuclear power in world energy and how realistic are they? New units are being built,\nbut will they be delivered in time and on budget? Will there be enough of them to replace the aging\nreactor fleet? These are questions that the World Nuclear Industry Status Report has analyzed in\nprevious years’ and analyzes in the present version.\nIn addition, the German Federal Ministry of Environment, Nature Conservation and Reactor Safety\n({BMU) has requested that the 2009 analysis include as well a special focus on economic issues.\nWith roots of the current international economic crisis linked to inadequate transparency and poor\nincentive structures in credit markets, it is imperative to properly understand the competitiveness of\na technology such as nuclear that requires high capital input and generates equally high financial\nrisksII. General Overview Worldwide\n\nA nuclear power renaissance? Maybe not.\n\nFortune Magazine, 22 April 2009°\nIn June 2008 the [AEA announced that world nuclear electricity generation had plunged by 2% in\n2007 — more than in any other year since the first fission reactor was connected to the Soviet grid in\n1954, The EU region saw an even sharper decline of 6%. The drop by about 60 TWh corresponds\nto the average annual generation of ten reactors; or to more than what two thirds of the countries\nthat operate atomic plants generate individually. The major influencing factors included: the seven\nunits at Kashiwasaki in Japan that have remained shut down ever since a severe earthquake shook\nthe region in July 2007; up to six German reactors that were off grid simultaneously for major\nrepairs; and numerous French reactors that had to undergo inspections and maintenance after a\ngeneric problem was identified in the steam generators. The latter issue is expected to cost the\nFrench nuclear fleet another 2-3% on its average load factor in 2008 and 2009. Global nuclear\ngeneration did not recover in 2008 and lost another half percentage point over the 2007 level.\nThough the \"big six\" nuclear generators, the USA, France, Japan, Germany, Russia and South-\nKorea, still generated about two thirds of the world's nuclear electricity in 2007 and 2008, the\nfigure was down from three fourths in previous years.\nI.1. Overview of Operation, Power Generation, Age Distribution\nThere have been two major waves of grid connections since the beginning of the commercial\nnuclear age in the middle of the 1950s (see Graph 1). A first wave peaked in 1974 with 26 reactor\n7 Mycle Schneider, “The World Nuclear Industry Status Report 2008”, The Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists,\nNovember-December 2008, http://www. thebulletin.org/web-edition/reports/2008-world-nucleat-industry-\nstatus-report.\nMycle Schneider with Antony Froggatt, “The World Nuclear Industry Status Report 2007”, commissioned by\nthe Greens-EFA in the European Parliament, Brussels-Paris-London, January 2008; French Version February\n2008; Italian, Spanish Versions April 2008, http:/Avww.greens-\nefa.org/cms/topics/rubrik/6/6659.energy@en.htm .\nEarlier versions were released in 2004 by the Greens-EFA Group in the European Parliament and in 1992\njointly by World Watch Institute, Washington, Greenpeace International and WISE-Paris.\nSee http://money.cnn.com/2009/04/22/technology/nuclear.fortune/index.htm .\n\nstartups. The second one reached the historical record in 1984 and 1985, the years preceding the\nChemobyl accident in 1986, with 33 grid connections each year. By the end of the 1980s the\nuninterrupted net increase of operating units had ceased, and in 1990 for the first time the number\nof reactor shutdowns outweighed the number of startups.\nGraph 1: Nuclear Power Reactor Grid Connections and Shutdowns\nReactor Startups and Shutdowns in the World\n40 In Units, from 1956 to 1# August 2009\n3s Reactor Startup -\nReactor Shutdown i\n30 |\n2s |__|\n20 ti ——_p-MHi\n15 - —|\n: AAT laliidestsitelss\nbeaded! /AAIIUARTUMI ASU MIATA Ahaha lh 0.\nPb 3 & 3 2 3 33\n2 2 e 2 2 & RR\n© Mycle Schneider Consulting Source: IAEA-PRIS’, MSC, 2009\nGraph 2: The World Nuclear Reactor Fleet\ncwe |Nuclear Reactors & Net Operating Capacity in the World humber of\nIn GWe, from 1954 to 1 August 2009\n400 a70GWe 500\n444 reactor 435 reactors\n350 322GWe A “\n426 reactors naar\n] 400\n300\ni 380\n250 Reactors In operation | 300\n— Operable capacity\n200 {J rs. | | 250\n150\n100\n+00\n| THE AAA\n; Ne ee AEE ETER RTA AERETTREnE ;\nPs 8 & 3 3a 8s 3\n2 2 2 2 22 a & &\n© Mycle Schneider Consulting Source: IAEA-PRIS, MSC, 2009\n° The IAEA Database PRIS (Power Reactor Information System):\nhttp://www. iaea.org/programmes/a2/index.html.\n\nAs of 1* August 2009, a total of 435 nuclear reactors were operating (nine fewer than 2002) in\n31 countries, with a total capacity of 370 gigawatts (thousand megawatts) (see Graph3 and\nAnnex 1 for details). 2008 was the first year in the history of commercial nuclear power that no\nnew nuclear plant came online.’® The historical peak of 294 operating reactors in Western Europe\nand North America was reached as early as 1989. In fact, the decline of the ‘established’ nuclear\nindustry, unnoticed by the public, started many years ago.\n\nThe IAEA is required to publish data that is provided by member states, and this can sometimes\ngenerate data anomalies. A few years back, the Agency created a new reactor category of “long\nterm shutdown” to add to its existing characterizations of “in operation” and “under construction”.\nHowever, a reactor that is listed in the category as operating does not necessarily generate\nelectricity and long term shutdown can be very long. This results in a number of serious statistical\nproblems that can be illustrated for the year 2008:\n\n¢ Five units are officially in “long term shutdown” mode, including four in Canada and one\nin Japan. The Canadian units have not generated power since 1995 (Bruce-1) and 1997\n(Bruce-2, Pickering-2 and -3) respectively. Likewise the Japanese Monju fast breeder\nreactor has been shut down ever since sodium leak and fire in 1995.\n\n* Atleast 17 units that were listed by the IAEA as “in operation” did not generate any power\nin 2008. Of these, ten are in Japan, four in India, two in Germany and one in the UK.\nThirteen reactors have been out of service for over one year, one for over two years, two\nfor over four years and one has not generated any power since 2001 (see Table 1). In fact,\nChubu Electric, operator of two reactors at Hamaoka in Japan, on 22 December 2008,\nofficially announced its decision to terminate operations “since it would not be economical\nto restart them”.\"\"\n\nThe installed capacity increased slightly in previous years. This has primarily occurred through\ntechnical alterations at existing plants, a process known as \"uprating\". According to the World\nNuclear Association (WNA), in the USA the Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) has approved\n124 uprates since 1977, a few of them \"extended uprates\" of up to 20%. As a result an additional\n5.6 gigawatts were added to the nuclear capacity in the USA alone.”\nTable 1: Reactors “in operation” that did not generate any power in 2008\nCounts Station Name Production.\nGermany Brunsbitttel (KKB) no production in 2008\nKriimmel (KKK) no production in 2008\n2\nIndia Narora-2 no production in 2008\nRajasthan-1 no production after 2004\nRajasthan-2 no production in 2008\nRajasthan-3 no production in 2008\n4\nJapan Hamaoka-1 no production after 2001\nHamaoka-2 no production after 2004\nKashiwazaki Kariwa-1 no production after earthquake in July 2007\nKashiwazaki Kariwa-2 no production aller earthquake in July 2007\nKashiwazaki Kariwa -3 no production after earthquake in July 2007\nKashiwazaki Kariwa -4 no production after earthquake in July 2007\nKashiwazaki Kariwa-5 no production after earthquake in July 2007\nKashiwazaki Kariwa -6 no production after earthquake in July 2007\nKashiwazaki Kariwa -7 no production after earthquake in July 2007\nShika-1 no production in 2008\nio\nUK Oldbury-A. no production after 2006\ni\n©@Mycle Schneider Consulting Source: Nucleonics Week, 12 Feb 2009, IMEA-PRIS 2009\n1 With the exception of the year 1955, when no unit started up, after in 1954 the first small reactor (5 MW)\nhad been connected to the grid in the USSR.

A\nnumber of countries including Belgium, Germany and Switzerland have applied extensive uprating.\nFrance plans a major uprating program between 2008 and 2015 that should add between 3% (at\nfive 900 MW units) and 7% (at the twenty 1300 MW units) capacity. Similar programs are\nunderway in Finland, Spain and Sweden. The nominal capacity of Oskarshamn-3 in Sweden, for\nexample, will be boosted by 21% to 1450 MWe.\n\nThe capacity of the global fleet increased annually between the years 2000 and 2004 by about\nthree gigawatts, much of it through uprating. Capacity increases dropped to two gigawatts per year\nin net additions between 2004 and 2007; and uprates were offset by plant closures in 2008,\nresulting in a net world nuclear capacity decline of about 1.6 gigawatts'? in 2008.\n\nThese figures should be compared to the global power market place. The total electricity generating\ncapacity under construction in 2007 has been estimated at over 600 gigawatts.'* Of this, the vast\nmajority was from coal, hydro and natural gas plants; the nuclear share was roughly 4.4%.\n\nThe use of nuclear energy has been limited to a small number of countries in the world. Only\n31 countries, or 16% of the 192 United Nations Member States, operate nuclear power plants (see\nGraph 3). Half of the world’s nuclear countries are located in the EU and account for almost half of\nthe world’s nuclear production.\n\nThere was no growth in the nuclear electricity generation in 2008, at 2,600 TWh\", corresponding\nin 2007 to about 14% of the world's commercial electricity. This represents a decline from 15% in\n2006 and 16% in 2005. 2008 generation comprised 5.5% of total commercial primary energy and\nonly about 2% of final energy'® Only four countries (Czech Republic, Lithuania, Romania,\nSlovakia), operating together 13 units, increased their nuclear share in the power mix in 2008 over\nthe previous year. Twenty-three countries remained stable (less than one percent change) and in\nfour countries the role of nuclear power declined (Armenia, Japan, Sweden, UK). For details by\ncountry, see Annex 1.\n\nThe increasing operational problems nuclear operators have encountered over the last two years, in\nparticular in France, Germany and Japan, do not seem to have dampened the widespread official\nenthusiasm in favor of nuclear power. As the statement of the last G8 meeting in Hokkaido in July\n2008 points out; \"In the last few years we have witnessed that a growing number of countries\nworldwide have expressed their interest in nuclear energy as a means for addressing climate change\nand energy security concems. It is acknowledged that while the appropriate energy mix depends\nupon each country’s situation and policy, there is clearly a rising interest in nuclear energy.\" The\nJAEA has reported that over 50 countries have demonstrated interest in nuclear energy.\n\n8 The equivalent of an EPR reactor (see hereunder).\n\n¥4 Platts, “World Electric Power Plants Database”, January 2008, quoted in OECD-IEA, “World Energy\nOutlook 2008”, August 2008, p. 144.\n\n15 Terawatt hours = billion kilowatt hours.

International Nuclear Expansion Scenarios\nWe were here to discuss the promised ‘Nuclear Renaissance’ -\nwithin the US, this Renaissance has yet to come about...\nRobert Rosner\nDirector, Argonne National Laboratory\nApril 2009\nThe international nuclear community remains generally confident in a positive future. “Increasing\nenergy demand, concems over climate change and dependence on overseas supplies of fossil fuels\nare coinciding to make the case for nuclear build stronger. Rising gas prices and greenhouse\nconstraints on coal have combined to put nuclear power back on the agenda for projected new\ncapacity in both Europe and North America,” says the WNA.\"®\nThe nuclear industry is not alone to proclaim its “renaissance”. Over the last years, several\ninternational assessments of the possible future of nuclear power in the world have been adjusted to\nmore optimistic prospects for 2030,\nThe OECD International Energy Agency’s World Energy Outlook (WEO) provides an annual\nanalysis of world energy markets and trends. Recent WEO reports have had very optimistic\nassumptions on nuclear energy in all presented scenarios. The 2007 WEO version’ presented a\n“teference scenario”, an “alternative policy scenario” and a “450 stabilisation case” that include\nrespectively 415 GW”, 525 GW and 833 GW of nuclear power.

But the\nshare of nuclear power in world electricity generation would drop from some 14% in 2007 to 13%\nin 2015 and to 10% in 2030, while nuclear share in commercial primary energy supply would drop\nfrom 6% to 5% over the same period. WEO estimated that the growth in nuclear capacity would\ntake place outside the EU. Inside the EU, nuclear capacity was projected to decline from 131 GW\ntoday to 89 GW in 2030 and generation from 795 TWh to 667 TWh. This scenario would\neffectively cut the nuclear share in the EU in half, from 30% in 2006 to 16% in 2030.\nThe World Energy Outlook 2008 introduces an intermediate “550 Policy Scenario”. Nuclear power\nwould represent 540 GW installed that generate 4,166 TWh” in 2030, 20% more than in the\nreference scenario. The new “450 Policy Scenario” envisages 680 GW of installed nuclear\ncapacity, more than doubling the rate of build-up in the “550 Policy Scenario”, generating over\n5,200 TWh by 2030, twice as much as in 2008 but covering still only 18% of the total\nconsumption. Both of these scenarios are much more optimistic for nuclear power than only a few\nyears earlier.\nConsider that the 2006 version of the World Energy Outlook had noted that “nuclear power will\nonly become more important if the governments of countries where nuclear power is acceptable\nplay a stronger role in facilitating private investment, especially in libcralised markets” and “if\nconcems about plant safety, nuclear waste disposal and the risk of proliferation can be solved to the\nsatisfaction of the public.””\nSimilarly, a 2007 report commissioned by the InterAcademy Council, a research body that\ncoordinates among national academies of science, stated: “As a low-carbon resource, nuclear\npower can continue to make a significant contribution to the world’s energy portfolio in the future,\nbut only if major concerns related to capital cost, safety, and weapons proliferation are addressed.”\nThe Council concluded that... “no certain conclusion regarding the future role of nuclear energy\nemerges, except that a global renaissance of commercial nuclear power is unlikely to materialize\nover the next few decades without substantial support from governments”.*\nThe US Department of Energy (DOE), in its 2007 edition of the International Energy Outlook\n(EO), forecasts 438 GW of nuclear capacity by 2030, “in contrast to projections of declines in\nnuclear power capacity in past IEOs”.”> The 2008 IEO envisages that 498 GW of nuclear capacity\ngenerate 3,800 TWh by 2030, about 10% more than in the OECD-IEA reference case projection”,\nHowever, the 2008 IEO also notes:\n“Still, there is considerable uncertainty associated with nuclear power. Issues that\ncould slow the expansion of nuclear power in the future include plant safety,\nradioactive waste disposal, and the proliferation of nuclear weapons, which continue\nto raise public concerns in many countries and may hinder the development of new\nnuclear power reactors. Moreover, high capital and maintenance costs may keep some\nnations from expanding their nuclear power programs.”””\nThe International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) has revised its forecasts several times over the\nlast years and in its most recent projections anticipates 473 GW of nuclear capacity in its “low”\nscenario and, with admirable precision, 747.5 GW in its “high” scenario by 2030.\" The rate of\n2!

In fact, even the lower figure corresponds to a significant challenge considering\nthe current age structure of operating units — see Graph 5. None of the scenarios provide\nappropriate analysis of necessary and very substantial increases in nuclear related education,\nworkforce development, manufacturing capacity and public opinion shifts.\n1.3. Overview of Current New-build\nNuclear power is unlikely to play a critical role in limiting COz\nequivalent\nconcentrations in the atmosphere until mid-century at the earliest ...\nNo realistic plan foresees a reactor build rate that allows nuclear power\nto help stay below 550 ppme CO, within the next ~30-40 years®.\nRobert Rosner\nDirector, Argonne National Laboratory\nApril 2009\"\nThe construction sites in the 15 countries that currently build nuclear power plants are\naccumulating substantial and costly delays. As of 1 August 2009, the IAEA lists 52 reactors as\n“under construction\", 18 more than at the end of 2007. As a matter of comparison, the JAEA listed\n120 units as under construction at the end of 1987 and a peak of 233 units with over 200 GW under\nconstruction in 1979 (see Graph 4). The year 2004, with 26 units under construction, represented\nthe smallest figure for in-construction units since the beginning of the nuclear age in the 1950s.\nThe total capacity of the units under construction is about 46 GW with an average size of\nca. 880 MW per unit (see Annex 2 for details). A closer look at the currently listed projects\nillustrates the level of uncertainty associated with reactor building:\n\n¢ 13 reactors, one quarter of the total, have been listed as \"under construction” for over\n20 years. The US unit Watts Bar-2 project holds the record with an original construction\nstart in December 1972 (subsequently frozen), followed by the Iranian Bushehr plant that\nwas originally started by German company Siemens in May 1975 and is now to be finished.\nby the Russian nuclear industry. The list of long-term construction projects further includes\nfour Russian units, the two Belene units in Bulgaria, two Mochovee units in Slovakia and\ntwo Khmelnitski units in Ukraine. In addition, two Taiwanese units at Lungmen have been.\nlisted for 10 years,\n\n* 24 projects don't have an official (IAEA) planned start-up date, including five of the nine\nRussian projects, the two Bulgarian reactors and 13 of the 16 Chinese units under\nconstruction.

The remaining units were started within the\nlast five years and have not reached projected start-up dates yet. This makes it difficult or\nimpossible to assess whether they are running on schedule.\n\n* Over two thirds (36) of the units under construction are listed in four countries alone\n(China, India, Russia, South-Korea). All of these nations have historically not been very\ntransparent about the status at their construction sites.\n\nThe geographical distribution of the nuclear power plant projects is concentrated in Asia and\nEastern Europe, extending a trend from earlier years. Between 2004 and 2007 a total of 14 units\nwere started up, all in these two regions. Forty-seven of the 52 reactors currently \"under\nconstruction\" are located there as well.\n\nEstimating construction times is not straightforward. Taking a global average—it would be over\nnine years for the 14 mast recent grid connections—does not make much sense because of the\ndifferences between countries. The construction period for four reactors that started up in Romania,\nRussia and Ukraine lasted between 18 and 24 years. In contrast, it took five years on average to\ncomplete the ten units that were connected to the grid in China, India, Japan and South Korea.\n\nLead times for nuclear plants include not only construction times but also long term planning,\nlengthy licensing procedures in most of the countries, complex financing negotiations and site\npreparation. In addition, in most cases the grid system has to be upgraded; often new high-voltage\npower lines have to be built with their own planning and licensing difficulties. In some cases public\nopposition is significantly higher for the long distance power lincs to move the clectricity than for\nthe generating station itself.\n\nProjected completion times should be viewed skeptically, and past nuclear planning estimates have\nrarely turned out to be accurate. The USA provides one recent example. In 2001 George W. Bush\nlaunched the Nuclear Power 2010 program. According to the Department of Energy's (DOE)\nOctober 2001 Roadmap, the objective was to \"complete construction and deploy multiple\ncommercially viable new nuclear plants by 2010\", and, as a minimum scenario, to deploy “at least\none light water and at least one gas-cooled reactor\", Reality is quite different and it is obvious now\nthat no new plant will be up and running in the USA by 2010.\n\n35 The LAEA erroneously indicates GW as the unit for installed capacity in the graph's caption.\n\nAs of August 2009, the US Nuclear Regulatory Commission had received 17 applications for a\nCombined Construction and Operating License (COL) for a total of 26 units.>* However, as the\nDOE points out: “Submitting an application does not ensure a reactor will be built (or even\nstarted).”*7\nOnly one unit is currently planned to operate under a new license before 2015. NRG plans to start\nconstruction at its South Texas site as early as 2009 with grid connection planned for 2014. NRG's\nCOL is currently under review by the NRC. \"COL filings often include a goal to ‘keep the nuclear\noption open’ rather than a full commitment\". ** The capital market service company Moody’s\nexpects extensive legal cases: “We believe the first COL filing will be litigated, which could create\nlengthy delays for the rest of the sector.” In late 2007 the London Financial Times obtained\nconfidential government documents that confirm a similar situation in the UK: “Fresh legal\nchallenges are expected to hamper plans to build new nuclear power stations in the UK.””\nGraph 5: Age Distribution of Operating Reactors\n45 |Age of the 435 Reactors In Operation In the World\nas of 1\" August 2009\n40\nas\nwu\ncil\n30\n5\n2 2 Mean Age: 25 Years Fs) 4\nre 2 zo\n3 fe]\ni 20 18, v\n2 “ 1s is\n15 2 13] h\n30\n10 8 9\n6 6 6 sss zz $ Zz 6 z\n“baal LAA\n2 2\nGauaUOUDOCUIUL H\n2345 6 7 8 9 109142131415.1647 10 1920.21 22.23.2425 2827 28.29 5031 32 3334 95 3637 28 304041 42\n© Mycle Schneider Consulting Source: IAEA-PRIS, MSC, 2009\nGraph 6: Age Distribution of Shutdown Reactors\nas of 1% August 2009\n0\nMean Age: 22 Years\noo\ne —\n3\ni\n5 6\n53\n5\n24\no Hd | i ctl Ht | i COT | | nin\n0 2 4 & & 10 42 14 48 18 20 22 24 26 28 3032 34 38 38 40 42 AB AB\n© Mycle Schneider Consulting Source: I4EA-PRIS, MSC, 2009\n* See http:/Avww.nre.gov/reactors/new-reactors/col.html , accessed 8 August 2009,\n37 DOE, “Status of Potential New Commercial Nuclear Reactors in the United States\", 19 February 2009.\n> Tbidem,\n% Financial Times, 24 October 2007.\n\nPast experience has shown that a reactor order or even advanced stage of construction is no\nguarantee for grid connection and power supply. The French Atomic Energy Commission (CEA)\npublished statistics on “cancelled orders” through 2002. By the time they ended the data series, the\nCEA listed 253 cancelled orders in 31 countries, many of them in advanced construction stage. The\nUSA alone accounts for 138 cancellations.” Many utilities in the USA suffered grave financial\nharm over reactor building projects.\n\nIn the absence of any significant new build and grid connection over many years, the average age\n(since grid connection) of operating nuclear power plants in the world has been increasing steadily\nand stands now at about 25 years.\"\n\nSome nuclear utilities envisage reactor lifetimes of 40 years or even up to 60 years. The OECD’s\nWorld Energy Outlook 2008 has given a 40 to 50 year time frame with an average 45 years\nexpected operation. In the USA reactors are usually licensed to operate for a period of 40 years.\nNuclear operators in the USA can request a license renewal that can be granted by the Nuclear\nRegulatory Commission for an additional 20 years. As of early August 2009, a total of 54 units in\nthe USA had received a license renewal to extend operation by 20 years. In many countries there\nare no time limitations to operating licenses. In France, for example, reactors have to undergo an\nin-depth inspection and testing every decade. The first operating French PWR was started up in\n1977, so 30-year inspections have just begun. The French nuclear safety authorities consider it\npremature to discuss lifetimes beyond 40 years. “We found it funny that the first time EDF began\ntalking about extending the lifetime of reactors past 40 years was to financial analysts in London,”\nAndre-Claude Lacoste, president of the French Nuclear Safety Authority (ASN), stated in April\n2009. “It wouldn’t be a bad thing for them to bring us a technical file on this”, he added.” ASN\nintends to evaluate reactor-by-reactor to see whether they can operate for more than 30 years, At\nthis stage the question of lifetimes beyond 40 years is considered irrelevant by ASN, although EDF\nhas clearly stated that it will prioritize lifetime extension over massive new build.\n\nIn assessing the likelihood of reactors being able to operate for up to sixty years, it is useful to\ncompare the age distribution of reactors currently operating and those that have already shut down\n{see Graphs 5 and 6). At present, only two operating reactors in the world have exceeded the 40-\nyear mark“?, These two reactors, Oldbury-1 and -2, are scheduled for closure within two years.\nSeven additional units have reached age 40. So while a wave of reactors will reach four decades of\noperation over the next 10 years — 135 units have reached age 30 or more — there is hardly any\noperational experience with longer operating times.\n\nThe age structure of the 123 units already shut down confirms the picture. In total 26 of these units\noperated for 30 years or more; and within that subset, 15 reactors operated for 40 years or more\n{see Graph 6). All 14 but one (a 5 MW Russian unit) are Magnox reactors in the UK, most of\nwhich had been used for the generation of weapons grade plutonium. These were all small reactors\nbetween 50 MW and 225 MW that had operated with very low burn-up fuel, and therefore are not\ncomparable to large 900 MW or 1300 MW commercial reactors using high burn-up fuel that\ngencrates significantly more stress on materials.\n\nWhile many units of the first generation have operated for only a few years or less, even the\noperating experience beyond 30 years is very limited.\n\nConsidering the fact that the average age of all 123 units that have already been closed is about\n22 years, plans to nearly double the operational lifetime of so many units seems rather optimistic.\nHowever, for the purposes of capacity projections one can assume an average lifetime of 40 years\nfor operating reactors, with a few adjustments. The remaining 17 German units, for example,\naccording to German legislation will be shut down after an average operational lifetime of about\nCEA, “Eleenue — Nuclear Power Plants in the World”, 2002 Edition, 2002.\n\n4!

In addition to the 52 units under construction® as of 1* August 2009, 42 reactors\n(15,900 MW) would have to be planned, built and started up prior to 2015. This corresponds to one\nnew plant every month and a half, with an additional 192 units (170,000 MW) over the following\n10-year period — one every 19 days.\nGraph 7: The 40-Year Lifetime Projection\nore Number of\n7900 Projaction 2009-2056 of Nuclear Raactor Numbors/Capacity| aes\n‘ Operating and Under Construction In the World In 2009\nGeneral assumption of 40 years of mean lifetime + German phase-out\n2,000 fin Mive and number of units) 2\n: cin kd ld iL lJ Mey HW] Way V Le\n8,000 N 1 Wi ¥ hth 8\n\\ fl 4\n+=13,000 13\ni Reactors added - shut-down\n18,000 } i f \\ '—copaclty connsction- shut-down| 18\n-23,000 F 2\nNet balance\n728,000 7. 2009-2015. -»}4+-—— 2016 - 2025 N a2 2=§ + | ™\nvas,900 MWe <izopoomwe pi <134;000 Be\n“Az reactors 192 reactors 202 reactors\n=33,000 33\n© Mycle Schneider Consulting Sources: IAEA-PRIS, WNA, MSC 2009\nGraph 8: The PLEX Projection\n‘i omer\nProjection 2009-2056 of Nuclear Reactor Numbers/Capacity\n7,000 Oporating and Under Construction in the World in 2009 ?\npe |Genora! assumption of 40 years of mean Hifotime + 54 USA units 60 years + Gorman phase-out\n2,000 YN In Miva and number of units) 2\nn\noo Ny 7 y mini Pal pe\nUN | Wire U i hi 4\n8,000 N ' hat a\nl il) s\na |\n-13,000 | ————— | —— =F ye AA ts\n18,000 li I U l f i SReactors added shutdown 18\n“23,000 — Capacity connection shuttown a\nNet balance N\n28,000 ul 28\n= 2009-2015 —e)e—— 2016 = 2025 —e | 2026 - 2056 (ie\n+9,600 MWe: 152,000 MWe 227,000 MWe\nsoon Lidenctors 2474 reactors 2252 reactors wa\n© Mycle Schneider Consulting Sources: [AEA-PRIS, US-NRC, WNA, MSC 2009\n“ We have used the currently available official projection of individual reactor shutdown dates.\nTy carlier versions of this report, we have not included units that were listed as under construction but\nremained without official IAEA start-up dates, In the present scenario ai of the currently listed units enter\noperation, by 2016.

However, the average construction time for the first\n10 operating units was 6.3 years. Even in the case of further significant advances in building times,\nin order to be operational by 2020, construction of all of the units would need to have started before\n2015, At present, about half of the additional 31 GW is currently under construction. Construction\nfor [6 units totaling 15.2 GW started only over the last four years. Building volume would have to\ndouble in order to meet China’s ambitious goal - a prospect that seems unlikely” although not\nentirely impossible considering recent building acceleration. But even such an extraordinary\nundertaking in terms of capital investment, technical and organizational challenge would replace\nonly 10% of the number of units that reach age forty around the world within the timeframe\nconsidered.\nA nuclear utility-sponsored analysis carried out by the Keystone Center pointed out that to build\n700 GW of nuclear power capacity “would require the industry to return immediately to the most\nrapid period of growth experienced in the past (1981-90) and sustain this rate of growth for\n50 years,”\"* The international industry lobby organization WNA thinks it can do it and more: “It is\nnoteworthy that in the 1980s, 218 power reactors started up, an average of one every 17 days. (...)\nSo it is not hard to imagine a similar number being commissioned in a decade after about 2015. But\nwith China and India getting up to speed with nuclear energy and a world energy demand double\nthe 1980 level in 2015, a realistic estimate of what is possible might be the equivalent of one\n1000 MW unit worldwide every 5 days.”\nIt is questionable whether this can be called a “realistic estimate\". The situation in the second\ndecade of the 21 Century will be radically different from the 1980s. In the early days of the\nindustry, less was known about the financial and technical challenges of the nuclear fuel chain, and\nthis vacuum provided the industry with substantial leeway. The nuclear utilities benefitted from the\nability to pass much of the investment risk onto ratepayers, to defer nuclear waste and plant\ndecommissioning concerns, and did not face competition from non-utility generators and\ncompetitive electricity markets. Given capital losses on past waves of nuclear construction in the\nhundreds of billions of dollars, and obvious remaining challenges with waste management,\nproliferation, and financing, challenge to nuclear grand plans is inevitable.\nMany analysts consider that the historic key problems with nuclear power have not been overcome\nand will continue to constitute a severe disadvantage in global market competition. Additional, new\ndifficulties have arisen in particular from market liberalization and the recent economic crisis.\nKen Silverstein, Director of the US-based consultancy Energy Industry Analysis wrote:\n“As a result of deregulation of power and other market- and policy-based\nuncertainties, no nuclear power company can afford to take the financial risk of\nbuilding new nuclear plants. A report published by Standard & Poor's identifies the\nbarriers. The financial costs for construction delays, for example, could add untold\nsums to any future project. That, it says, would also increase the threats to any lender.\nTo attract new capital, future developers will have to demonstrate that the perils no\nlonger exist or that energy legislation could successfully mitigate them. Peter Rigby, a\nStandard & Poor’s analyst and author of the report says: ‘The industry's legacy of cost\ngrowth, technological problems, cumbersome political and regulatory oversight, and\nthe newer risks brought about by competition and terrorism concerns may keep credit\ntisk too high for even (federal legislation that provides loan guarantees) to\novercome’,””°\n* Sco http://www.chinadaily.com.cn/china/2007-10/16/content_6177053.htm .\n* A certain number of units currently in the planning stage or in early construction phase are of designs that\nhave never been completed elsewhere (e.g. EPR, AP1000).\n8 Bradford, et al. “Nuclear Power Joint Fact-Finding”, Keystone Center, June 2007.\n® See http://www.world-nuclear.org/info/inf17.html .\n® UtiliPoint International, 21 June 2004.\n\nIn 2005 the USA passed legislation in order to stimulate investment in new nuclear power plants.\nMeasures include a tax credit on the first 6 GW of new electricity generation, a 100% federal loan\nguarantee of up-to-80%-debt financing for up to $20.5 billion in nuclear-related assets,” additional\nsupport in case of significant construction delays for up to six reactors and the extension of limited\nliability (Price Anderson Act) until 2025 (see section III. for details).\nThe licensing procedure has been simplified to avoid the lengthy processes of the past. The public\ninterest group Public Citizen views the new licensing conditions not only as a heavy subsidy to the\nindustry (see chapter IIL.) but as a serious impediment to the democratic decision making process.\n“The Combined Construction and Operating License, or COL, is part of a new, ‘streamlined’\nprocess designed to encourage construction of new nuclear power plants by heavily subsidizing\nnuclear owners and removing opportunities for the public to raise important safety concerns. By\ncombining what were previously two steps - construction and operation - there is no chance for the\npublic to raise concerns about problems with the actual construction process after it begins. By the\ntime the shovel hits the dirt, the reactor is already approved to start up.”*”\nThe renewal of the aging world nuclear fleet or even the extension of the operating power plants\nencounters three major problems: a short term manufacturing bottleneck, a dramatic skilled\nworker/manager shortage and a skeptical financial sector. Other issues include widely fluctuating\ncosts for raw materials, the aftermath of the Chernobyl disaster, and the new dimension of the\nthreat of nuclear terrorism, The world economic crisis exacerbates these problems further, in\nparticular in potential “newcomer” countries.\n1.4, Overview of Potential Newcomer Countries\nWe have a very good president in France, Monsieur Sarkozy.\nHe is our best commercial guy for nuclear.\nHe is going in all countries and selling nuclear plants.\nColette Lewiner\nGlobal Energy, Utilities and Chemicals Leader, Capgemini\nLondon, June 20089\nPretty soon you will have nine weapons states\nand probably another 10 or 20 virtual weapons states.\nMohamed ElBaradei\nDirector General, IAEA\nVienna, May 2009\nNumerous countries have expressed interest in nuclear power in recent years, According to the\nIAEA, 12 countries are “actively preparing for nuclear power” and a further 38 countries have\n“indicated an interest in the possible introduction of a nuclear power plant”.** Of these 51 countries\n17 are from the Middle East to the Pacific, 13 are from Africa, 11 are European and nine are in\nLatin America.\nBetween 2006 and 2008 alone, the IAEA has received requests for technical cooperation from\nsome 43 Member States.

However, even after the shutdown of Ignalina, power\n\nconsumption in the other countries would not justify the construction of a large nuclear plant.\n\nFinancing is also a major issue.\n\nBelarus, the country that was worst hit by the Chernobyl disaster in 1986, has received offers for a\n\nnuclear plant from Atomstroyexport, AREVA and Westinghouse.\n\nTwenty-three potential newcomer countries operate at least one research reactor, which can be\n\nconsidered as one of the prerequisites for the operation of a commercial plant. If we look at the\n\n11 countries that operate small nuclear programs with one or two reactors (see Table 3), only two\n\ncountries, Armenia and Lithuania, operate commercial size reactors but no research reactors. Both\n\nwere former republics of the Soviet Union and profited extensively from the technical expertise,\n\nthe legal framework and the integrated power grid of the larger federation, The same countries plus\n\nSlovenia are the only ones to operate power grids that are smaller than 10,000 MW and where the\n\nrespective nuclear unit corresponds to more than 10% of the installed capacity in the country.\n\nSlovenia, formerly part of Yugoslavia, was equally integrated into a much larger framework.\n\nBulgaria operates two units, which each represent about 8.5% of the total installed capacity.

In\n\nother words, 10% seems already a rather extreme value for the largest unit in a given country.\n\nOf 38 potential nuclear newcomer countries listed by the WNA, 15 don’t have nuclear experience\n\non research-reactor level and 20 have an electricity grid that is smaller than 10,000 MW.“ The\n\nfollowing 17 countries have both research-reactor experience and larger than 10,000 MW grids (see\n\nAnnex 3): Australia, Chile, Egypt, Indonesia, Israel, Italy, Kuwait, Malaysia, Norway, Philippines,\n\nPoland, Portugal, Thailand, Turkey, United Arab Emirates, Venezuela, Vietnam.\n\nWhat are the prospects of a nuclear power program in these countries?\n\n@ TABA, “Rescarch Reactor Data Base”, accessed 9 May 2009.\n\n% TABA, “International Status and Prospects of Nuclear Power”, 2008.\n\n® The IAEA has counted 28 potential candidate countries with grid systems of less than 10,000 MW.\n\nAustralia is a large uranium producer but the introduction of nuclear power always faced\nsignificant controversy. A December 2006 report to the Prime Minister, the Switkowski Report®,\nsuggested the rapid introduction of a nuclear power program in the country. An international panel\nof experts, including three of the authors of this report®, concluded that the Switkowski Report was\nhighly biased and that the targets were unrealistic.” Nothing has happened since. Any significant\nfollow-up over the coming 20 years in industrial terms is highly unlikely. Switkowski\nacknowledged in March 2009 that once the people accepted nuclear power “it would be at least\nanother 15 years before a reactor could be built’.® In fact, the newly elected Australian\ngovernment will put that timeframe even further away. As Martin Ferguson, Minister for Resources\nand Energy has recently restated, “the Government has a clear policy of prohibiting the\ndevelopment of an Australian nuclear power industry”.\n\nIt has been reported that in November 2007 the Chilean President asked the Energy Minister to\nlook into the nuclear power option. A modest effort seems ongoing, as in 2009 the government\nallocated CP$430 million (US$665,000) to study nuclear power. Even such a minor expenditure\nraised significant criticism by the environmental community in the country.” There are no short or\nmedium term prospects for a nuclear power program,\n\nIn Egypt it is already 35 years since the first nuclear power plant was proposed. The plan never\nmaterialized. More recently Egypt signed nuclear cooperation agreements with Russia and China.\nIn December 2008 the government announced that it had selected the US company Bechtel (later\ntransferred to Worley Parsons) to provide assistance in selecting a reactor provider and to train\nstaff. A 1,000 MW plant is planned to start up by 2017.\n\nNuclear power projects in Indonesia have a 20-year history. In 1989 the National Atomic Energy\nAgency (BATAN) carried out the first studies. In 2007 the Korea Electric Power Corp (KEPCO)\nagreed to develop a new feasibility study for two 1,000 MW reactors. Cooperation agreements\nwere also signed with Japan and Russia. Indonesia’s Minister for Research and Technology was\nquoted in March 2008 as stating that the country would need four 1,200 MW units by 2025 and that\nthe first one was to go online by 2016. Construction would have to start in 2008. “Otherwise, we\nwill be behind schedule”, he stated.” Indonesia will be behind schedule. No call for tender has\nbeen announced yet. The nuclear plans have raised concerns and protests because of intense\nvolcanic and earthquake activities in the areas envisaged to host a plant, in particular in Central\nJava. There is little prospect for near or medium term nuclear power plant operation and no target\ndates have been announced.\n\nIsrael has developed a full-scale nuclear weapons program and thus has strong nuclear capabilities.\nSeveral arguments speak against a short and medium term nuclear power program in the country.\nWith a grid size of just 10,000 MW a nuclear plant would be clearly oversized. The country has not\nsigned the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty and is therefore technically isolated. Nuclear power\nplants are sometimes called pre-deployed nuclear weapons. There are few places where this\nperspective seems more pertinent than in the case of Israel. And finally, Israel is a major player in\nthe renewable cnergy sector.

Four EPRs could be built with construction starting as\nearly as 2013, under an agreement signed in February 2009 by the French utility EDF and the\nlargest Italian utility ENEL. However, Italy is the only country that shut down its nuclear program\nafter the Chernobyl accident in 1986 and a referendum in 1987 reinforced the decision. Four\noperational reactors and four units under construction were abandoned and no nuclear electricity\nwas generated after 1987. Twenty years later, Italy continues to face significant decommissioning\nand waste management costs. There is no final repository for high-level waste and the public\nremains hostile. Italy had built up a significant nuclear industry and still has a strong nuclear lobby.\nMore recently ENEL announced investments in nuclear plants outside the country, in particular in\nthe Slovak Mochovee plant and the French Flamanville-3 unit. This strategy seems much more\nrealistic than any short or medium term revival of nuclear power in Italy itself.”\n\nKuwait announced plans in March 2009 to set up a national nuclear energy commission and has\nintroduced draft legislation to achieve this. The country is in the very early stages of designing a\npossible nuclear power policy. With only 11,000 MW, its grid is very small. Applications in the\nshort and medium term arc unlikely.\n\nThe Indian nuclear industry has stated that it would be ready to assist Malaysia in developing a\nnuclear power program “if there is a genuine interest, as nuclear power production is a long term\ncommitment\". There are no short or medium term perspectives or ambitions.\n\nIn Norway a government appointed committee recommended in February 2008 that “the potential\ncontribution of nuclear energy to a sustainable energy future should be recognized.””* However, as\nthe OECD’s Nuclear Energy Agency’s Norway country profile states: “Norway does not have a\nnuclear power generation programme.”\n\nThe Philippines abandoned a nuclear power project in the past. A 600 MW Westinghouse reactor,\nBataan-1, was ordered in 1974 and building started in 1976. The nearly complete project was\nabandoned by the incoming Aquino government days after the Chernobyl accident in 1986.\nHowever, payments apparently continued until 2007”. In February 2008 the IAEA visited the site\nat the request of the Philippine government. There have been successive attempts from Members of\nCongress to introduce bills mandating the rehabilitation of the plan, the latest in December 2008.\n\"The government has to assess what the new licensing requirements should be, how to modernize\nthe two-decades old technology to current standards, and how to confirm that all aspects of the\nplant will function properly and safely. It is not the IAEA’s role to state whether the plant is usable\nor not, or how much it will cost to rehabilitate\", the IAEA stated.”® The power plant site is close to\nan earthquake prone zone and the dormant Pinatubo volcano. Considering the disastrous experience\nwith the initial investment, the absence of an appropriate nuclear framework (legislation, safety\nauthorities, etc.) and significant opposition against the project in the country, it seems unlikely to\ngo ahcad,\n\nPoland ordered five Russian designed reactors between 1974 and 1982. Work started on two units\nat Zarnowiec but all orders were officially cancelled by 1990.

No new realistic time frame nor financing schemes are\navailable. No call for tender has been issued.\n\nIn Portugal “in 2004 the government rejected a proposal to introduce nuclear power but this is now\nbeing reviewed”, writes the WNA.® However, Portuguese public opinion is overwhelmingly\nopposed to nuclear power and there are no plans. As the OECD’s Nuclear Energy Agency’s\nPortugal country profile states: “Portugal does not have a nuclear power generation programme.”™\nIn Thailand there have been nuclear power plans since the 1970s, none of which ever materialized.\nUnder the previous government, the energy minister revived plans for the construction of four\nnuclear reactors with a total of 4,000 MW coming online by 2020-2021.” However, the incoming\ngovernment has not reiterated any of these plans,\n\nWhile the IAEA does not identify the countries in the various categories in Table 2, it is clear that\nTurkey is the only potential newcomer country that has already launched a call for tender. But in\nSeptember 2008 it had received only one offer, by the Russian Atomstroyexport (ASE), amongst\nthe six potential bidders. In principle, the procedure had to go back to the starting point, since\nTurkish law does not allow for the attribution of such a contract if there is only one bidder.\nHowever, negotiations have been continuing around the offer from the Russian consortium, which\nincludes ASE, Inter RAO UES and the Turkish company Park Teknik. The bid, based on the BOO.\n(Build-Own-Operate) model, covers the construction of four 1200 MWe AES-2006 VVER reactors\nto be built near Mersin in the Akkuyu district. In February 2009 the project was subject to\ndiscussions between the Russian and Turkish presidents. Financing of the project remains a key\nproblem. It has been reported® that the initial Russian offer was to sell the power from the to-be-\nbuilt plant at a price that would represent more than three times the current wholesale power price\nin Turkey. A revised offer would still be more than double current wholesale levels. However,\nAkkuyu was the location of an earlier abandoned nuclear project that was based on a 100% pre-\nfinancing scheme and still failed. Turkey lacked, and continues to lack, consistent nuclear\ninfrastructure and the project received fierce opposition by the local population. The latest proposal\nonly revived the local protests.\n\nThe United Arab Emirates (UAE), following recommendations by the IAEA, set up a Nuclear\nEnergy Program Implementation Organization (NEPIO) and the Emirates Nuclear Energy\nCorporation (ENEC) as a public entity with initial funding of US$ 100 million; and it has initiated\nsteps to develop nuclear legislation. The move is following a government position paper on the\n“Evaluation and Potential Development of Peaceful Nuclear Energy”. By 2020, the Emirates\nenvisages operating three 1,500 MW units, but no decision was taken as of middle of May 2009.\nAlthough the UAE has signed a far-reaching nuclear cooperation agreement with France, there is\nstrong resistance in the US Congress to the implementation of a similar agreement signed by the\nprevious US administration at the very end of its term on 15 January 2009. “Given the UAE’s past\nhistory as the major transshipment point for goods destined for Iran’s nuclear and missile\nprograms, serious concerns remain about its eligibility for a nuclear cooperation agreement with the\nUS.”, stated Congresswoman Ileana Ros-Lehtinen, the ranking Republican member of the House\n” PGE was counting then on an installed kW cost of €2,500-€3,000, a costing figure that since has increased.\nsignificantly (see section III.).\n\n® WNA, “Emerging Nuclear Countries”, May 2009.\n\n§!

The strong bi-partisan opposition in the USA could seriously hamper\nany attempts by the UAE to go ahead with a nuclear power program, even if President Obama has\nofficially authorized implementation.**\nAlso, the UAE would have to very substantially increase overall installed capacity and the grid,\nsince a single 1,500 MW plant corresponds to about 10% of the currently installed capacity.\nVenezuela passed a decree “on Development of the Nuclear Industry” as early as 1975, but never\ndid develop a nuclear power program. In September 2008 President Chavez was quoted as saying\n“se certainly are interested in developing nuclear energy, for peaceful ends of course — for medical\npurposes and to generate electricity”. Russia and France have offered assistance in building up a\nnuclear program in Venezuela. However, apparently there are no concrete decisions or plans yet.\nIn 1996 Vietnam signed an agreement with South Korea for “Cooperation in Research into the\nPeaceful Uses of Nuclear Energy”. Later cooperation agreements were also signed with other\ncountries including Canada, China, France, Japan and Russia. In mid 2008 a nuclear law was\npassed with the view of constructing two 1,000 MW units starting in 2014 with a targeted grid\nconnection of 2018. Vietnam is lacking general nuclear infrastructure and would have to invest\nconsiderably in grid expansion in order to absorb the production of the two units that represent\nalmost 20% of the currently installed capacity.\nIt remains unlikely that any of the potential new nuclear countries can implement fission power\nprograms any time soon within an appropriate technical, political, legal and economic framework.\nNone of the potential newcomer countries have proper nuclear regulations, an independent\nregulator, domestic maintenance capacity and the skilled workforce in place to run a nuclear plant.\nThe head of the French Nuclear Safety Authority has estimated it would take at least 15 years to\nbuild up the necessary regulatory framework in countries that are starting from scratch.\nFurthermore, few countries have sufficient grid capacity to absorb the output of a large nuclear\nplant. This means that the economic challenge of financing a nuclear plant would be exacerbated\nby the large ancillary investments in the distribution network that would be required.\nThe countries that have a grid size and quality that could apparently cope with a large nuclear plant\nin the short and medium term encounter other significant barriers®: a hostile or passive government\n(Australia, Norway, Malaysia, Thailand), an essentially hostile public opinion (Italy, Turkey),\ninternational non-proliferation concerns (Egypt, Israel), major economic concerns (Poland), a\nhostile environment due to earthquake and volcanic risks (Indonesia), lack of all necessary\ninfrastructure (Venezuela). Many countries face several of these barriers at the same time.\n1.5. Status and Trends in Nuclear Manufacturing Capacities\nWhether or not the nuclear renaissance will come to fruition\nis also dependant in large part on the success or failure\nof the industrial infrastructure that provides the necessary parts\nand equipment for construction of a nuclear power plant.\nKristine L, Svinicki\nCommissioner, NRC\nMay 2009”\nThe industrial issue has radically changed since nuclear construction peaked around 1980.

This has resulted in a smaller group of\ncompanies, in fewer countries, with the capability of managing the construction of a complete\nnuclear power plant.\n\nAccording to the American Society of Mechanical Engineers (ASME), the number of ASME\nNuclear Certificates held by companies fell worldwide from nearly 600 in 1980 to less than 200 in\n2007. The decline was essentially due to the loss of US-held certificates, as the number of\ncertificates held in other countries remained rather stable around 100. Since 2007 the number of\nASME certificates has slightly increased to 225, hardly a quantum leap.\"\n\nA US-DOE nuclear power plant construction infrastructure assessment concluded that major\nequipment (reactor pressure vessels, steam generators, and moisture separator reheaters) for the\nnear-term deployment of Generation III? units would not be manufactured by US facilities.\n“Reactor pressure vessel (RPV) fabrication could be delayed by the limited availability of the\nnuclear-grade large ring forgings that are currently only available from one Japanese supplier\n(Japan Steel Works, Limited - JSW). Additional lead-time may need to be included in the reactor\npressure vessel procurement schedule depending on ability of this one supplier to supply the\nrequired reactor pressure vessel large ring forgings in a timely manner. This potential shortfall is a\nsignificant construction schedule risk and could be a project financing risk.”*? The US Nuclear\nRegulatory Commission’s Chairman Dale Klein has also warned that it will take more time to\ninspect foreign made components than to provide quality control at home.**\n\nJSW has supplied about 130 or 30% of the currently operating nuclear reactor vessels in the\nworld. While about 90% of the operational vessels in the USA were manufactured in the country,\nnone of the replacement vessel heads that were ordered after the detection in 2002 of a major hole\nin the Davis Besse vessel head has been manufactured in the USA.\n\nIn fact, only JSW can forge components from ingots up to 450 t as needed for the EPR and other\nGeneration III reactor pressure vessels and it has announced further investments in manufacturing\ncapacity. However, JSW’s annual manufacturing capacity remains unclear. It has been reported\nthat “more modest investments in 2006, 2007, and 2008”, will bring its capacity up to the\nequivalent of four nuclear steam supply system sets (pressure vessel plus steam generators) per\nyear in 2007 and 5.5 sets by 2008. JSW is aiming to produce sufficient forgings to supply the\nequivalent of about 8.5 sets a year by 2010 and the maximum ingot size is to be increased to 650 t.\nAlready by the end of 2007 JSW's capacity for nuclear products was fully booked to the end of\n2010. AREVA has signed an agreement with JSW “until 2016 and beyond” that has provided\nISW “certain confidence on proceeding to the next round of our major capacity expansion\nprogram”.*\n\nThe problem is the term “equivalent” because it is unclear how much of the forging capacity is\ndedicated in practice to new nuclear projects. JSW also supplies, for example, about 100 forgings a\nyear for fossil fucl turbine and gencrator rotors to China alone.\n\nTARA, “Intemational Status and Prospects of Nuclear Power”, 2008.\n\n9! Kristine L. Svinicki, “The Nuclear Renaissance in America”, NRC NEWS, Pacis, 4 May 2009.\n\n? The currently operating generation of nuclear plants is considered Generation II. The EPR under\nconstruction in Finland is considered a Generation III reactor. Other designs under consideration in the USA\ninclude the AP1000 by Westinghouse, the Advanced Boiling Water Reactor (ABWR) and the Economic\nSimplified Boiling Water Reactor (ESBWR) by General Electric (see also chapter ITI).\n\n5% MPR, “DOE NP2010 Nuclear Power Plant Construction Infrastructure Assessment”, 21 October 2005.\n\n° Financial Times, 24 October 2007.\n\n°S WNN, “Japan Steel Works prepares for orders”, 16 May 2007\n\n% According to the trade press, one vendor in China, Erzhong (the former Second Heavy Machinery Works)\nin Dayan, Sichuan, “has announced” that capacity, but evidence remains unclear and the lack of international\nreputation excludes Erzhong de facto as a competitor of JSW on the international market,\n\n5?

AREVA has stated that\n\nthe annual capacity at the Chalon plant is limited to 12 steam generators” plus “a certain number of\n\nvessel heads” and small equipment, or the equivalent of between 2 and 2.5 units per year, if it did\n\nmanufacture equipment for new plants only. In reality, the Chalon capacities are booked out, in\n\nparticular for plant life extension measures — steam generator and vessel head replacement — also\n\nfor the US market.! In July 2007 AREVA announced that the heavy forgings it had ordered in\n\n2006 from JSW for a US-EPR had begun to arrive at its Chalon facility. AREVA claims that the\n\norder of forgings made the company the only vendor to have \"material in hand to support certainty\n\nof online generation in 2015.\"\"\" Since 1973 the Chalon plant has manufactured in total over 600\n\nheavy components including 76 reactor pressure vessels, 63 replacement vessel heads and\n\n292 steam generators. Over 500 of the pieces were installed on French units.\n\nIn July 2008 AREVA announced that it would enlarge its Le Creusot facilities, located in the same\n\nregion as Chalon, in order to increase its annual ingot capacity from 35,000 tons to 50,000 tons.\n\nAREVA claims that while currently “80% of the components required to build an EPR can be\n\nproduced in Le Creusot”, in the future “100% will be manufactured in the region including\n\ncomponents for reactor vessels”. A few months later, AREVA stated that the annual production\n\ncapacity of the Chalon facilities would be upgraded to “an equivalent of 2.7 EPRs, up from around\n\n1?\n\nThe AREVA figures illustrate the difficulty of assessing real manufacturing capacities. AREVA’s\n\ncapacity increases, from components for a maximum of 2.5 Generation II units to those for 2.7\n\nGeneration III EPR units. That looks like a modest increase.\n\nIn the USA, in alliance with Northrop Grumman, AREVA is projecting the construction of a\n\nChalon mirror facility in Newport News, Virginia. The $360 million plant would manufacture\n\nreactor vessels, steam gencrators and pressurizers for future EPRs to be built in the USA. However,\n\nAREVA is facing a severe cash shortage (see sections III & IV) and at this point it is unlikely that\n\nit will be able to follow through with all of its ambitious investment projects. '°*\n\nOther initiatives to correct the obvious bottleneck in manufacturing capacity include:\n\n¢ Chinese firms Harbin Boiler Works, Dongfang Boiler Group and Shanghai Electric Heavy\n\nIndustries Corp. (SEC) are preparing to enter the very large forgings market. At present\nonly two Chinese companies can pour ingots at around 350 tons, of which only SEC is said\nto handle up to 500-ton ingots. In 2008 Chinese manufacturers set an ambitious target for\naround 2015: production of 20 or more sets of pressure vessels and steam generators per\nyear. European and US industry executives that have been working with Chinese firms on\nthe issue believe that such a production rate cannot be achieved until much later. Until\nrecently only one Chinese company, China Erzhong, had ASME certificates for nuclear\nforgings, a key precondition for exports; but the size is limited to 600 MW pressure\nvessels. In early June 2009 Shandong Nuclear Power Equipment Manufacturing Co\nannounced that it got the ASME certification for the manufacturing of AP1000 pressure\nvessels,’ The first four AP1000 vessels for the Chinese market were ordered from a\nmanufacturer in Korea. The 1,000 MW size still remains far short of the 1,600 MW vessels\nfor the EPR.\n\n° Most of the large nuclear plants under construction or in planning have four steam generators.\n\n1 See CPDP, Compte Rendu du Débat Public EPR “Téte de série”, Paris, 29 November 2005.\n\n11 Nucleonics Week, 8 November 2007.\n\n12 AREVA, “AREVA invests in Le Creusot to manufacture EPR reactor vessels in France”, Press Release,\n\n3 July 2008.\n\n1 AREVA, “AREVA launches the Chalon £300 plan”, 2 April 2009.\n\n1 AREVA has already shelved certain projects including, in November 2008, the Midwest uranium mining\n\nproject in Saskatchewan, Canada,\n\n5 WNN, \"Accreditation for Chinese nuclear components\", 5 June 2009.\n\nThe nuclear power sector will have to continue to compete with other industries for new\nforge capacity. Over 90% of the forgings for coal fired plants beyond 600 MW are\nimported into China, mainly from Japan.'®°\n\n* The Russian heavy component manufacturer ZiO-Podolsk, a subsidiary of\nAtomenergomash, is reported to be investing 2.9 billion roubles (€65 million) by 2015 to\nenlarge its capacities to the equivalent of four nuclear island sets per year.'”\n\n+ In early 2009 the Spanish company ENSA signed a strategic agreement with GE-Hitachi\nNuclear Energy (GEH) for the manufacturing of pressure vessels for Advanced Boiling\nWater Reactors (ABWR) and Economic Simplified Boiling Water Reactors (ESBWR). In\nFebruary 2009 JSW delivered the first of six forgings for an ESBWR. ENSA does not\nexpect to complete the pressure vessel until 2012.\n\n¢ In the USA, Westinghouse has signed contracts with Chicago Bridge & Iron (CB&I) for\nthe fabrication of four AP1000 pressure vessels. CB&I claims it has fabricated 75% of the\noperating US reactor vessels and intends to rebuild capacity. Deliveries are planned for\nbetween 2014 and 2018.'* The time lags illustrate the long lead-times involved.\n\n* In the UK the nuclear industry is desperately looking for assistance in gaining back nuclear\ncompetence. The outcome of the tender process for the Finnish EPR at Olkiluoto was a big\nblow to the British industry. Less than 1% of the 2,183 companies involved are based in\nthe UK. AREVA has indicated it is willing to assist the British industry in rebuilding\nqualification.\" Prime Minister Brown visited the Sheffield based Forgemasters in May\n2009. However, no decision has yet been made on whether the company will receive the\nrequested state subsidy of over 20% of the estimated investment cost of £140 million for a\n15,000-ton press. The upgrade would enable it to compete with the most exclusive circle of\nnuclear forges in the world.!”\n\nThe nuclear manufacturing industry is clearly in a state of profound reorganization and up-grading.\nInvestments in heavy equipment manufacturing capacity are very capital intensive. Manufacturers\nwill not go ahead with investments worth hundreds of millions of dollars if they do not have firm\norders for several years ahead. However, the current decline in electricity consumption, limited\ngovernment support, coupled with the growth in the renewable energy market, creates uncertainty\nfor investors in the viability of new nuclear power projects. The recent cancellations of advanced\nprojects in South Africa, Canada and the USA as well as repeated delays in many other projects are\nnot prone either, to establish the indispensable confidence level for the necessary capital-intensive\ninvestments.\n1.6.

In particular, it has to face the problems of\n\nrapid loss of construction and operating competence.\n\nSeveral assessments have confirmed the skills gap as an international problem.\n\nIn 2000 the OECD’s Nuclear Energy Agency (NEA) in a 16-country survey reached an alarming\n\nconclusion:\nIn most countries there are now fewer comprehensive, high-quality nuclear technology\nprogrammes at universities than before. The ability of universities to attract top-\nquality students to those programmes, meet future staffing requirements of the nuclear\nindustry, and conduct leading-edge research in nuclear topics is becoming seriously\ncompromised. (...) Unless something is done to arrest it, this downward spiral of\ndeclining student interest and academic opportunities will continue.'*\n\nThe IAEA launched a number of initiatives in order to tackle the skills and competence issue under\n\nthe term “Nuclear Knowledge Management™.''* In 2004 it sct up an international conference on\n\nnuclear knowledge management that provided a helpful overview with a number of explicit country\n\nreports.!\"® However, while some of the presentations provided interesting background (see\n\nhereunder), conclusions and recommendations remained very general in nature (“IAEA Secretariat\n\nand IAEA Member States must take all possible steps towards nuclear knowledge preservation,\n\ndissemination and sharing through effective participation of experts and individuals”). In 2007 the\n\nIAEA organized a second international event on knowledge management.’!’ An IAEA staff\n\ncontribution still identifies “reliable supply of competent workforce — one of the biggest challenges\n\nfor the entire nuclear power industry”.\"\"* The findings and recommendations by the rapporteur note\n\nthe “growing importance of this topic” and despite a rebound in nuclear energy enrolment, “people\n\nate likely to be the worst bottleneck. Even in ‘established’ nuclear countries, there are generation\n\ngaps”. The conference rapporteur recommends that the IAEA and NEA “‘advertise’ the\n\nrenaissance, to attract young talents”. And he failed to recall a Young Generation Network survey\n\nthat found that over 40% of young professionals in the nuclear industry find their jobs merely\n\n“okay” to “very disappointing”.'”\n\nA 2004 NEA study recognizes that more students graduate in nuclear matters than before but that\n\nstudies in member countries have shown that “in spite of the myriad initiatives underway in the\n\narea of nuclear education and training, more engineers and scientists having nuclear knowledge are\n\nrequired than are graduating,”’”° In-house training is not necessarily an option anymore as the\n\ngeneral competition stiffens:\nAs fewer and fewer high quality technical graduates become available, the\ncompetition for them is ever greater and there are signs already that the nuclear\nindustry is losing out.

As well as losing out directly the industry loses out\nindirectly because this also means that the ability of organisations to circumvent the\nshortage of graduates with a sizeable nuclear component to their degree by hiring good\nquality technical graduates and training them in house is compromised.

Jain, then newly elected President of the World\n\nAssociation of Nuclear Operators (WANO), stated in his acceptance speech in September 2007:\nThe key issues that demand world attention today, in my opinion, are those related to\nthe ageing work force, ageing reactors, global increase in the fleet of nuclear power\nplants and probably, the hesitation of the younger generation to embrace this\ntechnology as a profession. It is also a fact that with the increased tumover of work\nforce, the invaluable tacit knowledge, built up through years of experience, is steadily\nbeing lost. It is therefore absolutely csscntial for all of us to put on our thinking caps\nand evolve methods to tackle these serious issues.!”\n\nA March 2008 Capgemini report concluded:\nThe stage is set for a worldwide ‘talent war’ in all industries and nuclear power will\nneed to attract its reasonable share in order to support the renaissance. (...)\nStimulating interest among the Millennial workforce to come to the nuclear power\nsector and ramping up university programs will take five to ten years, but the industry\nwill probably need to raise attention through a new reactor concept before such\ninterest occurs.'*\n\nTo date the NEA has not updated its 2004 report, but intends to do so by the end of 2010.!7\n\nSurprisingly the European Nuclear Education Network (ENEN) has not produced any up-to-\n\ndate international statistical data on nuclear education either. ENEN, based at the French Atomic\n\nEnergy Commission (CEA) in France, was set up in 2003 with the mission to preserve and further\n\ndevelop expertise in the nuclear fields by higher education and training, and counts 51 member\n\norganizations, Accordingly ENEN has set up a European MSc in Nuclear Engineering. In\n\nSeptember 2008 ENEN summed up the situation five years after its founding:\nAt present, all stakeholders of the nuclear community in Europe (vendors, utilities,\nsuppliers, regulators, national and European bodies, safety organizations, consultants,\netc.) have a tremendous demand for qualified junior engineers — and basically all\nstakeholders have serious difficulties in meeting their demands.'?°\n\nThe World Nuclear University (WNU) was started up in 2003 with the mission to enhance\n\ninternational education and leadership in the peaceful applications of nuclear science and\n\ntechnology.

These estimates do not include additional resources necessary to\nsupport new plants.) For the first time in 30 years the US NRC has to review new license\napplications. As for US federal employees in general, a third of the NRC staff is eligible for\nretirement over the next five years. In fact 15% of the NRC workforce is currently retirement\neligible. “The obvious point here is that many of the NRC staff involved in those original licensing\nreviews have retired or are rapidly approaching retirement”, says Commissioner Kristine L.\nSvinicki.!?\n\nKeynote speakers at the American Nuclear Society's 2007 Annual Meeting pointed out that “a\nnuclear renaissance is far from being a sure thing”. °° Art Stall, Florida Power & Light Company's\nsenior vice president and chief nuclear officer, told the event's opening plenary that the euphoria\nthat has surrounded the nuclear renaissance has been slowed down by the realities of the challenges\nthat are involved in building new nuclear power plants. “Stall said one of the biggest challenges is\nfinding qualified people, including craft labor, technicians, cngincers and scientists, to support\nconstruction and operation, He pointed out that 40% of the current nuclear power plant workers are\neligible for retirement within the next five years.!?! Furthermore, he said only 8% of the current\nnuclear plant workforce is under 32 years old. While technical and engineering college graduate\nnumbers are increasing, Stall said that there is much competition from other industries for these\ngraduates and the nuclear industry must become creative if it is going to entice these graduates to\nenter and remain in the nuclear field.”\"?\n\nIn 1980, there were about 65 university nuclear engineering programs operating in the USA. In\n2008, there were only 31. The entire utility industry is hunting students at the university doors\nbefore they even graduate. “Westinghouse looks for qualified third and fourth year college students\nat career fairs, and by posting internship opportunities on the corporate website, in newspapers and\ntrade journals, and through various colleges and universities”, explains Steve Tritch, President and\nCEO of Westinghouse.'”? Starting from a virtual hiring freeze in the 1980s followed by a slow\nresumption by the end of the 1990s, the company jumpstarted the process in the period 2001-2005\nwith 400 new hires per year. The rate increased to 500 hires in 2006, a level that shall be\nmaintained over the coming years.

About 40% of the national utility EDF’s\ncurrent staff in reactor operation and maintenance is expected to retire by 2015. In its Reference\nReport 2008 EDF states that \"about half” of the operational and maintenance staff in production\nand engineering will retire between 2008 and 2015. EDF speaks clearly of an \"unbalanced age\nstructure\" since more than 65% of the workforce is over 40 (see Graph 13) and introduces the\nproblem of young skilled workers explicitly as risk factor:\nThe EDF group will do its utmost to recruit, retain, redeploy or renew these staff and\nskills in time and under satisfactory conditions. However, it cannot guarantee the\nmeasures adopted will always prove totally adequate, which may have an impact on its\nbusiness and financial results.'*7\nStarting in 2008, the utility has a hiring target of 500 engineers annually for the nuclear sector\nalone. In mid May 2009, EDF advertised for example open positions for 50 operator trainer\nengineers.\"* Where such a large number of experienced nuclear operators capable of training\nothers could possibly come from remains a mystery. Reactor builder AREVA tried to hire\n400 engineers in 2006 and another 750 in 2007. The level of success of the hiring efforts is not\nknown. AREVA, like other nuclear companies, has formed partnerships with certain universities\nand engineering schools and ‘shepherds’ students through their studies. AREVA’s strategic\nmarketing specialist Liz Smith explains that students can work effectively during studies and\nimmediately upon graduation. “The strong bonds they form with AREVA during their studies\nincrease loyalty to the company”.?

There are no official statistics on the overall number of graduates in\nnuclear science and technology in France but it is estimated at around 300. The CEA affiliated\nnational Institute for Nuclear Sciences and Techniques (INSTN), the most important nuclear\neducation institution in France, has produced fewer than 70 nuclear graduates per year. EDF first\ncalled upon INSTN to double the number of graduates over the coming years\" and then to\nmultiply the number by five to ten “as quickly as possible”. The head of nuclear studies at\nINSTN has indicated a more modest target of 150 graduates per year.” INSTN has been able to\nraise the number of graduates from a 30-year low of 41 in 2003 to a 30-year high of 108 in 2009\n{see Graph 13), about one third of the national nuclear graduate output, but far short of the\nestimated annual need of some 1,200 to 1,500 graduates.\nThe French nuclear industry has been very concerned for a number of years about the lack of\nmotivation of young students. While a number of initiatives have been taken to stimulate\ncoordination of recruiting and training of students, the most spectacular measure is undoubtedly the\nconstruction of the Flamanville-3 reactor. While the EPR “show case at home” was an important\npart of the decision, the investment was mainly motivated by the growing concern within the\nnuclear industry and the national operator to maintain key competences in the sector and thus\nsucceed in motivating young talent. It was feared that without a major “project” it would be\ndifficult to convince the young generation of an imminent revival and thus the guaranteed long-\nterm future of the nuclear industry (see also part IV).\n9 GIGA, “Liindustrie nucléaire francaise : perspectives, métiers / Le besoin d'EDF en 2008”, October 2007,\nhtlpyAvww giga-asso.com/fi/public/lindastrienucleaireftanc/emploisperspectives him!?PHPSESSID=2(7kmsonapeaTihklecmvdks45 .\ni\" Marie-Madeleine Séve, “Le plan d’EDF pour faire le plein d’ingénieurs”, Management, April 2008,\n12 Bruno Tarride, Letter to Bernard Bourret, dated 24 October 2008.\n\nGraph 14: Number of Nuclear Engineering Graduates from INSTN, France, 1956-2009\n460 Number of Nuclear Engineering Graduates at INSTN, France\n1956 - 2009 -\n90 |) Ss Oll*lkeooOOOEEEEumn—muaauauauauauoams]\n128 138\n420 =e\ni ~ f fos - 108|\nI nO) i 103°\n400 | rn 4 yg sO\nATTN il, | | |\n! !\nTANT (I |\n[ rs\n“a ALTVVTHVUAHTTTT\neT TT\n! 1 Wi ast\nWEEE HLT TTTEEELTATEAAEETTERCHEAT UTTER AGE\n2 UGUTUUT EU HHT TRTTTIT RI TTI TTR TET HEH\nHTEULIUMTEREETAVIETEEEULEELLEEEGUEEUUTLEIVEUUE\nAUC EUS\n1956: 1960 1965 1970 1975, 1980 1985 1990 1995 2000 2005 ;2009\"\nSource: CEA-INSTN, 2009\nThe French Nuclear Safety Authority (ASN) apparently is not encountering staffing problems\nand has considerably increased the number of employees from 312 in 2003 to 436 (+40%) at the\nend of 2008. Over the same time period the share of civil servants also increased from two thirds to\n78% of total staff.'“? The remaining employees are either made available by other institutions like\nthe CEA or work on a contractual basis. The civil servant status certainly shields ASN to some\nextent from attempts by utilities or industry to entice away staff.\nThe French Institute for Radiation Protection and Nuclear Safety (IRSN) that serves as\nTechnical Support Organisation (TSO) to ASN, reports an annual turnover of 3% to 6%. IRSN has\nhired between 52 and 79 (in 2008) engineer-level staff per year since 2004. IRSN human resources\ndirector Patricia de la Morlais explains that they hire every year “a few beginners, young\nprofessionals with three to five year experience and some experienced professionals”.'“* According\nto other sources, IRSN has lost 59 cxpericneed experts to the industry over the last few years.\nWhile de la Morlais did not explicitly confirm the figure, she stated that “it is not without interest\nfor [nuclear] safety that experienced experts from IRSN, within reasonable numbers, pursue their\ncareers within the industry or nuclear operators”.'** However, the mechanism raises concern in\nparticular in the case of smaller safety authorities and TSOs in other countries that cannot compete\nwith salary level and career perspectives in the nuclear industry and utility sector.\nIn the UK, as of 2002, there was not a single undergraduate course in nuclear engineering left. A\nstudy of Nuclear and Radiological Skills by the Department of Trade and Industry reported the\nsame year that the power, fuel, defense and clean-up sub-sectors of the nuclear industry would\nrequire approximately 1,000 graduates a year until 2017. Of these, about 700 would be\nreplacements for retirements and 300 in response to the growth in nuclear clean-up. Six years later,\nthe head of the Nuclear Installations Inspectorate confirmed in oral evidence that he was struggling\nto recruit sufficient inspectors. He stated in July 2008 that he had 153 full-time equivalent\ninspectors and was expecting to recruit about 20 more people. He added: “For existing predictive\nbusiness excluding new build I need 192”. A 2009 UK House of Commons nuclear skills\nassessment “found plenty of evidence to suggest that there are very real skills shortages in the\n‘8 Emmanuel Bouchot, personal communication, e-mail, dated 29 April 2009,\n14 Patricia de la Morlais, personal communication, c-mail, dated 4 May 2009.\n\"5 Ibidem.\n6 Tbidem.\n\nnuclear industry”. 4” As in other countries, the nuclear industry will have to compete with other\neconomic sectors. Forty percent of National Grid’s workforce will reach retirement age over the\nnext 10-15 years. The UK, the House of Commons learned, faces a “crucial skills shortage from\n2015 to 2025 that will make power supplies less reliable and more expensive”.'*\nThe National Skills Academy for Nuclear estimated in February 2009 that the UK nuctear industry\nneeds to recruit between 590 to 970 graduates and 270 to 450 skilled trades personnel annually\nover the next ten years. For Philip Thomas, Chairman of the Nuclear Academia-Industry Liaison\nSociety (NAILS), “the risk is not so much that the nuclear companies will be unable to recruit\nsufficient numbers, but that future recruits will not match the very high quality the nuclear industry\nhas been used to” and “the absence of a market for a BEng/MEng in nuclear engineering serves to\nconfirm that nuclear energy carries no buzz of excitement for new students, making it all the harder\nfor it to attract the brightest and best!\nIn Germany the nuclear competence situation is dramatic. A 2004 analysis of the nuclear\neducation and workforce development in the country showed that the situation continues to erode\nrapidly. Employment is expected to decline in the nuclear sector - including in the reactor building\nand maintenance industry - by about 10% to 6,250 jobs in 2010. These still include 1,670 hires,\nwhile the number of academic institutions teaching nuclear related matters is expected to further\ndecline from 22 in 2000 to 10 in 2005 and only five in 2010.'°° While 46 students obtained their\nnuclear diplomas in 1993, there were zero graduates in 1998. In fact, between the end of 1997 and\nthe end of 2002, only two students successfully graduated in a nuclear major (see Graph 14). In\ntotal about 50 students from other majors continued to attend lectures in nuclear matters. It is clear\nthat Germany will face a dramatic shortage of trained staff, whether in industry, utilities, research\nor public safety and radiation protection authorities.'*!\nIn order to combat the obvious nuclear competence bottlencck in Germany, in March 2000 the\nAlliance for Competence in Nuclear Technology (Kompetenzverbund Kerntechnik) that pulls\ntogether nuclear research centres, universities, TSOs and federal ministries was established. The\nAlliance has not updated figures on its website since 2004 and refuses to communicate any more\nrecent figures on the development of nuclear education in Germany.'** However, according to a\nrecent report in Nature, in February 2009 AREVA established a “Nuclear Professional School\" at\nthe Karlsruhe Institute of Technology (KIT) providing post-graduate training in various nuclear\nspecialties. According to Nature, “the 30 PhD students enrolled at the school at any one time are\npaid by AREVA and have guarantees that they will be employed when their training is\ncompleted.\"\nAs Lothar Hahn, managing director of the German TSO GRS (Society for Reactor Safety), points\nout, the consequences could be serious:\nFirst studies indicate that deficiencies in maintaining knowledge at state-of-the-art\nlevels and a subsequent degradation in education and training of operating personnel\nmay endanger the safe operation of nuclear installations.

The number of nuclear graduates and technicians\nis insufficient and many graduates do not enter or quickly leave the nuclear sector.

Economic Analysis\n\nf.1. Introduction\n\nWhen Lewis Strauss spoke in 1954 of power ‘too cheap to meter’*, it was a phrase that was\nquickly embedded in the psyche of the public. Today, despite ample evidence to the contrary, many\npeople still assume nuclear power is cheap and that the barriers to its take-up are largely those of\npublic opinion and opposition. The assumption of low cost is one that electric utilities that own\nnuclear power plants, however expensive, are generally happy to go along with and promote — if\nonly to prevent having to acknowledge that they made bad investment decisions in the past.\n\nThere were early hints that nuclear was actually quite expensive. These came through large cost\noverruns and project cancellations even in a regulated utility environment. However, it is only\nrecently that nuclear economics have begun to face the market test. Thus far, this test has come\nmostly through financial decisions to build non-nuclear assets. The first reactor order in an\nostensibly fully liberalized electricity market did not occur until December 2003 with the signing of\nconstruction contracts for the Olkiluoto reactor in Finland. However, as shown in section III.3.1.1,\nfar from competing in the liberalized market, the terms of the deal deliberately avoid exposure to\nthe competitive market. With regulated markets, electric utilities were monopolies with much\ngreater (though not unlimited) flexibility to pass along whatever costs they incurred to consumers.\nMany other costs were effectively borne by the taxpayer. This allowed a complacency in regard to\nplant economics that is supposed to no longer exist in a deregulated market. Investors now bear a\nmuch higher likelihood of having to absorb the losses should their initial market or cost\nassumptions turn out to be wrong.\n\nEvidence began to emerge from the late 1970s onwards that nuclear power was not the cheap\noption it was portrayed to be. In the USA, the economic regulatory system required extensive\ndisclosure of costs by utilities, and limited their ability to recover those costs from ratepayers. Only\nfunds that regulators agreed had been spent well (assets that were ‘used and useful’ and costs\n‘prudently incurred’) were eligible for cost recovery. By the late 1970s, nuclear power plants were\ncoming on line not only late but often at several times their estimated cost. When this happened,\nthe over-budget reactors caused huge increases in electricity tariffs (so-called ‘rate shock’) within\nthe regions they served. Regulators became increasingly unwilling to allow the utilities to recover\nthese excessive costs. Often, they forced at least a portion of the cost overruns to be paid not by\nratepayers, but out of the regulated profit margins of the utility. This shift quickly brought nuclear\nordering to a halt and led to more than 100 cancellations of plants at various stages in the\nconstruction process.'*” Bankers were simply unwilling to lend money to utilities because of the\nrisk of default. Utilities were prepared to make deals with regulators that allowed them to recover\nat least some of the cost of these abandoned plants provided they did not proceed with them. This is\nan important contrast with deregulated markets as well, since abandoned capital infrastructure\nprojects bring in no revenues at all to the investor.\n\nFurther evidence of the poor economics of nuclear came with the attempt to privatize Britain’s\nnuclear power plants in 1987-90. The costs associated with these plants were determined more\nrigorously by the private sector and investors made it clear they would be unwilling to buy the\nnuclear assets, partly because the operating costs alone were about double the expected market\nprice for electricity. Interest was also low because the company that bought the existing plants\nwould have been expected to build four new nuclear plants as well - a risk the new owners were\nunwilling to take. The lack of buyers led the UK. government to retain these plants within the public\nsector. Over the next six years, plant capacity factors and market conditions improved enough to\nbring at least operating costs below revenues. As a result, the most moder of these plants were\nprivatized in 1996, though at a price constituting a small fraction of the funds invested to date.\n\n© Lewis L. Strauss, Speech to the National Association of Science Writers, New York City, 16 September\n1954.\n\n157 All orders after 1973 were subsequently cancelled. Over the years, in total 138 unit orders have been\ncancelled in the USA.\n\nAt about the same time, a few US nuclear plants were closed at the instigation of the economic\nregulators because they believed it would be cheaper to build and operate new gas-fired plants than\nto continue to just operate the nuclear plants.\n\nThis evidence of high construction costs and high operating costs was often seen as a characteristic\nof the US and UK markets rather than as a basic feature of the nuclear fuel chain. The basis for this\nview was that these countries had done a poor job with their civil nuclear power programs; and that\nthe UK relied on Advanced Gas-cooled Reactors (AGRs), a technology not used elsewhere in the\nworld. However, as electricity markets began to be liberalized and the assumption that utilities\ncould pass any costs they incurred on to consumers no longer applied, nuclear orders dried up in\nother countries as well. The cost of both debt and equity capital rose to reflect the risk inherent in\nthe projects — a risk investors believed to be quite high. The result was very few reactor starts\nanywhere in the world for a period of decades.\n\nIn the past decade, however, there has been renewed interest in nuclear power plants, labeled by\nsome the ‘nuclear renaissance’. Three main factors are driving this trend. First, a new generation of\nnuclear power plant designs, so-called Generation III+ designs, are claimed to be more reliable and\nless expensive; second, there is a perceived need to increase generation from low-carbon sources to\ncombat climate change; and third, in the absence of efficient use of electricity, there is also a need\nto replace a large number of base-load power plants in North America and Western Europe as they\nare retired.\n\nThe remainder of this section explores a number of central issues relating to nuclear economics\nincluding sharply rising build costs and sensitivity to capital costs. These factors provide important\ninsights on how effectively new nuclear power plant construction will meet the industry-stated\nobjectives of providing cost-effective energy security and climate change mitigation.\n\nll.1.1. Problems of estimating and comparing nuclear costs\n\nConstruction costs for nuclear power plants have remained a central problem with the technology.\nWhile the costs to build non-nuclear power plants have generally declined a little in real terms from\nthe mid-70s until about five years ago,'** real nuclear construction costs have increased consistently\nthroughout the 50-year commercial history of nuclear power. Accurately estimating the\nconstruction cost is a challenging task, as over the past couple of decades there have been few\nreactor orders for which reliable cost estimates have been published. Nonetheless, the information\nthat is available illustrates that estimated costs have increased dramatically in the past decade.\nOther fuel chain costs, such as nuclear waste disposal and plant decommissioning, have risen even\nmore rapidly than the costs of the plants themselves in the past two decades. Operating costs\nremain low relative to other forms of electric power, though they are expected to rise significantly\nshould many additional reactors be built. Operating costs are also sensitive to the question of how\nmuch of the risk associated with possible accidents and with nuclear waste management is shifted\nto the public sector, rather than borne by plant owners, and through power charges, by the plant's\ncustomers.\n\nOne clear lesson from the history of nuclear power is that estimated costs are invariably less than\nactual costs incurred during plant construction. In addition, ‘generic’ estimates, such as those\nregularly provided by industry trade associations, are always lower than estimates provided by\ncompanies that are involved in real projects such as vendors or utilities. Finally, comparisons of\nreactors costs across the world are not always normalized properly, sometimes resulting in\ninaccurate trend comparisons.\n\nComparing a relatively small number of discrete plants across many countries and decades requires\ncareful adjustments to take account of shifts (sometimes quite large ones) in inflation and exchange\nrates, For example, if the annual rate of inflation was 3%, over a decade, nominal prices would\nhave increased by 34% simply because of inflation. The value of the dollar fell from November\n158 Energy Information Administration, “Impacts of Rising Construction and Equipment Costs on Energy\nIndustries”, Issues in Focus AEOQ2007; http:/Avww.eia.doe.gov/oiat/aeo/otheranalysis/cecet.html, accessed\n\n31 March 2009.\n\n2005 when €1 was worth US$1.17 to July 2008, when €1 was worth US$1.57. By November 2008\nthe value of the dollar had increased sharply so that €1 was worth US$1.27 yet by December 2008,\nit had fallen again to US$1.40. The shifts meant that a plant that cost US$1000/kW in November\n2005 would then have cost €855/kW whereas in July 2008, the same cost would have been\nequivalent to €637/kW.\n\nAnother big challenge is ensuring that the data presented are really counting the same portion of the\nmany steps needed to bring a new plant into operation. An “overnight” cost approach is frequently\nused to compare prices on an equal basis across projects. The metric includes the first fuel charge\nbut does not include financing charges (which would vary according to the circumstances of the\nproject). In determining the cost per kW, it should be the ‘net’ rating (Le., net of energy used in the\nplant itself) of the plant that is used. Note, however, that because the financing costs associated.\nwith nuclear are higher than for other energy resources (both because the plants are deemed higher\nrisk, and often take longer to build), overnight cost comparisons across energy options by definition\nwill overstate the viability of nuclear projects.\n\nTechnology risk is another factor that makes comparison of plant costs more difficult. The industry\noften refers to these as ‘first of a kind’ (FOAK costs). FOAK costs apply to some extent to all\ntechnologies but because lot sizes for nuclear plants are much smaller than, for example, for\nairplanes, these initial costs become a much more important factor in the overall economics of a\nparticular design, FOAK costs are sometimes included in cost estimates, while at other times the\nnumbers presented for plants exclude these costs. The industry may have incentives to use FOAK\nfactors to ‘game’ reported costs. For example, in December 2008, EDF claimed that the cost of a\nfirst of a kind plant might be double that of a ‘series’ unit (one of at least 10 units of the same\ndesign).'*? How far this estimate was meant as an excuse for the high cost of Flamanville-3 is not\nelcar. However, it is likely to be an over-cstimate. In most cases, development costs are recovered\nover several units, not just one. Another problem with the FOAK argument is that sales of more\nthan 10 of a given reactor design are quite rare. For example, although EDF built 34 PWRs of the\n900 MW design, they were actually made up of four separate sub-models. The 20 units of the\n1300 MW series were of two sub-models and only four units were ever built of the 1450 model.\nThere are also location specific factors, such as whether the plant uses sea-cooling or cooling\ntowers (more expensive), what geological and seismic issues there are and what new transmission\nfacilities are required. Where more than one reactor is built on a site, there is likely to be the\npossibility of sharing some costs and this will reduce the cost per unit.\n\nThe influential Keystone report! suggested that in today’s market environment, later orders of a\nparticular design may turn out to be more expensive because factors such as shortages of skills and.\nmanufacturing capacity force prices up.\n\nAll these factors mean that care should be taken in attaching any significance to price differences of\nless than, say, 20%, unless it is clear that all these factors have been taken account of.\n\n11.1.2. Generation IIl+ plants\n\nThe nuclear industry has categorized reactor designs into four generations, with the first generation\nthe prototypes and early commercial designs, and the second the majority of plants ordered from\nthe mid 1960s onwards. The third generation represents designs made available from about 1980\nonwards, while a fourth generation is not expected to be commercially available for 20 years or\nmore, Within Generation III, there is now a Generation HII+, which has become available since\nabout 2000, and the Generation [I+ designs are the ones on which the hopes for the ‘nuclear\nrenaissance’ are based. There are no hard and fast definitions about what criteria should be used to\ndefine what category a particular design falls into. However, Generation IIl+ is said to be\ndistinguished from Generation III by the greater use of ‘passive safety’ systems — where\n189 Nucleonics Week, “EDF: Flamanville-3 cost rise due to inflation, technical/regulatory changes”,\n\n11 December 2008, p 1.\n\n16 The Keystone Center, \"Nuclear Power Joint Fact-Finding\", Keystone Center, Keystone, 2007;\nhttp:/Avww.ne.doe.gov/pdfpdfFi/rpt_KeystoneReportNKeystoneReportNuclearPowKey_2007.pdf , accessed\non 3 April 2009.\n\noperational safety in the plant relies more on inherent laws of physics rather than on active\nengineered systems, such as emergency core cooling systems.\n\nFive designs are being reviewed by the US safety authorities, the Nuclear Regulatory Commission\n(NRC). Which of these should be regarded as Generation III and which are III+ is not clear. The\nfive designs under scrutiny by the NRC are:\n\n¢ European Pressurized water Reactor (EPR)'*!. EPR is supplied by Areva NP’. This design\nhas been ordered for Finland (Olkiluoto-3), France (Flamanville-3) and China (Taishan),\nalthough the first unit is not expected to be completed before 2012. It is being evaluated in\nthe USA by the NRC and in the UK by the Nuclear Installations Inspectorate (NID)'™,\nalthough neither body is likely to complete its review before mid-2011. The outcome\nremains uncertain.\n\n¢ Advanced Passive 1000 (AP-1000). This design is offered by Westinghouse (now owned.\nby Toshiba) and has been ordered for China (Sanmen and Yangijiang), although\nconstruction only started in December 2008 and in April 2009 respectively. It has been\napproved by the NRC although some detailed issues are not expected to be resolved before\n2010. The issues concern protection against impact by aircraft.’ It is being reviewed with\na view to licensing by the NII in the UK, but this process will probably not be complete\nbefore 2012.\n\n+ Advanced Boiling Water Reactor (ABWR). Four units are in operation in Japan, one more\nis under construction there and two are under construction in Taiwan. It is being offered in\nthe USA by GE-Hitachi and, independently, by Toshiba. It was first ordered in 1989 and\ngiven regulatory approval by the US NRC in 1997. That certification was for 15 years and\nGE-Hitachi notified the NRC in December 2008 that it intends to apply for a renewal of the\ncertification in mid-2010.' Toshiba has to replace some elements of the design that are\nspecific to GE-Hitachi and will also have to renew NRC certification.\n\n* The ESBWR (Economic Simplified Boiling Water Reactor) is a Boiling Water Reactor\n(BWR) generating about 1550 MW supplied by a US-Japanese consortium, GE-Hitachi,\nformed in January 2007. No orders have yet been placed and the design is not expected to\ncomplete scrutiny by the US NRC until 2010. It was also being considered by the UK\nregulatory authorities, but in 2008, GE-Hitachi withdrew it from the procedures. Of the\n28 units for which applications for construction licenses have been submitted to the US\nregulator, six were based on the ESBWR design. However, the utility proposing two of\nthese (Exelon’s Victoria site) said in November 2008 that it was looking for a more proven\ndesign. In February 2009, the utility proposing two more of the units asked the NRC to\nsuspend consideration of its application (see below for more details). Given these problems\nin the UK and USA, the prospects for this design look poor. It may be that the more\nproven, but less advanced ABWR will replace the ESBWR in the USA.\n\n¢ The APWR (Advanced Pressurized Water Reactor) is a 1700 MW PWR to be supplied by\nMitsubishi. First orders for this design are expected in Japan within the next couple of\nyears but these orders have long been delayed. Regulatory approval in the USA is not\nexpected before 2012. Of the 28 units for which applications for construction licenses have\nbeen submitted to the US regulator, only two at the Comanche Peak site are based on the\nAPWR design. The Comanche Peak plants were amongst five sites shortlisted in February\n\n1!

However,\nwhile the Russian designs may be important in markets such as Russia, China and India, they are\nnot under active scrutiny for licensing by Western safety regulatory authorities so they are not\nconsidered further. Other designs under development are: AECL’s (Canada) ACR-1000, which is a\n1000 MW pressurized light- water cooled, heavy-water moderated reactor; and AREVA NP’s\n‘Kerena’ design (previously known as SWR-1000) which is a boiling water reactor (BWR)\ndeveloped from Siemens’ BWR design built at Gundremmingen.\nH1.2. The Determinants of Nuclear Economics\nIt has long been known that ‘fixed’ costs — those that are incurred whether or not the plant is\noperated — would dominate the overall cost of electricity (per kWh) from a nuclear power plant.\nThe ‘rule of thumb’ was generally that fixed costs made up at least two thirds of the total cost per\nkWh. The fixed costs themselves comprised mainly costs associated with construction and\ndecommissioning but were dominated by the former. There are three elements to the fixed cost per\nkWh: the cost of construction; the power produced for sale; and the cost of capital. In the past,\ndebates on nuclear economics have been dominated by estimates of construction costs. However,\nthe much poorer than expected reliability of nuclear plants in some countries as well as the\nincreasing focus on the economic risk of building a nuclear power plant, indicate the other two\nfactors deserve comparable attention.\nOther significant elements in the economics of nuclear power are the operating cost, including the\ncost of fuel and the expected lifetime.\nGovernment plays a vital role in making nuclear orders viable by guaranteeing, explicitly or\nimplicitly, some costs. It explicitly provides guarantees by limiting the liability of operators in the\nevent of an accident to sums that are trivial in comparison with the possible actual costs.'®’ This has\nbeen done through a mixture of intemational treaties (Brussels and Vienna) and national\nagreements. In general national limits are in the order of a few hundred million Euro, less than 10%\nof the cost of building a plant and far less than the cost of the Chernobyl accident.\nGovernmenis implicitly guarantee the long-term liabilities against the failure of the companies. For\nexample, if a company owning a nuclear power plant fails, taxpayers will inevitably have to pick\nup the bill for any decommissioning and waste disposal for which provisions do not exist. This has\nhappened already in the UK where arrangements for funding decommissioning of civil nuclear\nfacilities have almost entirely failed. The UK failure has effectively shifted a liability of about\n€90bn from beneficiaries of nuclear power onto future taxpayers.!* Governments may also fix the\nprice of waste disposal. In the USA, utilities pay the government a fixed fee of US$1/MWh for\ndisposal of spent fuel, while in the UK, the government has proposed that the price utilities pay for\nwaste disposal for any new plants be fixed on the day construction starts.’\n186 Reuters, “DOE drops Luminant Texas from nuclear loan talks” 8 May 2009.\nhttp://uk.reuters.com/article/governmentFilingsNews/idUKNO0741783620090507?utm_source=newsletter&ut\nm_medium=email&utm_campaign=sendNuclearHeadlines&pageNumber=] &virtualBrandChannel=0 ,\naccessed on 9 May 2009,\n167 Stephen Thomas, Peter Bradford, Antony Froggatt & David Milborrow, “The economics of nuclear\npower’, Amsterdam, Greenpeace International”, 2007.\n168 Stephen Thomas, “Nuclear Power in Britain since Chemobyl: A Rollercoaster Ride”, in Lutz Mez, Mycle\nSchneider & Steve Thomas (eds) (2009) “International Perspectives on Energy Policy and the Role of\nNuclear Power”, Multi-Science Publishing, Brentwood.\n1© Department for Business, Enterprise and Regulatory Reform, Press release, “Clean up fund is precondition\nfor new nuclear — Hutton”, 22 February 2008; http://www.nce.co.uk/clean-up-fund-is-precondition-for-new-\nnuclear-huttor/766426.article .\n\n11.3. Fixed Costs\n\nlIL.3.1. Construction costs\n\nAs noted above, nuclear construction costs are hard to estimate, but have been rising sharply in the\nsituations in which plants have progressed. When the Generation III+ designs were first being\ndiscussed, the nuclear industry argued strongly that these could be built for an overnight cost of\nUS$1000/kW so that a plant of 1000 MW (1 million kW) would cost US$1bn. For example, even.\nas late as 2003, a senior vice president of Westinghouse, Regis Matzie was claiming construction\ncosts would be US$1000-1200/kW'”. The designers of the EPR were more cautious in their\nestimates but still claimed about US$1400 was achievable.!”\n\nIn 2002-04, a scries of nuclear power economics studies was published!” with somewhat higher\nprices but these were still generally below US$2000/kW and sometimes below US$1000/kW. The\nfirst cost estimate for a real plant was the contract price for the Olkiluoto-3 reactor in Finland.\nTI1.3.1.1. European experience\n\nOlkiluoto, Finland\n\nThe Olkiluoto-3 order for Finland was seen as particularly important for the nuclear industry\nbecause it seemed to contradict the conventional wisdom that liberalization and nuclear power\norders were incompatible. Placed in December 2003, the Olkiluoto-3 reactor was the first nuclear\norder in Western Europe and North America since the Civaux-2 order in France in 1993, and the\nfirst order outside the Pacific Rim for a Generation III/II+ design. The Finnish electricity industry\nhad been attempting to obtain Parliamentary approval for a fifth nuclear unit in Finland since 1992.\nThis was finally granted in 2002. The Olkiluoto-3 order, when it was placed in December 2003,\nwas a huge boost for the nuclear industry in general and the vendor, AREVA NP, in particular.\nIndustry anticipated that, once complete, the plant would provide a demonstration and reference for\nother prospective buyers of the EPR.\n\nFinland is part of the Nordic electricity market covering Norway, Sweden, and Denmark as well.\nThe region is generally seen as the most competitive electricity market in the world. Finland also\nhas a good reputation for the operation of the four units located in the country. So there were high\nhopes that this would answer many of the questions concerning the ‘nuclear renaissance.’\nHowever, closer examination of the deal, elaborated in the following sections, reveals some very\nspecial features that raise questions as to how representative this deal is of conditions in other\nmarkets.\n\nThe contract price for Olkiluoto-3 was reported in 2004 to be €3bn for a 1600 MW plant.'”\nSubsequently the price was reported to be €3.2bn!”* or €3.3bn.!” Safety approval was given by the\nFinnish regulator, STUK, in March 2005 and substantive work on-site started in August 2005. At\nthe time the contract was signed, the value was equivalent to about US$3.6-4.0bn (depending on\nthe contract price) or about $2250-2475/kW (€1=US$1.2). This cost included finance and two\nreactor cores and so the cost per kW in overnight terms would have been somewhat lower,\nalthough given, as we can see below, the very low rate of interest charged (2.6%), finance costs\nwould be low.\n\n1° Regis Matzie, “The AP1000 Reactor: Nuclear Renaissance Option”, Presentation to Tulane Engineering\nForum, 26 September 2003; http:/Awww,sse.tulane.edu/FORUM_2003/Matzie%20Presentation.pdf. accessed\non 31 March 2009,\n\n™ Nucleonics Week, “Giant EPR said to be competitive: EDF to decide on order next year”, 6 November\n1998, p 1.\n\n172 See review of various studies in Stephen Thomas, Peter Bradford, Antony Froggatt & David Milborrow,\n“The cconomics of nuclear power”, Amsterdam, Greenpeace International, 2007.\n\n™ Project Director Martin Landtman stated: “The value of the whole Olkiluoto 3 investment including the\nTurn-key Contract is about EUR 3 billion in year 2003 money.

As\nan additional incentive and at the request of the customer, AREVA NP offered the plant on\n‘turnkey’ terms, that is, fixed price. It also took responsibility for the management of the site and.\nfor the architect engineering, not just the supply of the ‘nuclear island’. This was not a role it was\naccustomed to. In the 58 PWRs AREVA NP’s predecessor, Framatome, had supplied for France, as\nwell as for the foreign projects including those in China and South-Africa, it was EDF that had\nprovided these services.\n\nAs has been documented elsewhere'”, the Olkiluoto project has gone seriously wrong since\nconstruction started. By March 2009\" the project was acknowledged to be at least three years late\nand €1.7bn over budget. It is now expected to cost about US$4000/kW.'\"! The contract is also the\nsubject of an acrimonious dispute between AREVA NP and the customer, Teollisuuden Voima Oy\n{TVO). AREVA NP claims compensation of about €1bn for alleged failures of TVO. TVO, in a\nJanuary 2009 counterclaim, is demanding €2.4bn in compensation from AREVA NP for delays in\nthe project,”\n\nIt seems unlikely that all the problems that have contributed to the delays and cost-overruns have\nbeen solved; the final cost could be significantly higher. The result of the claim and counter-claim\narbitration between AREVA NP and TVO will determine how the cost over-tun will be\napportioned. Regardless, however, it is clear that investor concerns on plant costs and delivery\nremain valid.\n\nFlamanville, France\n\nEDF finally ordered an EPR reactor in January 2007, to be located at their Flamanville site. This\nreactor was uprated to 1630 MW\" and construction commenced in December 2007\". In May\n2006, EDF estimated the cost would be €3.3bn.'** At that time (€1=US$1.28), this was equivalent\nto US$2590/kKW. This cost however did not include the first fuel, so the overnight cost would have\nbeen somewhat higher. The cost estimate did not include finance either.\n\nEDF did not seek a turnkey contract and chose to manage the contracting, letting contracts, for\nexample, for the turbine generator, and also the architect engineering. How far these decisions were\ninfluenced by the poor experience at Olkiluoto and how far they were influenced by the need it saw\nto maintain in-house skills is not clear.

Delays had led the\nvendor, AREVA NP to forecast the plant would not be completed until 2013, a year late, but in\nNovember 2008, EDF claimed the delays could be made up and the plant finished to the original\nschedule of 2012.'** EDF did acknowledge that the expected construction costs for Flamanville had\nincreased from €3.3 billion to €4 billion!” This was then equivalent (€1=US$1.33) to\nUS$3,265/kW, substantially more than the Olkiluoto contract price, but far below the levels being\nquoted in the USA and the actual cost of Olkiluoto. An AREVA official has suggested that the cost\nof an EPR will now be at least €4.5bn, although it was not specified whether this was an overnight\ncost.\n\nComparison of Olkiluote and Flamanville\n\nComparisons between Olkiluoto and Flamanville need to be made with care. Currency movements\nmay have a significant impact if the cost is translated to dollars, and in the three years gap between\nthe orders, inflation might have increased prices by about 10%. There is also the difference in\nscope of the contract in respect of fuel and finance costs. The rating of both plants is likely to be\naround 1700 MW when the plant is commissioned so the small difference in cost because the rating\nof the Flamanville plant is 2% higher than that of Olkiluoto is not significant, EDF’s cost estimates\nalso tend to be regarded with some suspicion as being underestimates of the true cost. This is partly\nbecause of their aspirations in the international market to offer nuclear construction services — they\nclearly would want to portray themselves as being very efficient and low-cost. More innocently, in\nsuch a large organization costs that should rightly be attributed to a specific project may be lost\nunder more gencral headings. This process was clearly illustrated in the UK prior to privatization.\nThe Central Electricity Generating Board (CEGB) published estimates of the cost of nuclear power\nthat showed it to be competitive, at least on a marginal cost base.'*! However, when the costs were\nrigorously split, it was found that the marginal cost was double the market price of electricity. This\nwas reported to have been as much of a shock to the staff of the CEGB as to the public.\n\nOverall, given the rapid increase in nuclear construction cost estimates in the period between the\nOlkiluoto and Flamanville orders, discussed below under North America, the relatively small\ndifference between the contract prices for Olkiluoto and Flamanville is surprising. However, in\nboth cases, the contract price is likely to have little in common with the actual price. It would not\nbe surprising if the total cost of the Olkiluoto plant was significantly more than the latest estimate\nof 50% over-budget, while the Flamanville plant has also already increased in cost from the\noriginal estimate.\n\nFor future EPRs, AREVA estimated in September 2008 that the overnight cost would be €4.5bn\n(US$6.5bn at September 2008 exchange rate of €1=US$1.43). At the new rating of the EPR,\n1700 MW, this works out at US$3800/kW'™. B.ON estimated in May 2008 that an EPR built in the\nUK would cost €5 to 6bn. Whether this is an overnight cost or includes finance is not clear.'%3\n\n186 European Daily Electricity Markets, “EDF's past efforts pay off with two EPR deals sealed in China”,\n\n15 August 2008.\n\n187 Nucleonics Week, “Conercte pouring at Flamanville-3 stopped after new problems found”, 29 May 2008,\np 1s.\n\n'8§ Nucleonics Week, “EDF confirms target of starting up Flamanville-3 in 2012”, 20 November 2008, p 1.\n189 Associated Press Worldstream, “EDF to lead up to euro50B in nuctear plant investment”, 4 December\n2008.\n\n199 Nucleonics Week, “AREVA official says costs for new EPR rising, exceeding $6.5 billion”, 4 September 2008,\np.l.\n\n181 Gordon MacKerron, “Nuclear Power under review”, in John Surrey, “The British Electricity Experiment”,\nEarthscan, London 1997,\n\n1 Nucleonics Weck, “AREVA official says costs for new EPR rising, exceeding $6.5 billion”, 4 September\n2008, p 1.\n\n198 The Times, “Reactors will cost twice estimate, says E.ON chief”, 5 May 2008, p 32.\n\nIII.3.1.2. US estimates\nWhile there is little experience of construction of Generation II/IIE plants in Europe, there is no\nexperience at all in the USA. At present, it seems unlikely that construction will start on any plants\nin less than three years. Nevertheless, there is a high level of interest in the Nuclear 2010 program\nlaunched by the last administration. More than a dozen utilities have announced their possible\ninterest in building nuclear power plants; this has generated a large number of cost estimates from\nsources that have a real interest in building nuclear plants.\nWhile there have been many studies of nuclear plant costs conducted by a variety of parties in the\nUSA, we focus on a handful of assessments that were conducted in a systematic and detailed\nmanner by well-respected institutions. These studies help illustrate the variability in cost values, as\nwell as trend lines.\nMIT 2003194\nA study based at MIT was published in 2003. It was written primarily by an interdisciplinary group\nof professors mainly from MIT, but included an advisory committee of distinguished members\ndrawn from the full range of interests from environmental groups to nuclear power associations.\nFor its base case, the study assumed an overnight cost of US$2000/kW. For its low case it assumed\n(p41) “that construction costs can be reduced by 25% from the base case levels to more closely\nmatch optimistic but plausible forecasts”. These figures were not based on the most recent US\ncosts, which were regarded as untypical, but on industry estimates and from experience of recent\nforeign Generation III plants, from Japan and South Korea, Whether this foreign data is reliable is\nfar from clear. In retrospect, the estimates seem very low, compared even to the Olkiluoto-3\ncontract price of later the same year as the study. However, the industry was still aggressively\nprojecting low construction costs. In an Appendix (p. 138), MIT presented cost estimates from\nvendors most of which, for an ‘nth’ of a kind order (i.c., an order without FOAK costs), were for\nless than US$1250/kW. Despite the low assumed construction costs, the study concluded (p. IX):\nIn deregulated markets, nuclear power is not now cost competitive with coal and\nnatural gas. However, plausible reductions by industry in capital cost, operation and.\nmaintenance costs, and construction time could reduce the gap. Carbon emission\ncredits, if enacted by government, can give nuclear power a cost advantage.'®*\nKeystone Center 200719°\nThe Keystone study “Nuclear Power Joint Fact-Finding” (NJFF) was, as the name implies, an\nattempt to gain a consensus from a wide range of experts from diverse interests, a number of whom\nhad advised the MIT study. It assumed an overnight cost of US$2950 for both its low and high\ncases but generated a higher total capital cost for its high case by assuming a shorter plant life, a\nhigher cost of capital, more rapid depreciation, a longer construction period of six years rather than\nfive years and real cost escalation over the construction period of 3.3%. In the low case, this gave a\ntotal construction cost, including finance of US$3600/kW and in the high case, US$4000/KW, an\n11% difference.\nThe basic figure of USS2950/kW was obtained, as with the MIT study, from the reported cost of\nGeneration III plants completed in Japan and South Korea between 1994 and 2005. The study did\nnot make firm conclusions on the competitiveness of nuclear but did find (p. 11):\nWe found that a reasonable range for the expected levelized cost of nuclear power is\nbetween 8 and 11 cents per kilowatt-hour (kWh) delivered to the grid.\n194 Massachusetts Institute of Technology, \"The future of nuclear power\" MIT, Boston. 2003.\nhttp://Aweb.mit.cdu/nuclearpower/ accessed on 3 April 2009.\n185 Tt should be noted that the MIT study did not compare nuclear power with anything except coal or gas\nfired central plants,\n1% The Keystone Center, \"Nuclear Power Joint Fact-Finding\", Keystone Center, Keystone, 2007;\nhttp:/Avww.ne.doe.gov/pdfpdfFi/rpt_KeystoneReportNKeystoneReportNuclearPowKey_2007.pdf , accessed\non 3 April 2009. The eleven sponsors of the study include seven nuclear utilities and one nuclear builder.\n\nHowever, its findings on how far nuclear power could contribute to combating global warming\nwere interesting. It stated (p. 11):\nThe NIFF participants agree that to build enough nuclear capacity to achieve the\ncarbon reductions of a Pacala/Socolow wedge (1 GtC/year or 700 net GWe nuclear\npower; 1,070 total GWe) would require the industry to return immediately to the most\nrapid period of growth experienced in the past (1981-90) and sustain this rate of\ngrowth for 50 years,!\"”\nPacala/Socolow argued that at least seven ‘wedges’ would be needed to stabilize global\natmospheric CO, concentrations.'*\nMIT 2009 Update\nIn May 2009, MIT published an update to the 2003 study.'®? However, the team that produced the\nreport was very different from the 2003 team with much weaker economics and policy credentials.\nThis bias is reflected in the report. While the report makes significant changes to the economic\nassumptions, for example doubling the estimated construction cost to $4000/KW, this deterioration\nin the economics is not mentioned in the summary or the conclusions. Even more remarkably, the\nreport still asserts (p. 8):\nThe 2003 report found that capital cost reductions and construction time reductions\nwere plausible, but not yct proven — this judgment is unchanged today.\nThe economic analysis is not even contained in the main report, but was published separately.”\nThe conclusions betray the prejudices of the authors:\nThe sober warning is that if more is not done, nuclear power will diminish as a\npractical and timely option for deployment at a scale that would constitute a material\ncontribution to climate change risk mitigation.\nWhile the 2003 report had serious faults, it was a significant and carefully argued piece of work.\nThe update is much more a statement of beliefs by the authors, often in contradiction to the analysis\nthey present.\nStandard & Poor’s and Moody’s\nAs credit rating agencies, the research capabilities of these two agencies have to be strong,\nalthough the financial crisis has damaged their credibility somewhat. In October 2007, Moody’s\nestimated overnight construction costs for a nuclear plant at US$5000-6000/kW.™ In its report of\nOctober 2008, Standard & Poor’s accepted the figure from a study by the Federal Energy\nRegulatory Commission (FERC) that — after including interest during construction (allowance for\nfunds used during construction in the case of regulated utilities in some states), and other\nescalation/inflation factors — can range from around $5,000 per kW to $8,000 per kw.\n197 The Keystone Center, op cit, p. 21. “Pacala/Socolow presented 15 possible technology wedges, not all\ncompletely independent of cach other, and argued that at least seven of these wedges, or a larger number of\npartial wedges, would be necessary to stabilize global atmospheric CO, concentrations”.\n\"8 Steve Pacala & Rob Socolow, “Stabilization Wedges: Solving the Climate Problem for the Next 50 Years\nwith Current Technologies”, in Science, 13 August 2004.\n'®° Massachusetts Institute of Technology, 2009 “Update of the MIT 2003 Future of Nuclear Power Study”,\nMIT, Boston, http:/Aveb.mit.edu/nuclearpower/pdf/nuclearpower-update2009.pdf , accessed 26 May 2009.\n28° Vangbo Du & John Parsons, 2009 “Update on the cost of nuclear power”, MIT Boston;\nhttp:/Aveb.mit.edu/nse/pdfs/NFC-108.pdf, accessed 26 May 2009.\n**!

What is included in these costs is not always\nclear, whether they include finance for example, but since their source is companies actually\nexpecting to build plants, they must be regarded as reasonably realistic.\n\nThe plants for which no specific construction cost estimates have been reported in the press include\nComanche Peak, Harris, North Anna, Fermi, Calvert Cliffs, Callaway, Nine Mile Point, Bell Bend,\nAmarillo and Elmore. In February 2009, the Department of Energy shortlisted five projects (some\nfor 2-unit sites) for eligibility for loan guarantees. The full list of the plants chosen has not been\npublished” but it is reported to include the Summer project”, South Texas, a UniStar project,\nmost likely Calvert Cliffs and Comanche Peak, although this project was relegated to first alternate\nin May 2009.2\n\nAP-1000\n\nLevy.\" Progress Energy estimated that the overnight cost for the two AP-1000 reactors would be\nUS$10.5bn plus US$2.5bn for transmission facilities and US$3.9bn carrying cost/AFUDC\n{allowance for funds used during construction). A Securities and Exchange Commission filing\nfrom the end of 2008 showed that Progress Energy had signed a $7.65 billion contract with\nWestinghouse Electric to build two 1105 MW, AP-1000 reactors at the Levy site. It was not clear\nwhat the contract covered but the cost was reported to be the same as earlier utility estimates.°’ On\n1 May 2009 the company announced that the planning would be delayed by “a minimum of 20\nmonths”. The move aims to “spread some of the costs over a longer period of time”, as the\ncompany’s president stated.\" The deferral would result in a nuclear charge of $6.69/month for a\ntypical 1,000-kWh/month residential customer in 2010, down from a $12.63/month charge allowed\nby the state's nuclear cost recovery law.\n\nSummer.” SCE&G estimated the cost for constructing the two Summer plants alone, without\ntransmission and finance charges, would be US$9.8bn. The Summer project is reported to have\nbeen shortlisted by the US Department of Energy for loan guarantees.\n\nTurkey Point?! Florida Power & Light told the Florida Public Service Commission that it\nforecast an overnight construction cost for Turkey Point in the range of $3108-4540/kW. The total\nproject cost including inflation and interest payments meant the cost of the two AP1000s would be\n$12.3-18.0bn.\n\nVogtle.\" Georgia Power estimated that its 45.7% share of the Vogtle project for two AP-1000\nunits would cost it US$6.4bn, making the total cost about US$14bn. This cost is described as the\n“in-service cost’ and therefore should include finance costs.\n\nBellefonte.”\"” TVA has estimated the overnight construction cost for the two AP-1000 units would\nbe US$S.6-10.4bn.\n\nLee.”\"?

If it included finance, say an extra 25%, it would still be\nabout US$5200/kW. It now seems possible that the ESBWR design, which has been withdrawn\nfrom the UK certification process, will be abandoned and even that GE will drop out of the reactor\nsales business altogether.\n\nEPR\n\nThe Calvert Cliffs EPR project is reported to have been shortlisted for loan guarantees.”\\” However,\nof the seven EPR units announced, at least three projects appear to have been stopped. The utilities\nproposing the other four have not announced the expected cost. In April 2009, the Chairman of\nUniStar said Constellation has not publicly announced the estimated cost for Calvert Cliffs and that\nthose figures are confidential.\"\n\nABWR\n\nThe South Texas plant is the only ABWR proposal. It is for two units each of about 1380 MW.\nNRG now estimates the cost to be around $8 billion, or $2900/kW. The estimate is about 50%\nhigher than the figure of $5.2 billion given in a 21 June 2006 NRG press release. The project is\nreported to have been shortlisted for loan guarantees.\n\nAPWR\n\nThe two-unit Comanche Peak project is the only APWR project that has been announced but there\nhas been no specification of the estimated cost. The application for loan guarantees was reported to\nhave been shortlisted but was relegated to first reserve subsequently.\n\nIt is probably significant that of the 31 units announced in the USA, less than half have provided\nestimated costs and all of these use designs that have received certification from the NRC (ABWR\nand AP-1000), albeit with some design revisions to be made. Whether these revisions will raise the\ncost significantly remains to be seen — they are highly unlikely to reduce it.\n\nThe ABWR, which was certified more than a decade ago and must more realistically be\ncategorized as Generation III, looks particularly vulnerable to safety upgrades when it has its\ncertification renewed. It is surprising that none of the EPR applicants, a design that at least has\nconstruction experience and has been certified in Europe, has announced an estimated cost. The\novernight cost estimates seem to be clustering around the US$5000/KW mark.

Factors behind the increase in costs\nIn less than a decade, the estimated cost of new nuclear power plants has increased from\nUS$1000/kW to an average of about US$5000/kW, before significant construction experience has\nbeen accumulated. Even by the standards of the nuclear industry, this is a remarkable rate of\nincrease. What are the factors behind this increase? Clearly one factor is general inflation, which\nmay have increased prices by about a third in that time so the real increase is about four fold. The\nUS$1000/kW estimates were always regarded with suspicion by outside observers and the nuclear\nindustry increasingly seems to view these predictions in the same way as it docs Lewis Strauss’s\n‘too cheap to meter’ prediction — they would prefer they had not been made. However, a four-fold\nincrease arising simply from appraisal optimism (i.e., the natural inclination of proponents of a\ntechnology to underestimate costs) seems implausible and other factors are likely to have\ncontributed. Five factors seem particularly relevant.\nRapidly Rising Commodity Prices. Since 2003, global commodity prices have escalated at an\nunprecedented rate. In the period 2003-2007, nickel and copper increased in price by over 60% per\nyear, cement by more than 10% and steel by nearly 20%. 29 These price rises have increased the\nconstruction cost of all generation options but because nuclear plants are physically larger than\nother options, the impact on the economics of nuclear power is much greater. In the second half of\n2008, as the financial crisis began to lead to recession, commodity prices began to fall steeply.\n219 Nucleonics Week, \"Entergy revises construction plans, looks again to acquisitions\", 26 February 2009, p 1.\n© Standard & Poor’s, “Construction Costs to Soar for New US Nuclear Power Plants,” Ratings Direct,\n15 October 2008.\n\nWhile the rise in commodity price is plausible as a contributor to price escalation, quantifying its\nimpact would need a full inventory of the costs broken down by materials, land and labor.\nLack of Component Production Facilities. The low number of nuclear orders in the past twenty\nyears has meant that many component manufacturing facilities have closed down and there are now\nonly one or two certified suppliers of key components (see chapter II.). For example, the ultra\nheavy forgings needed to fabricate the pressure vessels are only produced in one factory (in Japan).\nAREVA announced in April 2009 that it was increasing its capacity to manufacture some heavy\ncomponents. However, this investment would increase nominal capacity from the equivalent of 1.7\nEPRs per year to only 2.7 EPRs per year.””! This shows how long it takes to build up capacity to\nmanufacture components even for experienced suppliers. New suppliers must be accredited by the\nAmerican Society of Mechanical Engineers (ASME) and France’s RCCM (Régles de Conception\net de Construction des Matériels) Certification. This requires a major effort in documentation and\nquality control to prove that the supplier is capable of meeting the required quality standards. This\nwill tend to raise prices, particularly once any spare capacity is taken up and, for example, Standard\nand Poor’s assumes that the first units ordered will be cheaper than their successors.” In the long-\nterm, if there are large numbers of new nuclear orders placed, component production facilities will\nbe built. However, building and certifying such facilities will take some time and involve huge\ninvestment costs. As a result, until ordering on a large scale is re-established, building such\nfacilities will represent a significant risk because there is no guarantee that demand will be there for\nthese facilities when they actually come on-line.\nShortages of the Necessary Nuclear Skills. As with components, the lack of recent nuclear orders\nand the ageing of the existing workforce have led to a serious shortage of qualified personnel (see\nchapter II). For example, Standard & Poor’s states:\nWe expect that the first few new nuclear units in the USA will rely somewhat on\nproject management experience from countries such as France and Japan where\nconstruction of nuclear units has continued relatively unabated since the US program’s\ndemise. Specifically, we expect companies like Electricité de France S.A. (EDF) and\nTokyo Electric Power Co. Inc. (TEPCO) to provide operational expertise.\nIn the UK, the British government has been unable to recruit sufficient safety inspectors to meet\ntargets regarding reviews of reactor designs. Nucleonics Week reported:”*\nNII [the Nuclear Installations Inspectorate] has been chronically understaffed, a\nsituation that threatens the timing of the GDA [generic design assessment] process.\nNI spokesman Mark Wheeler said in September that the agency needs 40 inspectors\nto complete the GDA on time, in addition to 20 now working on design assessments.\nExcluding the GDA work, the agency is about 22 inspectors short of the 192 needed,\nhe said. NII Chief Inspector Mike Weightman has said, however, that he believes\nabout 232 inspectors are needed to do all the regulatory work required by existing and\nnew nuclear installations.\nThe UK Commons Innovation, Universities, Scicnce and Skills Committee found a scrious\nshortage of skills for all nuclear activities.2>\nWeakness of the US Dollar. The increase in costs measured in US dollars may in part have been\ndue to the weakness of the US dollar since the end of 2005. This has meant that costs measured, for\nexample, in Euro will have escalated somewhat less than dollar prices. Weakness of the dollar may\n21 AREVA, “AREVA launches the Chalon 1300 plan”, AREVA Press Release, Paris, 2 April 2009.\n2 Standard & Poor’s, “Construction Costs to Soar for New US Nuclear Power Plants,” Ratings Direct,\n15 October 2008.\n23 Thidem.\nann MacLachlan, “HSE Preparing to Contract for Technical Safety Expertise”, Inside NRC,\n10 November 2008.\n228 House of Commons Innovation, Universities, Science and Skills Committee, 2009 “Engineering: Turning\nideas into reality”, Fourth report of session 2008/09 HC 50-1, The Stationery Office, London;\nhittp:/Avww.publications.parliament.uk/pa/em200809/emselect/cmdius/50/5002.htm, accessed on 3 April\n2009.\n\nalso have contributed to commodity price increases measured in dollars. The value of the dollar fell\nfrom November 2005 when the Euro was worth US$1.17 to July 2008, when it was worth\nUS$1.57. By November 2008 the value of the dollar had increased sharply so that the Euro was\nworth US$1.27, yet by December 2008 it had fallen again to US$1.40.\nGreater Caution by Utilities. Utilities can no longer assume that they will be allowed to pass on\nwhatever costs they incur when building a power plant. Where there are competitive markets, if\ncosts are too high, utilities risk bankruptcy, as happened in 2002 to the privatized British nuclear\ngenerator, British Energy.”5 Where tariffs are still regulated, the utility will be relying on\nelectricity regulators to allow them to recover their costs. This will force utilities to be more\nconservative in their cost estimations to reduce the risk that the actual costs will exceed the forecast\ncosts.\nIt remains to be seen how far these factors are reversible and whether prices might fall. If they were\nto fall it would be unprecedented in the history of nuclear power. Commodity prices have already\nbegun to decline from their peak of mid-2008 and this may moderate pressure on prices. However,\nthe second and third factors, shortages of manufacturing capacity and skills can only be solved over\na period of a decade or more and, if ordering does recommence to any great extent, the price\npressure will grow as utilities compete for scarce resources. The level of the dollar is impossible to\npredict, but this volatility is itself a serious issue. Vendors or buyers who choose the wrong\ncurrency for their sales or purchases (i.e., one that loses a significant amount of value against other\ncurrencies) will stand to lose a lot of money. Utilities will also know that even if energy market\nliberalization measures do stall and competition is muted, they will no longer be able to rely on\ngovernments and regulators allowing them to pass unforeseen costs on to consumers.\nSo, overall, it seems highly unlikely that prices will fall significantly. All previous experience\nsuggests that priccs will tend to rise as the designs arc translated from the drawing board to\nconstruction site.\nTI1.3.1.4. Cost of capital\nLarge projects such as nuclear power plants are financed by a mixture of debt (i.e. borrowing) and\nequity (e.g. financing from cash flow or from partners). Debt is usually cheaper than equity. For\nexample, for its base casc, the MIT study’ assumed that the debt and equity shares in financing\nnew nuclear plants would be equal and that cost of capital (net) for equity would be 12% and for\ndebt would be 5% giving a real weighted average cost of capital (WACC) of 8.5%. The Keystone\nstudy”* follows these assumptions for its high case but assumes for its low case that the cost of\nequity can be reduced to 9% giving a real WACC of 7%. Keystone does note that (p 37):\nIn the past few years, Wall Street has become significantly less comfortable with the\nmerchant plant model, and even very strong non-utility generators building plants in\ncompetitive wholesale markets now need 65% to 70% equity to access the bond\nmarket.\nHowever, it does not use this case in its scenarios. If we assume a requirement for 70% equity at\n12%, this gives a real WACC of just under 10%.\nWhether these figures are realistic is not clear. When the British electricity market was opened to\ncompetition in 1990, there was a huge wave of orders for combined cycle gas-fired plants and it\nwas widely reported that the real discount rate for these plants was 15%.” The nuclear forecasts of\n26 Stephen Thomas, “The Collapse of British Energy: The True Cost of Nuclear Power or a British Failure?”\nEconomia delle fonti di energia ¢ dell’ ambiente, no. 1-2, 2003, pp. 61-78.\n27 Massachusetts Institute of Technology, “The future of nuclear power” MIT, Boston, 2003,\nhttp://web.mit.edu/nuclearpower/ accessed on 3 April 2009.\n#8 The Keystone Center, “Nuclear Power Joint Fact-Finding”, Keystone Center, Keystone, 2007,\nhittp:/Avww.nc.doc.gov/pdfpdfFi/pt_KeystoneReportNKeystoneReportNuclearPowKey_2007.pdf , accessed\non 3 April 2009.\n229 Tohn Surrey, “The British Electricity Experiment”, Earthscan, London, 1997.\n\n2002-2004 seemed to be oblivious to this experience and, for example, several studies still\n\nprojected a real cost of capital of 8% or less.\"\n\nIn the past, before energy-market liberalization took hold, the cost of finance for nuclear projects\n\nwas low because utilities were guaranteed to be able to recover any costs they incurred from\n\nconsumers. Any problems of financing nuclear power plants arose from the general credit rating of\nthe company or the country involved. Thus, countries such as Turkey did have problems financing\nnuclear plants. The only specific problem for nuclear power was that the World Bank and the other\nmajor public international development banks do not lend money for nuclear power plants and this\ncut off a low cost source of finance. The World Bank’s lending advice states:”*!\nNuclear plants are thus uneconomic because at present and projected costs they are\nunlikely to be the least-cost alternative. There is also evidence that the cost figures\nusually cited by suppliers are substantially underestimated and often fail to take\nadequately into account waste disposal, decommissioning, and other environmental\ncosts.\n\nTn a similar way, the Asian Development Bank (ADB) recently restated its “policy of non-\n\ninvolvement” in the financing of nuclear power:?”\n\nNevertheless, in spite of its sustainable and operational benefits, nuclear power\ndevelopment faces a number of barriers, such as public concerns related to nuclear\nproliferation, waste management, safety issues, high investment costs, long lead times,\nand commercial acceptability of new technologies. Overcoming these barriers is\ndifficult and open public debate will be required to convince the public about the\nbenefits of nuclear power. MDBs [Multilateral Development Banks] have traditionally\navoided financing nuclear power plants. In the context of the former Soviet Union\nstates, the EBRD’s [European Bank for Reconstruction and Development] current\nenergy policy includes financing safety measures of nuclear plants, decommissioning\nand environmental rehabilitation, and promoting an efficient nuclear regulatory\nframework. In view of concerns related to nuclear technology, procurement\nlimitations, proliferation risks, fuel availability, and environmental and safety\nconcems, ADB will maintain its current policy of non-involyement in the financing of\nnuclear power generation.\n\nIna March 2008 presentation, Rinaldo S. Brutoco, President of the World Business Council, stated:\nFrom a business perspective, nuclear power has failed to fulfill its potential in the\nmarketplace. In the early 1980s, following Washington Public Power Supply System’s\n$2.25 billion bond default (the largest default in utility history), Wall Street rated\nnuclear power plants ‘high risk’ and tured off the money machine.”?\n\nHowever, for liberalized markets or systems such as some of the US states where regulators cannot\nbe guaranteed to pass on costs, it was long believed that nuclear power orders were infeasible\nbecause of the risks markets posed for such an economically inflexible technology as nuclear\npower.\nThere are three main ways that banks can be protected, at least in part, from this risk: by electricity\nconsumers, by government credit guarantees, i.e., taxpayers and by vendors through fixed price\ncontracts. In all of these scenarios, the protection is only as strong as the counterparty is. Electricity\nconsumer protections work through rate setting boards that have in the past disallowed cost\noverruns. Vendor guarantees can be litigated, as they are in the case of Olkiluoto. More on these\nissues below.\n\n230 Stephen Thomas, Peter Bradford, Antony Froggatt & David Milborrow, “The economics of nuclear\n\npower”, Amsterdam, Greenpeace International, 2007.\n\n231 World Bank, “Guidelines for Environmental Assessment of Energy and Industry Projects”, World Bank\n\ntechnical paper No. 1534/1992, Environmental Assessment Sourcebook, Vol, III.\n\n282 Asian Development Bank, “Energy Policy”, Working Paper, January 2009.\n\n28 Rinaldo S.Brutoco, “Nuclear Power Finance and Development in the Climate Change Era”, American Bar\n\nAssociation Presentation, 5 March 2008.\n\nConsumers\nIn general, the impact of electricity market liberalisation means that consumers cannot now be\nassumed to be willing or able to bear the risk. However, some very particular arrangements for the\nOlkiluoto-3 project mean that in this case, they have been. The buyer, Teollisuuden Voima Oy\n{TVO), is an organization unique to Finland. PVO (Pohjolan Voima Oy), the largest shareholder,\nholds 60% of TVO’s shares. PVO is a not-for-profit company owned by Finnish electric-intensive\nindustry, which generates about 15% of Finland’s electricity. Its shareholders are entitled to\npurchase electricity at cost in proportion to the size of their equity stakes. In return, they are\nobliged to pay fixed costs according to the percentage of their stakes and variable costs in\nproportion to the volume of electricity they consume. The other main shareholder in TVO is the\nlargest Finnish electricity company, Fortum, with 25% of the shares. The majority of shares in\nFortum are owned by the Finnish Government. This arrangement is effectively a life-of-plant\ncontract for the output of Olkiluoto-3 at prices set to fully cover costs.\nIf it is assumed that for other cases, consumers will not bear the risk, this leaves credit guarantecs\nand turnkey contracts.\nCredit guarantees\nEven before the financial crisis, the risk premium involved in nuclear projects was a severe barrier\nto new orders. At the top of the utilities’ and vendors’ wish lists for government support was credit\nguarantecs. These shift the risk of utility failure from the vendor to taxpayers. One of the factors\nthat made the Olkiluoto-3 order financeable (see below) was export credit guarantees from the\nFrench and Swedish governments, This made loans at only a 2.6% interest rate possible,\nThe US program\n\nIn February 2002, the Bush Administration announced the Nuclear 2010 program, aimed at re-\nstarting nuclear ordering in the USA. The rationale was that Generation III+ designs would be\neconomically competitive but that initial financial and regulatory hurdles would prevent their being\nordered. The policy to overcome these barriers was therefore to streamline regulatory processes,\nensure regulatory approval for a number of new designs and provide subsidies for units at up to\nthree sites (perhaps up to four or five units). The objective was:\n\nto complete the first-of-a-kind Generation III+ reactor technology development and to\n\ndemonstrate the untested Federal regulatory and licensing processes for the siting,\n\nconstruction, and operation of new nuclear plants.\nThe program was unrealistically optimistic on time-scales and was based on an assumption that a\nnew nuclear unit could be on-line by 2010. Loan guarantees were offered so that utilities could\nborrow at government Treasury bond rates. If we assume that the Treasury bond rate is 4% and the\ncost of equity is 9%, this might bring the WACC down to about 7%.\nWhen the program was launched, the estimated construction cost of a nuclear uit was about\nUS$2bn and to provide guarantees to cover 80% of the debt, if debt made up half the finance cost,\nwould have required guarantees for five plants worth about US$4bn. Since that time, the cost per\nreactor, as well as the coverage of the loan guarantees grew rapidly, as did industry expectations\nabout the number of projects the program was supposed to cover. In 2003, the Congressional\nResearch Service estimated that the taxpayer liability for loan guarantees covering up to 50% of the\ncost of building six to eight new reactors would be US$14-16 billion.” The Congressional Budget\nOffice concluded that the risk of loan default by industry would be “well above 50 percent” and\n234 United States Department of Energy, “A Roadmap to Deploy New Nuclear Power Plants in the United\nStates by 2010”, Washington, US-DOE, 2001.\n235 Congressional Research Service, “Potential Cost of Nuclear Power Plant Subsidies in $.14”, 7 May 2003.\nRequested by Senator Ron Wyden.\n\nthat taking account of the recovery from costs by selling equipment (i.c., government could recover\nhalf its costs) would bring the net cost to government to about 25%.\"\nThe Department of Energy estimates that loan guarantees could reduce total generation cost by\nA0%:\nA new merchant nuclear power plant with 100% loan guarantee and 80/20 debt to\nequity ratio could realize up to 2 39% savings in the levelized cost of electricity when\ncompared to conventional financing with a 50-50 debt to equity ratio.\nThere are restrictions on the type and number of plants that would be eligible for loan guarantees.\nThe Congressional Budget Office stated:?**\nThe Department of Energy has indicated that it will deny a utility’s application for a\nloan guarantee if the project is not deemed to be both innovative (essentially, in the\ncase of nuclear technology, a plant design that has not been built in the United States)\nand commercially viable, and that no more than three plants based on each advanced\nreactor design can be considered innovative.\nIf three units of each of the five designs of plant under consideration were built, 15 units would be\neligible for loan guarantees. But while utilities have been keen to stand in line for these handouts,\nwith 30-40 plants now at various stages of planning, it seems increasingly likely that only plants\nwith loan guarantees will be ordered. For fiscal year 2008/09, Congress made US$42.5bn available\nin Federal Ioan guarantees for ‘innovative’ generation sources, of which US$18.5bn would be for\nnew nuclear plants, and $2bn for front-end fuel chain facilities such as enrichment.” If the new US\ngovernment really wants to get a significant proportion of the proposed 30-40 reactors built, the\n$18.5bn will not go far. Utilities have already filed applications for about US$122bn worth of loan\nguarantees for 21 new nuclear power plants.\nHf we assume that a new plant will cost no more than US$7-9bn and industry gets its wish that 80%\nof this cost (compared to 80% of the debt originally) is covered by federal loan guarantees,\nguarantees worth about US$100bn will be needed to build just the 15 ‘innovative’ units. If 80% of\nthe cost is covered by loan guarantees and money is borrowed at, say, 4% with equity 9%, this\nwould bring the real WACC down to 5%. To build 35 units, guarantees of US$230bn would be\nneeded. The utilities hope that loan guarantees for the remaining 20% of the total cost will be\noffered by the Japanese and French governments, which are the countries where the vendors are\nbased. US legal requirements state that utilities must provide a ‘significant’ equity stake. Whether\nthe utilities can persuade government to forget this requirement in favor of loans guaranteed by the\nFrench or Japanese governments remains to be seen. By October 2008, 17 power companies had\nalready applied for $122bn in federal loan guarantees.” If, as argued by Standard & Poor's,”\nskills and component bottlenecks mean that only ‘a few’ units can be supplied per year to the US\nmarket the need for this very large number of guarantees may not arise.\nIn practice, the ESBWR now looks increasingly likely to be abandoned in favor of the ABWR,\nwhile the APWR only has one interested buyer, so perhaps only 10 units will qualify for loan\nguarantecs and this might bring the loan guarantcc requirement down to less than US$60bn.\n26 Congressional Budget Office, “Cost estimate of $.14, Energy Policy Act of 2003”, (Washington,\nCongressional Budget Office), http://www.cbo.gov/doc.cfm?index=4206 .\n257 Prepared remarks of Deputy Energy Secretary Dennis Spurgeon at the second annual “Nuclear Fuel cycle\nmonitor global nuclear renaissance summit”, Alexandria, Virginia, 23 July 2008.\n238 Congressional Budget Office,““Nuclear Power’s Role in Generating Electricity”, 2008, p. 33,\nhttp://www.cbo. gow/ftpdocs/91xx/doc9133/05-02-Nuclear.pdf .\n9 Platt’s Global Power Report, “Nuclear Energy Institute president says Congress needs to boost loan\nguarantees”, 16 October 2008.\n*° At http://www lgprogram.energy.gov/press/100208.pdf .\n24 Standard & Poor’s, “Construction Costs To Soar For New U.S. Nuclear Power Plants”, 2008.\n\nOlkiluoto\nThe details of how the plant is being financed were not published, but the European Renewable\nEnergies Federation (EREF) and Greenpeace separately made complaints to the European\nCommission in December 2004 that the financing arrangements contravened European State Aid\nregulations. The Commission did not begin to investigate the complaints until October 2006 and, in\nSeptember 2007, the Competition Commission dropped the case. According to EREF, the\nBayerische Landesbank (BLB, owned by the state of Bavaria) led the syndicate (with\nHandelsbanken, Nordea, BNP Paribas and J.P. Morgan) that provided the majority of the finance.\nIt provided a loan of €1.95 billion, about 60% of the total cost at a remarkably low interest rate of\n2.6%.\nTwo export credit institutions are also involved: France’s Coface, with a €610 million export credit\nguarantee covering AREVA supplies, and the Swedish Export Agency SEK for €110 million.\nAgain, this is a surprising feature as export credit guarantees are usually offered only for exports to\ndeveloping countries with unstable economies, not a category that Finland falls into.\nSouth Africa\n\nSouth Africa has, for the past decade, been trying to commercialize Pebble Bed Modular Reactor\n(PBMR) technology, but progress has been slow and the publicly-owned South African utility,\nEskom prioritized orders for ‘conventional’ nuclear plants, cither the AREVA NP EPR or the\nWestinghouse AP-1000. It has a budget of R343bn (US$34bn) to build 16 GW of new coal and\nnuclear plants by 2017. In the longer term, it plans to build 20 GW of nuclear plants by 2025. But\nat US$5000/kW, its budget would provide less than 7 GW of new nuclear capacity. Eskom faces an\nadditional challenge of a falling credit rating, reduced by Moody's August 2008 to Baa2. Finally in\nNovember 2008, Eskom admitted defeat and scrapped its tender because the scale of investment\nwas too high. This was despite the willingness of Coface to offer export credit guarantees™” and\ndespite AREVA’s claims that it could have arranged 85% of the finance. In February 2009,\nEskom also abandoned plans to build PBMRs.”“ Engineering News reported that the issue was the\ncredit rating of Eskom:\n\nIn fact, ratings agency Standard & Poor’s said on Thursday that South Africa's\n\nNational Treasury needed to extend “unconditional, timely guarantees” across all\n\nEskom's debt stock if it hoped to sustain the utility's current BBB+ investment-grade\n\ncredit rating. The National Treasury was still to anmounce the details of the package.\n\nThe Eskom board had, as a result, decided to terminate the commercial procurement\n\nprocess to select the preferred bidder for the construction of the Nuclear-1 project.\nThis illustrates the fact that while loan guarantees protect vendors from utility default and allow the\nutility access to lower cost finance than would otherwise have been on offer, they do nothing to\nprotect the utility from bankruptcy. Thus, if taking the loan would damage the credit rating of the\nutility, a loan guarantee might not be sufficient to persuade the utility to go ahead.\n\nOther loan guarantee agencies\n\nThere has also been speculation that the French and Japanese governments would offer loan\nguarantees in the USA for plants supplied by their national companies.“* AREVA NP is controlled\nby French interests, indeed, it is majority owned by the French state.“” The French government has\n28 Nucleonics Week, “French export credit agency to insure loans for Cgnpe, Eskom”, 21 August 2008.\n243 The Star, “Nuclear bid had funding - AREVA”, 30 January 2009.\n244 PBMR pty [2x], “PBMR considering change in product strategy”, News release, 5 February 2009,\nhttp://www _pbmir.co.za/index.asp?Content=218&Article=1048Y ear=2009\n*# Enginecring News, 2008 “Eskom terminates Nuclear 1 procurement process, but SA still committed to\nnuclear”, 5 December 2008.\n246 Nucleonics Week “US working with allies to change global rules for nuclear financing”, 23 October 2008,\n247 AREVA NP is 66% owned by AREVA with the remaining 34% held by Siemens.

Mitsubishi has its own design, USAPWR. Hitachi\nis collaborating with GE to offer the ESBWR and, perhaps, the ABWR. Westinghouse, which is\noffering the AP-1000, although largely based in the USA, is now owned by Toshiba, which is also\noffering the ABWR. Standard & Poor’s believes the Japanese government will provide finance for\norders from Japanese vendors through the Japan Bank for International Cooperation.\n\nJapan set up the Japan Finance Corp on 1 October 2008 to provide investment credits for nuclear\nprojects in developed countries.“ These guarantees would complement the US guarantees and\nmight reduce the scale of US loan guarantees needed,\n\nIn general export credit agencies are used to reduce the financial risks — and therefore costs —\nassociated with exporting technologies. Historically, and currently, this is true for the nuclear\nsector. For example between 1959 and 1993 the US EX-IM Bank made available US$7.7 billion\nfor nuclear exports, while in Canada the Export Development Corporation has made available\nfinancing for the sale of reactors to India, Pakistan, Korea, Argentina, Romania and China over the\nlast fifty years. Similar support can be seen for German reactor builders.\n\nTIL.3.1.4, Political issues\n\nThere are problems with the OECD’s agreement on export credits, the Arrangement on Guidelines\nfor Officially Supported Export Credits (established 1978). The Arrangement is a gentlemen's\nagreement, not an official OECD document. It provides special treatment for certain sectors,\nnotably nuclear power plant equipment, materials and services. The Arrangement allows a 15-year\npayback period for nuclear export credits—three more than for conventional power plants and five\nmore than for other types of equipment—but this is not seen as long enough for nuclear plants.\nThe Participants to the Arrangement were due to meet in Paris in November 2008, but by end\nJanuary 2009, there had been no reports on whether the meeting took place and, if it did, what the\noutcome was.\n\nProviding guarantees for one order, like Olkiluoto-3, which was seen as opening up the market for\nFrench exports might be acceptable to French and Japanese taxpayers. However, if such guarantees\nare a condition for all orders to be placed, taxpayers will see this as a blank cheque. If the\nOlkiluoto-3 order does lead to a default or the US Congressional Budget Office’s estimate that the\nrisk of loan default by industry would be “well above 50 percent”, loan guarantees will be seen as a\nhighly risky option.\n\nU11.3.1.5. Turnkey contracts\n\nThe financial assurance a turnkey contract seemed to give was an important element in AREVA\nNP’s winning the Olkiluoto contract and also the French and Swedish governments’ offering loan\nguarantees. However, it was surprising that AREVA NP was so desperate for the order that it was\nprepared to take the massive financial risk a turnkey contract involves. There have been few (if\nany) genuine ‘whole plant’ (as opposed to individual component) turnkey contracts since the\nnotorious 12/13** turnkey orders that launched commercial ordering in the USA in 1964-66\".\nThese lost the vendors large amounts of money although they did achieve one of their aims, which\n48 Nucleonics Week, “French export credit agency to insure loans for Cgnpe, Eskom”, 21 August 2008.\n\n4 Nuclconics Weeks, “Japan clears way for loan guarantees in US”, 25 September 2008,\n\n250 Nucleonics Week, “US working with allies to change global rules for nuclear financing”, 23 October\n2008.\n\n251 There were 12 strictly turnkey orders but a 13\", San Onofre, is sometimes included.\n\n°5 Irvine Bupp & Jean-Claude Derian, “Light Water: How the Nuclear Dream Dissolved”, NY. Basic Books,\n1978.\n\nwas to convince utilities that nuclear was little more challenging than, say, a coal-fired plant and\ncould be ordered with confidence as a proven technology. Turnkey orders for nuclear plants are\nmuch more risky for vendors compared to other power plants because so much of the work in\nnuclear construction is on-site engineering and construction, a process that is notoriously difficult\nto control. It is also not easy for the vendor to control the quality of work given the large number of\ncontractors involved.\nStandard & Poor’s was clear in a recent report that turnkey contracts would not be on offer?\n\nWe expect no EPC [engincering, procurement and construction] contracts to be fully\n\nwrapped through a fixed-price, date certain mechanism.\nTop AREVA representatives in private talks also made it clear that the Olkiluoto-3 fixed price\ncontract was a one-off agreement not to be repeated.\nUU.3.1.6. Reliability\nReliability has always been the neglected element of the fixed cost equation. The nuclear industry\nalways projected high reliability for plants. A good measure of the reliability of the plant and how\neffective it is at producing saleable output is the load factor (capacity factor in US parlance). The\nload factor is calculated as the output in a given period of time expressed as a percentage of the\noutput that would have been produced if the unit had operated uninterrupted at its full design output\nlevel throughout the period concerned.”\nHigher utilization improves the economics of nuclear power because the large fixed costs can be\nspread over more saleable units of output than if utilization is lower. In addition, nuclear power\nplants are physically inflexible. Frequent shutdowns or variations in output reduce both efficiency\nand the lifetime of components. As a result, nuclear power plants are operated on ‘base-load’\n(continuously at full power) except in the very few countries (e.g., France) where the nuclear\ncapacity represents such a high proportion of overall generating capacity that this is not possible.\nUnlike construction cost, load factor can be precisely and unequivocally measured and load factor\ntables are regularly published by trade publications such as Nucleonics Week and Nuclear\nEngineering International.\nAs with construction cost, load factors of operating plants have been much poorer than forecast.\nThe assumption by vendors and those promoting the technology has been that nuclear plants would\nbe extremely reliable with the only interruptions to service being for maintenance and refueling\n(some designs of plant such as the AGR and Candu are refueled continuously and need only shut\ndown for maintenance) giving load factors of 85-95%. However, performance was poor and around\n1980, the average load factor for all plants worldwide was about 60%. To illustrate the impact on\nthe economics of nuclear power, if we assume fixed costs represent two thirds of the overall cost of\npower if the load factor is 90%, the overall cost would go up by a third if load factor was only 60%.\nTo the extent that poor load factors are caused by equipment failures, the additional cost of\nmaintenance and repair resulting would further increase the operations and maintenance cost.\nHowever, from the late 1980s onwards, the nuclear industry worldwide has made strenuous efforts\nto improve performance. Worldwide, load factors now average more than 80%. The USA has an\nannual average of about 90% compared to less than 60% in 1980, although the average lifetime\nload factor of America’s nuclear power plants is still only 70%.\nOnly 7 of the 414 operating reactors with at least a year’s service and which have full performance\nrecords have a lifetime load factor in excess of 90% and only the top 100 plants have a lifetime\nload factor of more than 80%. Interestingly, the top 13 plants ate sited in only three countries: six\nin South Korea, five in Germany and two in Finland. This suggests that performance is not random\n233 Standard & Poor’s, “Construction Costs To Soar For New U.S. Nuclear Power Plants”, 2008.\n24 Note that where reactors are derated, some organisations (e.g., the IAEA) quote the foad factor on the\nauthorized output level rather than the design level. While this may give some uscful information on the\nreliability of the plant, for economic analysis purposes, the design rating should be used because that is what\nthe purchaser paid to receive.\n\nbut is determined as much by the skills that are brought to bear and how well the plants are\nmanaged as by the technology and the supplier.\nNew reactor designs may emulate the level of reliability achieved by the top 2% of existing\nreactors, as industry frequently assumes. However, they may equally suffer from ‘teething\nproblems’ like earlier generations. The French experience in the late 1990s with the N4 design is\nparticularly salutary. The four units of this design took from 6-12 years to build. A series of\ntechnical problems led to the period between first criticality and commercial operation, usually a\nfew months, taking from 29-49 months. Reliability in this period was very poor and the average\nload factor for these four units for the first four calendar years after criticality was only 46%.\nNote that in an economic analysis, the performance in the first years of operation, when teething\nproblems are likely to emerge, will have much more weight than that of later years because of the\ndiscounting process. This problem may be compounded if advance sales contracts have been put in\nplace, and replacement power must be procured on the spot market in the event of delays.\nPerformance may decline in the later years of operation as equipment wears out and has to be\nreplaced, and improvements to the design are needed to bring the plant nearer current standards of\nsafety. This decline in end-of-life performance will probably not weigh very heavily in an\neconomic analysis because of discounting.\nIIL.3.2. Operating costs\nTIL.3.2.1, Non-fuel O&M costs\nOperating costs can be split into non-fuel operating costs and fuel costs. The non-fuel operations\nand maintenance (O&M) costs are seldom given much attention in studies of nuclear economics.\nAs discussed below, the cost of fuel is relatively low and has been reasonably predictable.\nHowever, the assumption of low running costs was proved wrong in the late [980s and early 1990s.\nwhen a small number of US nuclear power plants were retired because the cost of operating them\n{not including repaying the fixed costs) was found to be greater than cost of building and operating\na replacement gas-fired plant. It emerged that non-fuel O&M costs were on average in excess of\nUS$22/MWh while fuel costs were then more than US$12/MWh.* Streauous efforts were made to\nreduce non-fuel nuclear O&M costs and by the mid-1990s, average non-fuel O&M costs had fallen\nto about US$12.5/MWh and fuel costs to US$4.5/MWh.\nHowever, it is important to note that these cost reductions were achieved mainly by improving the\nreliability of the plants rather than actually reducing costs. Some larger repair costs are categorized\nas ‘net capital additions’ and are reflected in an increased capital value rather than higher O&M\ncosts where they should, more appropriately, be placed. Unlike operating costs in many industries,\na large proportion of the O&M costs in the nuclear sector are largely fixed. The cost of employing\nthe staff and maintaining the plant, for example, vary little according to the level of output of the\nplant. As with fixed costs, the more power that is produced, the lower the O&M cost per MWh.\nThe threat of early closure on grounds of economics has now generally been lifted in the USA\nbecause, on a marginal cost basis, the plants are low cost generators.\nIt is also worth noting that British Energy, which was essentially given its eight nuclear power\nplants when it was created in 1996, collapsed financially in 2002 because income from operation of\nthe plants barely covered operating costs. This was in part due to high fuel costs, especially the cost\nof reprocessing spent fuel, an operation only carried out now in Britain and France. British Energy\nhas subsequently acknowledged that expenditure in that time was not sufficient to maintain the\nplants in good condition?®*. Average O&M costs for British Energy’s eight plants, including fuel,\n255 For statistics on O&M costs, see Nuclear Energy Institute,\nhttp:/Avww.nci.org/index.asp?catnum=2&catid=95 .\n256 Th its re-launch prospectus, British Energy stated: “We believe that the loss of output is indicative of a\ndeterioration of the materiel condition of plant over time in part caused by inadequate investment over the\nlast few years which has resulted in an inerease in our maintenance backlog and failure to carry out required\nmaintenance on a timely basis.” Available at http://www. british-energy.co.uk/documents/Prospectus_-\n\nPart ILpdf.\n\nvaried between about £16.5 and 20.0/MWh from 1997-2004. By 2008, they had doubled and in the\nfirst six months of fiscal year 2008/09, operating costs including fuel were £41.3/MWh, two and a\nhalf times the level of only five years previously, because of poor performance at some plants (see\nTable 5). It is only the good fortune of rapidly rising wholesale prices since 2005 that has prevented\nBritish Energy from falling into a much worse position than in 2002. Now that wholesale electricity\nprices are falling sharply, British Energy, owned since the end of 2008 by EDF, may well suffer\nfrom financial problems again.\nTable 5 Operating Costs of British Energy Nuclear Power Plants\nTWh) _|_cost (€/MWh) | price (£/MWh)\n\n[2002703 [63.8 [86 83\n\n[200304 Toso [6S 69\n\n[2o0so6_ | 60.4 [228 [320\nSource: British Energy (various) \"Annual Report and Accounts\", British Energy, Livingston.\nWhile UK operating costs are fully documented and reliably reported (the company’s only business\nis effectively generating nuclear power so there is nowhere to ‘hide’ the costs), the fact that seven\nout of eight of the stations are of a British design not built elsewhere means that these operating\ncosts may not be more broadly representative. The only other country that has, in the past, reliably\nfully reported operating costs is the USA. US utility figures on operating costs have, in the past,\nhad to be submitted to state and federal energy regulators who oversee energy prices. In some\ncases, electricity markets in the USA have been opened to competition and in these cases, utilities\nargue that operating costs are commercially sensitive and the utilities no longer publish them. Only\n34 out of 65 US nuclear power stations (stations with more than one unit do not report separate\nfigures for each unit) now publish their operating costs, but this should still be a representative\nsample. In 2007, the average non-fuel operations and maintenance cost for these 34 stations was\nUS$13.97/MWh (US$18.81 including fuel) compared to US$13.59/MWh in 2006 (US$18.18\nineluding fuel).**” While this appears significantly lower than current UK costs, the difference is\npartly accounted for by the higher UK fuel costs and by the higher US load factors. As argued.\nbelow, US fuel costs are artificially depressed because the government takes responsibility for the\nspent fuel for a fixed fee of US$1/MWh, a figure that is likely to be significantly less than the\nactual cost. UK fuel is mostly reprocessed at a much higher cost than the forecast cost of direct\ndisposal so UK fuel costs are higher than in countries that do not reprocess their fuel. The higher\nload factors of the US plants, in 2007 the average for the plants that reported costs was over 92%,\nmeans that the costs can be spread much more thinly than is the case for the UK where the average\nload factor is less than 70%. The total annual expenditure on operating and maintaining the US\nplants, excluding fuel, is not so different between the UK and the USA, at least it was not until UK.\ncosts began to escalate dramatically from 2005 onwards. Utilities in other countries claim lower\noperating costs but these figure are not independently verified so they must be treated with some\nskepticism.\nIIT.3.2.2. Fuel costs\nFuel costs have fallen as the world uranium price has been low since the mid-1970s although in\nrecent years, the price of uranium has risen, more than doubling in 2006. These higher uranium\n*57 Nucleonics Week, “US operating costs increased modestly in 2007”, 30 October 2008, p. 1.\n\ncosts have yet to be reflected in fuel costs for reactors, although given that much of the cost of fuel\nrelates to processing, such as enrichment, the effect will be limited.\n\nUS fuel costs average about $5.0/MWh but these are arguably artificially low because the US\ngovernment assumes responsibility for disposal of spent fuel in return for a flat fee of $1/MWh;\nand because secondary supplies of uranium, such as from blending down Russian high enriched\nuranium, have depressed prices. The waste fee is an arbitrary price set more than two decades ago.\nWhile it is periodically reviewed for “adequacy”, the value is not based on actual experience — no\nfuel disposal facilities exist in the USA or anywhere else — and all the US spent fuel remains in\ntemporary store pending the construction of a spent fuel repository. This was expected to be at\nYucca Mountain in Nevada but the Obama administration has effectively killed this proposal by\ncutting all but some R & D funding.\n\nFuel costs are a small part of the projected cost of nuclear power. The issue of spent fuel disposal is\ndifficult to evaluate. Reprocessing is expensive and does little to help waste disposal. Reprocessing\nmerely splits the spent fuel into different parts and does not reduce either the amount of\nradioactivity that must be dealt with or the heat load. Indeed, reprocessing creates a large amount of\nlow and intermediate level waste because all the equipment and material used in reprocessing\nbecomes radioactive waste. The previous contract between BNFL and British Energy, before its\ncollapse, was reported to be worth £300m per year, which equates to about £5/MWh. The new\ncontract is expected to save British Energy about £150-200m per year, although this will be\npossible only because of underwriting of losses at BNFL by the government. The cost of disposing\nof high-level waste is hard to estimate because no facilities have been built or are even under\nconstruction and any cost projections should have a very wide margin for error.\n\nII1.3.3. Decommissioning costs\n\nThese are difficult to estimate because there is little experience with decommissioning commercial-\nscale plants. The cost of disposal of waste, especially intermediate or long-lived waste, which\naccounts for a high proportion of estimated decommissioning costs, is similarly uncertain.\nHowever, even schemes that provide a very high level of assurance that funds will be available\nwhen needed, will not make a major difference to the overall economics. For example, if the owner\nwas required to place the (discounted) sum forecast to be needed to carry out decommissioning at\nthe start of the life of the plant, this would add only about 10% to the construction cost, The British\nEnergy segregated fund, which did not cover the first phase of decommissioning, required\ncontributions of less than £20m per year equating to a cost of only about £0.3/MWh.\n\nThe problems come if the cost has been initially underestimated, if the funds are lost or if the\ncompany collapses before the plant completes its expected lifetime. All of these problems have\noccurred in Britain. The expected decommissioning cost of the UK’s first generation plants has\ngone up several-fold in real terms over the past couple of decades. In 1990, when the CEGB was\nprivatized, the accounting provisions made from contributions by consumers were not passed on to\nthe successor company, Nuclear Electric. The subsidy that applied from 1990-96, described by\nMichael Heseltine** as being to ‘decommission old, unsafe nuclear plants’ was in fact spent as\ncash flow by the company owning the plant and the unspent portion has now been absorbed by the\nUK Treasury. The collapse of British Energy has meant that a significant proportion of the\ndecommissioning costs of the old nuclear power plants will be paid by future taxpayers.\n\nlIL.3.4. Lifetime\n\nOne of the features of Generation JII/III+ plants compared to their predecessors is that they are\ndesigned to have a life of about 60 years while their predecessors generally had a design life of\nabout half that. For a technology dominated by fixed costs, it might be expected that doubling the\nlife would significantly reduce fixed costs per unit because they would be operating much longer to\nrecover these costs. In practice, this does not apply. Commercial loans must be repaid over no more\nthan 15-20 years and in a discounted cash flow calculation, costs and benefits more than 10-15\n258 President of the Board of Trade, Michael Heseltine, Hansard, 19 October 1992.\n\nyears forward have little weight, One of the benefits of government loan guarantees, such as those\non offer in the United States, is that their term can be as long as 30 years.\n\nThere is a trend to life-extend existing plants and PWRs are now often expected to run for more\nthan 40 years, compared to their design life of around 30 years. Life extension may require\nsignificant new expenditure to replace worn out equipment, in particular large components like\nsteam generators and vessel heads, and to bring the plants closer to current safety standards. The\nentire US reactor fleet was ordered in the years 1963-1973, a period difficult to compare with\ncurrent technological standards.\n\nDespite these costs, however, life extension in the USA appears, from a utility perspective, to be an\neconomically sound decision and is being widely pursued by utilities. Whether in practice this\nperception proves to be correct or whether high and perhaps prohibitive maintenance expenditures\nwill be necessary to keep the plants in a serviceable and licensable condition remains to be seen.\n\nIn terms of capital costs, extending a reactor’s life (PLEX) is far cheaper than constructing a new\npower plant. Some estimates say that the average cost of PLEX is as low as $10-50 per installed\nkW, compared to the gas power plant costs of around $400-500/kW. In one case, at Duke Power in\nthe USA, the utility estimates that the cost for obtaining an extended license to operate would be as\nlow as $4-6/kW\", Furthermore, by the end of a reactor’s operating life, the decommissioning\nfund should be fully stocked so another large part of the nuclear opcrating costs may be written off,\nas the utility will no longer need to put funds aside to pay for decommissioning.\n\nliL4. Implications for Existing and Future Reactors\n\nNuclear projects remain highly sensitive to construction cost, cost of capital and duration of\nconstruction, Industry efforts to gain support from government are likely to remain focused in the\nlatter two areas, through Joan guarantees and efforts to streamline licensing. Policy makers need to\ntake care that stepping in to ameliorate these conditions does not raise issues of accountability, and\ndoes not adversely affect the viability of competing power resources.\n\nPlant construction is likely to move forward first in regions with regulated utilities or governments\nwilling to absorb much or all of the risks of the construction. The handful of projects that have\nentered into actual construction illustrate that historic concerns regarding cost-competitiveness and\ndelays remain today. Cost estimates, while essential for some purposes and useful in delineating\ntrends remain a poor indicator of actual costs. They are also difficult to compare across time or\nspace in a consistent manner. Core government policies to shift long-term structural risks of\nnuclear energy, primarily accident liability and responsibility for waste management, away from\ninvestors remains an enabling factor essential for the viability of nuclear power.\n\nThe economic viability of nuclear power plants depends very much on the owner of the plant and\nthe conditions in which the owner operates. For a utility with a good credit rating in a traditional\nmonopoly electricity market and where the regulator is not aggressive in its objective of\nminimizing costs for consumers, utilities can, provided there is political consent for the plants,\ncontinue to build and operate plants as they wish. The only constraints on them are whether it is\nfeasible to borrow money to build new plants. For some developing countries, this constraint may\nbe sufficient to make orders non-viable. But for the countries that have sccn the vast majority of\norders in the past 25 years - Russia and Asian countries such as China, Japan, South Korea and\nIndia — energy market liberalization measures have had little impact yet in preventing utilities from\nplacing uneconomic orders or from keeping uneconomic reactors in operation. The trend to open\nelectricity systems to competition seems to have stalled outside Europe so it is likely that the\ncountries noted above will continue to place nuclear orders as long as there is political support for\nthese orders. The next section on the economic viability of existing plant, plants under construction\nand future orders therefore is not valid for these countries.\n\nApart from reactors in operation, those under construction and those yet to be ordered, there is a\nfourth group of reactors that needs to be considered separately. Partially-completed plants, on\n25° Nuclear Engineering International, “US Nuclear Power — Can Competition give it renewed Life?”, June\n1999.\n\nwhich work has been halted for some time, have seen proposals or actual construction restarts\ndriven by the rising value of electricity through the first half of 2008. Most of the plants falling into\nthis category are in the former Soviet Union (Ukraine) or the former Eastern Bloc (Bulgaria,\nRomania, and Slovakia) but there are also plants in Brazil, Argentina, and the United States that\nhave been stalled long-term.\n\n11.4.1. Existing reactors\n\nNearly all the reactors in operation, particularly those in the West, were completed more than 20\nyears ago. Partly due to the age of the capital, and partly due to a series of capital write-offs, the\nfixed costs are of much less importance to the existing fleet of reactors than for reactors under\nconstruction or yet to be ordered. If the owners of these operating reactors can continue to convince\nthe responsible regulators of the safety of these plants, the main issues are whether their operating\ncosts will remain low enough for them to be competitive and whether the cost of major\nexpenditures to replace worn out components or to upgrade safety is economically viable. Because\nof the rigidity of the cost structure — unlike fossil fuel plants, the majority of costs are incurred\nwhether or not the plant is operated — nuclear plants are vulnerable to factors such as fluctuations in\nfossil fuel prices and over-capacity in generation, which may lead to a fall in the wholesale\nelectricity price.\n\nAs has been clearly illustrated in the UK by the experience with Britain’s ageing AGRs, operating\ncosts can escalate at an alarming rate and since 2002, the average operating costs for Britain’s\nseven AGR stations and its single PWR have tripled. In 2002, low fossil fuel prices and a\ngenerating capacity surplus bankrupted the nuclear company, British Energy. So it can be seen that\nBritish Energy, which was rescued at a cost to taxpayers of more than £10bn, is only surviving\nbecause of the good luck of very high fossil fuel prices in the past 3-4 years. Fossil fuel prices have\nnow fallen significantly from their peak and the future of British Energy now looks precarious.\n\nUS plants are now having their operating licenses extended from 40 to 60 years’? and there is a\nwide perception that this will apply in other countries and will mean that plants will actually\noperate for this long. It remains to be seen how well the materials perform over this fifty percent\nlife extension. However, plants may also be retired before 60 years if repair and maintenance costs\nstart to rise steeply, and the plants are not competitive or, where markets are still regulated,\nregulators are not prepared to allow companies to pass on unjustifiable costs.”\n\nlll.4.2. Reactors under construction\n\nOnly two reactors of modern design are under construction in the West, Olkiluoto-3 and Flamanvill-\n3, Unless and until EDF loses its position of overwhelming dominance in the French market it must\nbe seen as a de facto monopoly and can pass on any additional costs from Flamanville to its\nconsumers.\n\nAs was noted above, Olkiluoto-3 has very particular arrangements that protect it from the market.\nThe economic risks of building this plant are borne by consumers, through the cost-plus terms of\nthe power purchase contract, French (and Swedish) taxpayers through the credit guarantees, and the\nvendor, AREVA NP (majority owned by the French public), through the turn-key contract.\nWhether the loan is economic to the banks is a moot point. So, far from surviving in the market\nthrough its competitiveness, the plant has been very fully and deliberately insulated from the\nmarket. Despite this, the severe construction problems mean that the possibility of a default of the\ncustomer can no longer be discounted. The Olkiluoto project is acknowledged to be nearly 60%\nover budget and at least three years Jate after only three and a half years of construction. The\nowners, TVO, expect to be covered for the cost escalation by the contract with the Franco-German\n2 As of April 2009, 52 or half of the operating US units had already received license extensions; additional\nones have applied.\n\n26! Ag chapter II illustrates, the average age of the 121 units that have already been shut down is only 22\nyears, In France, the operator EDF has not yet convinced the Nuclear Safety Authority that its reactors could\nsafely operate for 40 years or longer.\n\ncompany, AREVA NP, although whether this contract will stick is now far from clear. But most\nof the costs of late completion - buying the replacement power from a potentially tight Nordic\nwholesale electricity market - will fall on the owners.\n\nLittle new generation has been built since the Nordic market was created in the late 1990s and\nalready, dry winters, which reduce the availability of hydro-power have led to short-term large\nincreases (up to 6-fold) in the wholesale electricity price. So for the period 2009-12, when\nOlkiluoto-3 should have been producing 12TWh per year, the owners will have to buy that power\nfrom the wholesale market, assuming that amount of power is available. The economic studies on\nwhich Olkiluoto-3 were based assumed the generation cost would be €24/MWh. If the Nord Pool\nprice was three times that, far from unusual in recent years, the extra cost of purchasing this power\nfrom the market, over three years would be on the order €2bn.\n\n11.4.3. Reactors on which construction has stopped\n\nConstruction on a handful of reactors started in the 1980s but has been interrupted because of\npolitical or economic issues. These plants include Belene-1&2 (Bulgaria), Mochovce-3&4\n(Slovakia), Cernavoda-3 (Romania), plants in Ukraine, Angra dos Reis (Brazil) and Atucha\n(Argentina). Restart of work is frequently reported to have occurred or to be imminent. Often,\nhowever, these reports often turned out to be false, Generally the problem is finance, Completing\nthese plants may seem attractive to the owners who see the plants as cheap sources of power.\nOfficially the construction sites at Belene and Mochovee have been recently reactivated.\n\nHowever, experience with completing partially built plants on which work stopped for a significant\ntime is poor, for example, at Mochovce-1 &2, Rovno 4 and Khmelnitsky-2 (Ukraine) and Temelin-\n1&2 (Czech Republic). A particular concern is how much designs that may be more than 40 years\nold can be updated to meet current needs and requirements. Licensing procedures that provided the\nbasis for the authorization of the construction of these plants over 20 years ago certainly do not\nreflect current state of the art either. However, because these plants are generally in countries\nwhere electricity liberalization has not been important yet (Russia and Ukraine} or where the\ngeneration market is not very competitive (Brazil), they may be able to obtain financing. Where\ncompetitive markets are on the horizon, obtaining finance will likely be much more difficult,\npreventing these plants being completed.\n\n11.4.4. Future orders\n\nThe key elements for new orders to be placed are how well costs can be minimized and controlled;\nand how extensively the new reactors can be protected from the electricity wholesale market in\ncase costs begin to rise.\n\nProtection from the market\n\nIn the USA, nearly 30 separate subsidy programs are available to new reactors. In total, subsidics to\nnew reactors in the USA are likely to exceed the private capital put at risk. In Europe, there are\ndiscussions about putting guarantees on the carbon price that nuclear plants would receive in the\nEuropean Union emissions trading scheme — of course, if the price was guaranteed, it would not be\na market.\n\nControlling costs\n\nLoan guarantees are the most likely form of cost control that will be sought. These reduce finance\ncosts by protecting the banks and vendors from default. Of equal importance, the guarantees enable\nplant owners to load up on far more debt than would otherwise be possible, brining down financing\ncosts significantly.\n\nThe protection for utilities from the credit guarantees may not be complete, however. The credit\nrating of the utility may still suffer if a nuclear order is placed, as was illustrated by Eskom (South\n26 Nucleonics Week, “Target date for operating Olkiluoto-3 again delayed, this time until 2012”,\n\n23 October 2008.\n\nAfrica). Turnkey contracts would also be of great value but experience at Olkiluoto suggests they\nrepresent a risk the vendors cannot take. A turnkey contract may not offer protection against\nconstruction delays and the cost of ‘replacement power’ to replace the power the new plant was\nexpected to provide may exceed the value of cost over-runs. Performance guarantees, such as are\noffered for combined cycle plants would also be usefull but are highly unlikely to be offered due to\nthe greater uncertainty on nuclear plant delivery times and cost.\nThe British government seems likely to offer companies building new nuclear plants a price for\nwaste disposal that would be fixed on the day construction starts.\"* Although waste disposal costs\nare a relatively small element of the total cost of energy and these costs are not generally incurred\nfor several decades, the guarantee is still useful to utilities in reducing long-tail risks to investors.\nHowever, the guarantee will carry little weight in discounted cash flow project appraisals.\nIt still remains to be seen whether in the USA and the UK, a package of measures can be\nestablished that offer enough assurance for utilities to build new nuclear plants but do not expose\ntaxpayers and electricity consumers to a level of economic risk that is unacceptable. The politics of\nthe decisions suggest that many of the incentives on offer to spur nuclear plant construction will\nresult merely in shifting risks from investors to taxpayers, customers, or the population surrounding\nplants.\nHIL5. Nuclear Liability Issues\nThe nuclear liability and compensation arrangements currently in place are seriously inadequate.\nThis has major negative implications for reactor safety, fails to ensure compensation of damage in\nthe event of an accident, and creates distortion of competition in the electricity market.\nThere is a need to introduce new liability and compensation arrangements that reflect the actual\npotential costs of nuclear accidents, that would fully compensate damage caused in the event of a\nnuclear accident, and which would eliminate a significant subsidy to nuclear electricity generation.\nYet attempts to significantly increase the minimum compensation required by international nuclear\nliability treaties by even a relatively modest amount have been efficiently resisted by the nuclear\nindustry.\nThere are two basic international legal frameworks contributing to an international regime on\nnuclear liability: The IAEA’s 1963 Convention on Civil Liability for Nuclear Damage (Vienna\nConvention) and the OECD’s 1960 Convention on Third Party Liability in the Field of Nuclear\nEnergy (Paris Convention), and the associated ‘Brussels Supplementary Convention” of 1963.\nThe Vienna and Paris liability conventions are also linked by a Joint Protocol adopted in 1988.26\nThe Vienna and Paris Conventions had two primary goals: first, to create an economic environment\nwhere the nuclear industry could flourish; and, second, to ensure that clear procedures and some\ncompensation would be available in the event of an accident. The first aim would be achieved by\nremoving legal and financial uncertainties over potentially enormous liability claims that could\narise in the event of an accident. From the industry’s development, it was clear that nuclear power\ncould only be exploited as an efficient and independent source of energy if a reasonable amount of\nfinancial protection were available for private investors who were placing their financial resources\nin an unknown and potentially high-risk sector.\nWhile there are some differences in detail, the Vienna and Paris Conventions have some important\nfeatures in common. In particular they:\n\n+ Allow limitations to be placed on the amount, duration and types of damage for which\n\nnuclear operators are liable;\n\n263 Department of Business, Enterprise and Regulatory Reform (BERR), Press release, “Clean up fund is\nprecondition for new nuclear — Hutton”, 22 February 2008;\nhittp://www.nce.co.uk/clean-up-fund-is-precondition-for-new-nuclear-hutton/766426.article\n* Convention Supplementary to the Paris Convention of 29\" July 1960 on Third Party Liability in the Field\nof Nuclear Energy.\n265 The Joint Protocol Relating to the Application of the Vienna Convention and the Paris Convention,\nSeptember 1988. The Joint Protocol entered into force on 27 April 1992.\n\n* Require insurance or other surety to be obtained by the operator;\n\n* Channel liability exclusively to the operator of the nuclear installation;\n\n¢ Impose strict liability on the nuclear operator, regardless of fault, but subject to exceptions;\n\n* Grant exclusive jurisdiction to the courts of one country for any given incident, normally\n\nthe country in whose territory the incident occurs.\n\nThe Chernobyl accident clearly revealed a number of deficiencies in the regimes. Compared with\nthe damage caused by Chernobyl, it was obvious that the liability amounts were woefully low and\nmany countries were not party to either Convention. In addition, not all of the damage — including\nsome of the most serious damage - caused by Chernobyl was covered by the definition of damage\napplicable under either Convention. There were also problems with the periods of time during\nwhich claims for compensation could be brought, the claims procedures, and the limitations on\nwhich courts had jurisdiction to hear claims.\nThe 1988 Joint Protocol” was developed as an interim step intended primarily to address the lack\nof membership in the IAEA and OECD liability regimes. The Joint Protocol creates a ‘bridge’\nbetween the two conventions, effectively expanding their geographical scope. However, the\ninternational community soon recognized that more fundamental reform was needed in order to\nattract broader adherence to the international nuclear liability conventions and to make them really\neffective. Work began on amendments to the Vienna Convention in 1990, followed later by\nrevisions to the Paris Convention for the Brussels Supplementary Convention, Amending protocols\nto the Vienna, Paris and Brussels Conventions have been adopted,” as has the 1997 Convention\non Supplementary Compensation (CSC) - a new instrument intended to establish a global regime of\nliability and compensation.\nThe revisions to the Vienna and Paris/Brussels Conventions do introduce a number of\nimprovements. The liability and compensation amounts would be higher than before, with operator\nliability under the revised Paris Convention required to be at least €700 million and the total\ncompensation available under the revised Brussels Supplementary Convention €1500 million.\nNonetheless, the overall amounts remain worryingly low when compared with the costs of the\nChernoby] accident, currently estimated to be in the order of hundreds of billions of Euros. Further,\nsetting fixed compensation sums is not only arbitrary (in the absence of genuinely robust estimates\nof probable damage) but it is also unlikely to be valid over the longer term (unless they can be\ncontinually adjusted to take into account changes in the economic profile of accident\nconsequences). Finally, even at the low levels covered under the Conventions, there are concerns\nabout the strength of the guarantor parties and their ability or willingness to make good on financial\npledges in a timely manner.\nAlthough there are unifying features, the nuclear liability conventions do not provide one\ncomprehensive and unified international legal regime for nuclear accidents. Furthermore, the goal\nto ensure broad participation in the new regimes has not been achieved. Less than half the world’s\nnuclear reactors are covered by any of the existing international agreements.” At this point, only\nfive countries have ratified the 1997 Vienna Convention. This was cnough to bring the Protocol to\namend the Vienna Convention into force in 2003, but the lack of wide adherence remains\nproblematic.\nThere has also been a delay in the ratification of the revised Paris Convention and the revised\nBrussels Supplementary Convention. In order for the Protocol amending the Paris Convention to\nenter into force it must be ratified by two-thirds of the Contracting Parties, For EU Member States,\nthis was supposed to have taken place by the end of 2006, but this still has not yet been done. For\nthe Protocol amending the Brussels Convention, ratification by al? Contracting Parties is required.\n266 The Joint Protocol entered into force in April 1992.\n267 The 1997 Protocol to Amend the 1963 Vienna Convention; the 2004 Protocol to Amend the 1960 Paris\nConvention; and the 2004 Protocol to amend the 1963 Brussels Supplementary Supplementary Convention.\n268 McRae has calculated that the nuclear power generating countries that operate outside the international\ncompensation regimes account for more than half of worldwide installed capacity. Sec: Ben McRae,\n“Overview of the Convention on Supplementary Compensation\", in; Reform of Civil Nuclear Liability,\nOECD, 2000, p.175.\n\nFour countries have ratified the new Supplementary Compensation Convention, below the\nminimum needed for this to take effect.\nTable 6: Summary of Liability and Compensation Amounts for Different Conventions\n(all figures rounded, in millions of euros)\nConvention Operator Liability Total Combined Total Compensation\n+ Installation State Contributions from Available\nOther States Party\n| Paris, 1960 [| —estogig | TR toes\n|__Paris, 2004 | Atleaste7oo_ | | At least €700\n[Vienna 1963 [es\n| Vienna,1997_ | Uptoeas7 | Te\n*Convention on Supplementary Compensation\nThe United States has been covered by an entirely separate liability regime, the Price-Anderson\nAct, for the past fifty years (see section III.6.2.3 for more discussion). Like the Brussels and Paris\nConventions, it establishes a minimum level of coverage for third party damages that each reactor\nowner must procure insurance for. It adds an additional, much larger, layer of coverage through\nretrospective payments by all reactors in the case of a large accident. While the pool is the largest\nin the world, it remains inadequate. On a present value basis, even storm events in the USA\nregularly result in higher levels of damage.\nThe capacity of the private nuclear insurance market is also a major factor in determining whether\nnuclear operators can obtain the necessary coverage to meet the amount and extent of their liability\nunder the conventions. During the negotiations to revise the Vienna and Paris Conventions,\nrepresentatives of the nuclear insurance industry stated that some of the proposed amendments\nwould be problematic” In particular, the nuclear insurance industry was concerned that there was:\n¢ Insufficient private insurance market capacity to insure nuclear operators against raised\nliability amounts;\n+ An unwillingness of the market to extend the period after which the operator would no\nlonger be liable;\n¢ A difficulty in that private insurance could not cover all the categories included in the\nexpanded definition of damage.\nIt remains unclear whether nuclear operators will be able to obtain private insurance coverage to\ncover their full liabilities under the revised Conventions. The gap between the liability risks the\noperators are required to assume under the revised convention and the coverage currently available\nfrom private insurers, is causing problems and delaying ratification of the revised liability\nconventions.\nAnother problem has to do with the new perception of the possibilities of terror attacks against\nnuclear installations. Under the Vienna Convention (both the original Convention and as amended\nin 1997) and the original Paris Convention, the operator of a nuclear installation is liable for\ndamage due to acts of terrorism, After the events of September 11\" 2001, the insurers reappraised\nthe risks associated with acts of terror, concluding that the probability of a nuclear reactor\nbecoming the target of such an attack was significantly higher than had been previously thought.\nSome insurers may be able to limit their coverage to operators for damage caused by a nuclear\nincident resulting from a terrorist act — requiring state intervention to insure this risk.\n26 Thidem, p. 9. The nuclear insurance industry made its concems known at an carly stage in the discussion\nof amendments of the Paris Convention. See \"Letter of the Comité Européen des Assurances”, 8 December\n2000.\n\nThe problem with private insurance can be seen to be - at least partly - a financial question. It is not\nthat insurance is unavailable, it is just that \"few [policies] can be purchased at reasonable cost or at\nleast at costs that are competitive”.”” The UK Government has recognized that the increase in the\nliability amount and the cost of insurance for UK nuclear operators (present ones and any future\nones), may mean that commercial cover cannot be secured for all aspects of the new operator\nliabilities. It will explore the alternative options available — including the possibility of providing\ncover from public funds, 7”!\nHowever, it is also — at least partly - a political decision. Simply because the private insurance\nindustry is not able or willing to make cover available at the appropriate price to the industry, does\nnot mean that the risks are not there.\nFrom the perspective of potential victims there is a pressing need to ensure full and effective\ncompensation for the full risks of nuclear accidents, and it is less of an issue what the specific\nmodalities are. In accordance with the conventions, gaps in insurance coverage have to be covered\nby the operator to the extent that insurance or other financial security is not available or is\ninsufficient to satisfy claims. From the perspective of the efficient functioning of the energy\nmarkets (for example, avoiding subsidies to nuclear power by failing to internalize the full costs of\nnuclear generation), whatever modalities are chosen must be reflected in the price of electricity\nfrom nuclear generation.\nlL6. The Subsidy Issue\nThe problem is, of course, first, a new nuclear project is vastly expensive.\nWe estimate two 1,500-megawatt units to cost on the order of $12 billion\nin today’s numbers. I represent the biggest company in my industry, and\nthat’s bigger than my balance sheet. So we can’t do it without the federal\nsubsidy.\nJohn Rowe\nCEO, Exelon Corporation\nApril 20097”\nIIl.6.1. Overview of subsidies to nuclear energy\nIn country after country, long frozen nuclear construction plans have been thawing. New plant\nannouncements have been arriving with increasing frequency, and even countries such as Germany\nand Sweden that had foresworn their civilian nuclear sector have reopened debate*™. The impetus\nfor this shift has been twofold: the idea that nuclear power could bolster energy independence from\nunstable oil and gas producers; and most importantly claims that nuclear energy is the only large\nscale resource to provide energy without carbon. Without nuclear, the story goes, we will not be\nable to meet the twin challenges of preventing climate change while maintaining and further\nimproving our quality of life.\nLess visible than the pronouncements about our new nuclear commonweal, though always present\nin the background, has been a growing array of government programs to bolster, support, and\nsubsidize these reactors. The subsidy programs are normally framed as ‘temporary’ and\n‘transitional’ — needed just long enough to move the industry up the learning curve of a new reactor\n2° Tn Europe there are two mutual insurance arrangements, which supplement commercial insurance pools’\ncover for operators of nuclear plants. The European Mutual Assurance for the Nuclear Industry (EMAND.\nwas founded in 1978 and European Liability Insurance for the Nuclear Industry (BLIND) created in 2002.\nELINI plans to make €100m available as third party cover, and its 28 members had contributed half that as of\nlate 2007 for a special capital fund. ELINI's members comprise most EU nuclear plant operators, EMANI's\nfunds are also only about €500m. See UIC 2007: Civil Liability for Nuclear Damage, Uranium Information\nCentre, Issues Briefing Paper # 70, October 2007; http:/Avww.uic.com.au/nip70.htm,\n27. UMG, “The Role of Nuclear Power\", Consultation 2007.\n2? Panel Discussion, “Toward a Nuclear Power Renaissance? Fact or Fiction”, 2009 Carnegie Endowment\nfor International Peace International Non-Prolifcration Conference, Washington, DC, 6 April 2009.\n23 However, it remains very unlikely that the ‘debates’ will lead to any policy shift in practice in the short\nand medium term.\n\ntype and a new set of regulatory oversight. Yet the reality is that nuclear power has already\nbenefitted from more than a half-century of subsidies. A 1954 advertisement from the General\nElectric civilian reactor program notes this clearly:\nWe already know the kinds of plants, which will be feasible, how they will operate,\nand we can estimate what their expenses will be. In five years — certainly within 10—a\nnumber of them will be operating at about the same cost as those using coal. They will\nbe privately financed, built without government subsidy.\nThe ad copy could have been written today.\nIt is certainly true that nuclear power can provide large scale, baseload energy resources with low\ndirect carbon emissions. But just like all energy resources, its strengths are counterbalanced by a\nnumber of weaknesses. These include extremely high capital costs, long construction times,\ninability to follow load patterns, and a variety of safety and security challenges from highly\nradioactive waste storage to serving as cover for weapons proliferation. Some of these problems are\nunique to nuclear power, and quite difficult to address. But absent in the push for big new handouts\nfor nuclear reactors is the basic idea on which markets normally operate — that the full cost of\nnuclear power, including private investment plus the public subsidy — should be more cost effective\nand lower risk than other ways to meet the same energy security and climate change challenges.\nWhile cven the private cost clement of this picture is uncertain and continues to escalate, the public\nsubsidy portion is generally missing entirely. Without it, nuclear as a solution cannot be properly\ncompared to alternative solutions; nor can the potentially enormous cost to taxpayers be\nappropriately vetted.\nThere are actually two important costs to evaluate. There are financial costs, to be sure ~ costs that\nare likely to run into the many hundreds of billions of dollars worldwide. But the nuclear new build\noption entails very significant opportunity costs as well. No society has enough money to bankroll\nevery technology. Investing a large share of available resources in subsidizing nuclear energy\nmeans that those funds are not around for other options.\nIt is important to evaluate what we get and what we are giving up by this course of action. Consider\nclimate change. In a best-case scenario, large investments in nuclear buy greenhouse gas reductions\nthat start in seven to 15 years. The net gains may be still further forward given that some new\nfacilities are needed simply to offset the closure of aging plants. We give up smaller scale, more\nrapid mitigation approaches. And when these new reactors do come on line, we add large base-load\nplants with mostly public capital at risk. If they default, they will continue in service churning\nelectricity at their very low marginal cost of production (the taxpayer having eaten the capital\ncosts), freezing out energy efficiency and an array of alternative energy sources that may be less\nexpensive overall, albeit with higher variable costs.\nThis chapter explores some common forms of subsidies around the world, followed by more\nspecific examples of subsidies from the USA and the UK. These countries are included primarily\ndue to a greater availability of information, not because they are the only nations subsidizing\nnuclear. To the contrary, subsidics to nuclear power are endemic throughout the world. In countrics\nwith limited budget transparency and government ownership of reactors and fuel chain facilities,\nthere is simply less data available. One interesting aspect of the newest wave of reactor\nconstruction is how international they are becoming, both in terms of owners and major suppliers,\nand equally in the number of countries providing subsidies. Going forward, looking singly at home\ncountry subsidies may not be enough.\nII.6.2. Common forms of support around the world\nWhile there is some cross-country variation in nuclear subsidies, many of the measures are actually\ncommon throughout most of the world (see Table 7), These include subsidized access to credit;\nsubsidies to capital equipment; below-cost provision of enrichment and regulatory oversight\nservices; caps on liability resulting from an accident or attack; and socialization of costs and\ndelivery risks associated with managing nuclear waste. Some countrics make inadequate provision\nfor other known end-of-life activities such as plant decommissioning. A few emerging subsidy\n\nschemes are also present in multiple countries. These include expanding purchase mandates for\n\"green\" energy to include nuclear and windfall grants of carbon credits at the inception of national\ncarbon trading schemes.\nTable 7: Common Subsidies to Nuclear Power Around the World\n| Subsidies to CapitalCosts |\nSubsidized access to credit Policies dramatically reduce nuclear’s cost of capital by\n-Direct government loans * « 5\nenabling them to obtain debt at the government’s cost of\n~Government guaranteed loans borrowing; and to use high levels of this inexpensive debt\n-Direct government investment in nuclear- ommowing; and’ to Use Nigh leve .

Capital subsidies\nGovernment programs to subsidize the cost of capital are probably the most common form of\npublic subsidy, as well as the largest source of subsidy to the nuclear sector around the world.\nThese programs include loan guarantees and rate-basing of in-process plants that reduce the cost of\n\nfunds; as well as accelerated write-offs of plant and equipment and tax credits that help to reduce\nthe effective cost of capital goods.\nCapital subsidies either reduce the cost of funds or reduce the after-tax cost of capital equipment\nitself. Nuclear power is considered a high investment risk. Without subsidies, plant developers\nwould be required to pay high-risk premiums to capital providers, both in the form of higher\ninterest rates and higher returns on equity. They would also need to adopt a more resilient, though\nmuch higher cost, capital structure that is more heavily weighted to equity.\nThe introduction of loan guarantees dramatically reduces the cost of capital to plants in two ways.\nFirst, a government guarantee means lenders don't care how risky the nuclear plant itself is, since\nthe financial strength of the guarantor drives their ultimate risk exposure. Thus, they are willing to\nlend funds based on the security of the guarantor. With large, national governments as guarantors,\nthe previously high-risk debt becomes almost risk-free, and interest rates drop sharply. Second, the\nguarantee enables plant owners to use much more of this inexpensive debt to finance the plant — up\nto 80% in the case of the United States. This shift in capital structure is of great financial benefit to\nthe firms. As noted by the Keystone Center in its 2007 report, “even very strong non-utility\ngenerators building plants in competitive wholesale markets now need 65% to 70% equity to access\nthe bond market”.’” This implies a maximum debt level of only 30-35% - a value that has likely\nbeen scaled back even further since the credit market meltdown in late 2008.\nThe combination of lower risk debt and the ability to use much more of it greatly reduces the cost\nof financing a new nuclear plant, and with it the price of the resultant power. A recent evaluation\nby the US Congressional Research Service indicated that loan guarantees alone reduced the\nlevelized costs of nuclear power by 20%.\" Estimates by the private sector show even larger\nbenefits. UniStar Nuclear Energy, a joint venture between Constellation Energy and EDF that\nhopes to build a series of reactors across the USA, estimates the loan guarantees will reduce their\nlevelized costs by neatly 40%\"\nCredit support is a common feature of most nuclear deals. The ongoing AREVA reactor project in\nOlkiluoto, Finland, for example, has received very low cost loans from government entities totaling\n€1.95 billion, and export credit assistance from both France (€610 million) and Sweden\n(€110 million) (see section IIL3.1.4.). Japan has set up a specialized finance vehicle, the Japan\nFinance Corp, to provide credit guarantees on nuclear-related sales to developed countries.2”\nEfforts to move credit subsidies beyond developed economies and into the developing world are\ntaking shape as well, irrespective of the complexity that proper oversight of a nuclear sector may\npose for some of these governments. For example, Japan is considering a package \"of soft loans\nfrom the Japan Bank for International Cooperation or insurance by Nippon Export and Investment\nInsurance, a state-sponsored export credit agency\" to finance a reactor deal in Vietnam.”\nSome of the larger multilateral development banks have implicit or explicit restrictions against\nlending to nuclear projects. Yet, these institutions form one of the larger pools of capital for\ninvesting in the developing world. The USA, France, and Japan are working on modifications to\nexport credit terms in general so they are more attractive for nuclear projects. They have supported\na study of the cost-effectiveness of nuclear power within the World Bank, and have pushed for an\nextension of the repayment period term for Export Credit Agency (ECA) nuclear support from\n15 years (already three years longer than for other plants) to 30 years. Another change under\nconsideration is greater flexibility to apply credit support to components supplied by a variety of\ncountries (rather than just the one supporting a specific ECA)?” If these shifts go through, a global\n2 The Keystone Center, “Nuclear Power Joint Fact-Finding”, Keystone Center, Keystone, 2007, p.43.\n275 Stan Kaplan, “Power Plants: Characteristics and Costs, US Congressional Research Service”,\n13 November 2008, RL34746.\n276 Joe Turnage, \"New Nuclear Development: Part of the Strategy for a Lower Carbon Energy Future\",\npresentation at the International Trade Administration Nuclear Energy Summit, 8 October 2008.\n\nNucleonics Week, 25 September 2008.\n78 Kwok, 20 March 2009.\n275Daniel Horner and Ann MacLachlan, \"US working with allies to change global rules on nuclear\nfinancing”, Platts, 23 October 2008.\n\npool of government-subsidized credit will be able to be deployed to build reactor projects\nthroughout the world.\nJIL.6.2.2. Public spending on nuclear-related research and development (R&D)\nGovernments around the world have long supported nuclear power through substantial investments\nof public money into research and development related to the nuclear fuel chain. Between 1974\n(when the International Energy Agency began collecting data on energy R&D) and 2007, nuclear\ncaptured nearly 55% of all public research dollars, equivalent to more than $236 billion (2007$) in\nsupport. This is more than six times the level of support to renewable energy — despite the fact that\nrenewables actually comprise a fairly wide range of different technologies.\nRecent years have seen some shift in support, with a smaller take for nuclear and a somewhat larger\ninvestment in efficiency, hydrogen, and renewables. Nonetheless, even after the adjustment,\nnuclear remains by far the largest beneficiary of government R&D funding, at more than 40% of\ntotal support. At the country level, R&D investments into nuclear have gone down as a share of\nenergy R&D even in nuclear-focused countries such as France and Japan. Nonetheless, even after\nthe decline, the technology captures 73% and 67% of total energy R&D spending respectively in\nthose countries.\nTable 8: Government Funded Energy R&D within IEA Countries (in millions of US$2907)\n1974-2007 1998-2007\n% %\nCumulative share | Cumulative share\nGroup 1: Energy Efficiency 38,442 8.9% 14,893 14.2%\nGroup II: Fossil Fuels 55,027 12.8% 11,114 10.6%\nGroup III: Renewable Energy Sources 37,333 8.7% 10,709 10.2%\n[Group TV: Nuclear Fission and Fusion, 236,328 54.8% 43,667.

Capping or shifting accident liability off of operator\nAccident risks have been the Achilles heal of the nuclear industry since its inception. For most\nindustries, even a large accident, while catastrophic to the immediately surrounding area, tends to\nbe relatively well-contained geographically. The presence of high-level radioactive materials and.\nwastes at nuclear facilities creates a different set of risks for the surrounding population, including\nthe potential of rendering fairly large areas uninhabitable for decades or more.\nIn developed countries with good regulatory oversight, the risk of accident is deemed quite low.\nNonetheless, the potential health and property damages of any medium size reactor accident could.\nbe enormous. The industry also faces systemic risks, noted by the Keystone Center analysis that\n\n\"Chemobyl's impact in slowing nuclear construction world-wide illustrates how reactor accidents\nanywhere can affect nuclear fleets everywhere.”*\n\nThe scale of potential losses made commercial insurers steer clear of underwriting nuclear accident\nrisks at the inception of the industry. Government intervention came early -- with the Price\nAnderson Act passed in the United States in 1957, and renewed ever since. This law set a\nmaximum cap on liability for damages to people or property offsite from a nuclear accident. The\nlevel of this cap, even in the USA, is lower than insured damages often exceeded in storm events.\nThus, the statutory cap on required insurance provides a subsidy, in the form of reduced premium\ncosts, to nuclear operators. A similar situation exists in every country in the world with nuclear\nreactors. Subsidy magnitude is affected by a variety of factors, such as how low the cap is relative\nto likely damages in a major accident; how likely and quickly the covered amounts will be paid\nafter an accident; whether the covered amounts are provided by the nuclear operator or directly or\nindirectly by a government entity, and whether there are risks associated with the fuel chain that are\nnot covered at all by the various liability conventions.\n\nThere is tremendous variation across countries in the amount and quality of coverage available.\nUnder the US system, the federal cap protects not only reactor owners, but contractors,\ntransporters, and fuel chain operations as well. The US system has a primary tier of direct insurance\nprovided by the operator; and a much larger second tier of ‘retrospective’ premiums collected from\nevery reactor after an accident at any reactor that exceeds the primary coverage level. The total\npool of coverage - the largest in the world - amounts to over $10 billion in nominal payments.\nHowever, much of the funding occurs over a six-year period, reducing the pool on a more\nappropriate present value basis to roughly $7.7 billion?\"\n\nWith the exception of Germany, pooling is not used in other countries. Rather, a combination of\noperator and sovercign guarantccs and insurance exist under a patchwork of intcrnational\nconventions and national laws. (see section III.5 for details). The specific conventions covering a\nparticular nuclear nation vary widely. The caps under most of the conventions provide less than\n$500 million in aggregate coverage, with operator liability often lower. No liability regime now in\neffect outside the USA provides more than $2 billion in aggregate cover, despite the large\npopulations and high valued real estate surrounding many of these plants.\n\nII1.6.2.4, Nationalization of waste management and site remediation risks\n\nNuclear power generates wastes that must be managed or safeguarded for hundreds or thousands of\nyears. This creates a severe long-term liability risk for private firms - a risk that does not exist with\nother energy resources. Aside from liability exposure, there are also very significant technical\nchallenges regarding the best way to store the wastes safely. Not surprisingly, these factors\ncombined bring with them quite large financial risks.\n\nNational governments have stepped in with programs that effectively nationalize both the financial\nand liability risks of waste management. It is unlikely that the commercial industry could have\ndeveloped at all without these programs. Nationalized waste management efforts have been\nsupplemented with government responsibility for contaminated fuel chain sites such as uranium\nmines, enrichment and reprocessing facilities, even when the enterprises have been privatized.\n\n2 The Keystone Center, “Nuclear Power Joint Fact-Finding”, Keystone Center, Keystone, 2007, p.58.\n\n28!

Shifting of bad debts, uneconomic facilitics away from investors onto\ntaxpayers or ratepayers.\nIn a competitive market, if costs of nuclear power, including debt service, rose too high, investors\nwould lose money and plants might close. Historically, nuclear power has operated in a regulated\nenvironment. Above-market costs were shifted to ratepayers via higher power tariffs; or through\nplant cancellations, for which ratepayers remained liable. As markets were deregulated, these costs\nwere packaged in other ways — ‘stranded cost’ surcharges in the United States. A ‘fossil fuel levy’\n(FFL) was added to fossil plants in the United Kingdom in an effort to keep nuclear competitive.\nThe sums were sizeable: the FFL was about 10% of all electricity bills, worth roughly £1 billion\nper year. Nuclear-related surcharges, write-offs, and stranded cost allocations (discussed below)\nwere hundreds of billions of US dollars.\nEfforts to recreate the regulatory conditions that protected nuclear investors twenty years ago are\nonce again resurgent. Loan guarantees support this outcome, as do a growing number of US states\nthat are allowing nuclear investors to collect from ratepayers while construction is still in process,\nand even if a plant is abandoned prior to completion.”*.\nII.6.3. Subsidies to existing reactors in the USA\nThe types of subsidies to nuclear noted internationally have also been present within the United\nStates. Government research and development support has existed for well over a half-century,\nspanning all elements of reactor design and the fuel chain. Between 1950 and 1989, for example,\nnuclear fission captured 49% of total government R&D spending; nuclear fusion another 13%.”\nWhile the industry focuses on low operating costs it is casy to forget that even the existing reactor\nfleet required an immense amount of capital to construct, and that without capital subsidies, those\n282 Joe Turnage, \"New Nuclear Development: Part of the Strategy for a Lower Carbon Energy Future\",\npresentation at the International Trade Administration Nuclear Energy Summit, 8 October 2008.\n*83 Doug Koplow, “Federal Energy Subsidies: Energy, Environmental, and Fiscal Impacts, Technical\nAppendix”, Washington, DC: Alliance to Save Energy, 1993.\n\nplants would not have been built. The most important historical subsidies were investment tax\ncredits and special treatment of construction work in progress (CWIP). Investment tax credits allow\na portion of capital spending to reduce taxes owed. On interest expensing and CWIP, plant\ndevelopers were allowed to begin recovering interest and capital expenses on new construction\nwell before the plant was completed. In effect, these rules coerce existing ratepayers into providing\nlow cost financing to a plant that they might not ultimately even use; or that might not even be\ncompleted.\n\nThe costs of these write-offs were sizeable: more than $200 billion in cost overruns (2006 dollars)\nwere paid by ratepayers, plus an additional $225 billion in \"overcharges\" to utility customers once\nthe plants came online. An additional $50 billion (in today’s dollars) were abandoned prior to\ncompletion, of which ratepayers and taxpayers bore a significant portion of the costs.”**, Another\nwave of high-cost nuclear assets became visible as the US electricity market was deregulated, and\nevery power plant had to find buyers for power at a market price. This led to ‘stranded cost’ deals,\nin which the portion of power plant capital that could not be recovered at competitive rates was\nseparated from the plant, and treated as a separate liability to be recovered from all ratepayers.\nNuclear-related stranded costs approached $100 billion in today's dollars as well.”*°\n\nThe existing reactors in the United States have also benefitted from a number of other subsidy\nprograms. For example, all continue to benefit from caps on reactor accident liability; and\nnationalization of nuclear waste management in return for a small fee. They also received\nsubsidized uranium enrichment services from the federal uranium enrichment enterprise, prior to its\nprivatization in 1998. Finally, while US reactors do have segregated trust funds to cover post-\noperational closure and decommissioning of reactor sites (a better arrangement than in many other\ncountries), these funds receive some favorable tax treatment through reduced tax rates on\ninvestment carnings. In addition, should there turn out to be shortfalls in accrued funds, it is likely\nthat the original firm would no longer exist, and that they would become a taxpayer liability.\nAlthough there is no comprehensive record of historical subsidies to nuclear power since inception,\na review of a number of studies that have been done over the years demonstrates government's\ncentral role in the sector's market viability. Table 10 illustrates that subsidies were generally equal\nto one-third or more of the value of the power produced.”* While such levels of support may not be\nsurprising for very new industries with little installed base, to see subsidy levels so high over the\ncourse of four decades is quite striking. The subsidies undoubtedly served as a competitive barrier\nto other energy resources,\n\n284 David Schlissel, Michael Mullett, and Robert Alvarez, “Nuclear Loan Guarantees: Another Taxpayer\nBailout Ahead?”, Union of Concerned Scientists, March 2009.\n\n285 Christopher Seiple, \"Stranded Investment: The Other Side of the Story,” Public Utilities Fortnightly,\n\n15 March 1997.\n\n°° Th fact, the actual subsidies were probably even higher because many of the studies did not do a full tally\nof all subsidies in effect at the time. In addition, the value of produced power in the earlier comparisons is\noverstated due to data limitations at the industrial retail rate, rather than the wholesale rates that would\nprovide a more accurate metric of competitiveness.\n\nTable 10: Subsidizing Plant Construction and Operation (in US$2997)\nFederal ‘Average\nSubsidy Subsidy Subsidy as %\nPeriod of in billion in of Industrial\nAnalysis USS cents/kWh Price Analysis Notes\nKoplow/Barth Track Share of national\n2008 5.0 | 83 113-189% calculations - subsidies | average wholesale\nto anew reactor tates, 2002-06\nGoldberg/Renewable | Effect of Price-\n1947-99 | 178.0 15 NA Energy Portfolio Anderson Act not\nProject (2000)287 estimated,\nEffect of Price-\n1968-90 | 122.3 23 33% Komanoff/Greenpeace | ‘7 derson Act not\n(1992288 \\\nestimated.\nKomanoff/Greenpeace\nma fel fs) |\nKoplow/Alliance to\n“ Scumewco | |\nHeede, Morgan, .\npore \" Effect of Price-\n1985 | 26.8 70 83% Ridley/Center for Anderson Act not\nRenewable Resources ri .\n1935)291 estimated,\nChapman et al. /US Tax expenditures\n9\n1981 |-[-| 5.9 | 12.3 105% EPA (1981) only.\nBowring ed Tax and credit\n1950-79 41 NA att subsidies not\nAdministration estimated\n1980)293 .\n\nSource: Koplow, 200°\"\n1.6.3.1. Subsidies to new-build reactors in the USA: Case Study of Calvert Cliffs-3\nCalvert Cliffs-3 is a proposed new reactor to be co-located in Lusby, Maryland, with two existing\nreactors. The plant will be owned by UniStar Nuclear Energy (UNE), a joint venture between\nConstellation Energy, a large US utility, and EDF, a French utility mostly owned by the French\ngovernment.

Questioning before the California Energy\nCommission in June of 2007 is a good example:\nAssociate Member Geesman: \"And just to revisit the cap[ital] question again. Your\nbusiness model is premised on receiving the federal loan guarantee for each of your\nfour projects. Is that correct?\"\nDr. Turnage: \"That is correct.\"\nCalvert Cliffs-3 will benefit from many subsidies implemented at the federal and even the county\nlevel to support new reactor construction. Constellation presentations on the venture over the past\ncouple of years provide insights into how they estimate the subsidy value. However, additional\nadjustments are needed because the baseline costs for their models actually include some\nembedded subsidies as well.\nFederal Ioan guarantees. As discussed above, loan guarantees are tremendously valuable to new\nnuclear reactors. UniStar is on a ‘short-list’ for accessing a pool of US federal guarantees of\n$18.5 billion.\nAbsent federal intervention, the risk profile of new plants suggest that debt providers would require\na high share of equity in the plant. They would also require returns on both debt and equity that\nwould be too high for the energy produced to compete in the marketplace.\nThe ability to get inexpensive debt, to finance most of the project with it, and to keep that debt for\nup to 30 years, generates significant subsidies to UniStar. Their own cost estimates peg the value of\nthe guarantee at 3.7 cents per kWh on a levelized cost basis, a cost reduction of nearly 40%.7°°\nBased on their assumptions on operating factors and reactor size, this translates to nearly $500\nmillion per year in savings per reactor. The authorizing statute allows the guarantees to stay out for\na maximum of 30 years — which a rational owner will do since the cost of funds is so low. This\ntranslates to a public investment of nearly $13 billion to a single nuclear reactor, an astonishing\namount of public support for a single private facility.\nProduction Tax Credits. The Energy Policy Act of 2005 introduced a 1.8 cent per kWh\nproduction tax credit (PTC) for new nuclear power plants. The nuclear PTC is capped at $125\nmillion for a single plant and for a maximum of eight years of eligibility. There is also a national\ncap that may reduce the realized value for any single reactor. Nonetheless, this is a sizable subsidy\nfor a new plant, and one that UniStar assumes it will get a piece of.\nAccelerated depreciation. Normal accounting rules allow capital investments to be deducted from\ntaxable income over the service life of the investment. Faster deductions shelter taxable income in\nthe early years of an investment, generating a net gain to the firm. The larger the investment, and\nthe more rapid the write-off relative to actual service life, the larger the subsidy will be. Nuclear\nreactors, which can last 40-60 years, can be written off from taxes entirely in only 15 years. This\ngenerates a reduction in levelized power costs of roughly 0.3 to 0.6 cents per kWh.\nAccident liability. The Price-Anderson act provides liability protection for the life of a nuclear\nfacility even if the Act expires while a plant is still operating. New reactors such as Calvert Cliffs-\n3, however, would not have been covered without more recent reauthorization of the Act, a law that\nwhen passed in 1957 was supposed to last only 10 years. Continued reauthorizations are predicated\non the claim that private insurance cover still remains limited, Yet cover has grown for risks inside\nthe plant wall: damage to plant and equipment from an accident, and coverage for interruption of\npower deliveries. In fact, if coverage on the existing reactors is an indication, Calvert Cliffs-3 will\nbuy ten times as much cover for internal damages and interruptions than it will be required to buy\n255 Transcript to the Committee Workshop before the California Energy Resources Conservation and\nDevelopment Corporation in the matter of “Preparation of the 2007 Integrated Energy Policy Report,”\n28 June 2007, Volume IT.\n26 Joe Turnage, \"New Nuclear Development: Part of the Strategy for a Lower Carbon Energy Future\",\npresentation at the International Trade Administration Nuclear Energy Summit, 8 October 2008.\n\nto protect the 7.6 million people in the surrounding area and all of their property in the case of an\naccident.*7\nManagement of long-lived nuclear waste. Calvert Cliffs-3 will also benefit from risk shifting on\nthe management of high-level radioactive waste. Poor risk sharing on this issue in the past has\nresulted in multi-billion dollar liabilities to the US taxpayer due to delays in the opening of a\nfederal radioactive waste repository at Yucca Mountain in Nevada. These challenges are likely to\nremain; yet because of the subsidy, the technical and financial risks of waste management will not\naffect the decision on whether to build or operate Calvert Cliffs-3.\nTable 11: Public subsidies to Calvert Cliffs-3 approach private capital at risk and exceed\nvalue of power produced\nPo tow igh Notes\nPo ents perk\nL.PrivateinvestmentinCalvertciiffsm | JP\nBase case of Calvert Cliffs 5.7 5.7 Constellation estimate, Oct.\n2008\nW.PublicinvestmentinCalvertciffsm [| | P\nA.

The results are striking: public investments in\nthe plant approach or exceed private capital put at risk, a poor venture structure for achieving\nsuccess. The public subsidies are larger than the value of the power produced, an indication of a\n\"value subtracting\" industry. In fact, based on Constellation’s own cost models, the power from this\nplant is not competitive without subsidy.\n\nIl1.6.4. Subsidies to the UK’s Existing Nuclear Power Plants*®\n\nThe UK’s operating reactors can be split into three groups, those of the first generation British\ndesign known as Magnox, the second generation British-design known as the Advanced Gas-\ncooled Reactors (AGR) and a single plant using the Westinghouse Pressurized Water Reactor\n(PWR) design. The Magnox stations were completed between 1956 and 1971 and only the two\nmost recent plants were still in operation in March 2009. Eight of the eleven Magnox stations were\nbuilt as twin reactors by the Central Electricity Generating Board (CEGB), the nationalized\nelectricity generation and transmission company that covered England and Wales. One station, also\ncomprising twin reactors was built by the nationally-owned integrated electricity company that\nsupplied the South part of Scotland, the South of Scotland Electricity Board (SSEB). Two further\nstations each comprised four reactors and were dual purpose plutonium/electricity production units\nowned and operated by British Nuclear Fuels Limited, the nationally-owned nuclear technology\ncompany.\n\nThe seven AGR stations each comprised twin reactors of about 600 MW and were ordered in two\nbatches, five in 1965-69, of which one was owned by SSEB, and two in 1979, one of which was\nbuilt by SSEB. The plants were originally given a design life of 30 years, but their life has been\nextended and the two oldest stations have now received regulatory approval in principle to run for\nAQ years. The lifetimes of all the stations are currently expected to be extended to 40 years but the\nowners do not make the case to the regulators until the plants are within three years of closure so\nonly the two oldest stations are currently listed as having a 40-year life.\n\nConstruction of the PWR was started in 1987 by the CEGB, but in 1990, when this company was\nbroken up and privatized, the plant passed to a new nationally-owned company, Nuclear Electric,\nwhich completed the plant in 1995.\n\nUI.6.4.1. The Period Up to 1990\n\nIt has become clear that none of these plants has ever been an economic source of power on a full-\ncost basis. Up to 1990, there was a common perception, encouraged by the nuclear industry and the\nutilities, that nuclear power represented a cheap source of power. Analyses purporting to show the\nfull economic cost of nuclear power were published by the CEGB™, but these were riddled with\nmethodological errors and the failed attempt to privatize the nuclear plants in 1990 demonstrated\nthese analyses were largely worthless.\n\n3° Jamie Smith Hopkins and Paul Adams, \"Calvert County solicits reactor,\" Baltimore Sun, 9 August 2006.\n302 Calvert County, \"Budget Summary: FY2009 Commissioners Report\", Maryland, 2009.\n\n303 Based on Steve Thomas, “Nuclear Power in Britain Since Chernobyl: A Rollercoaster Ride”, in Lutz Mez,\nMycle Schneider & Steve Thomas, “International Perspectives on Energy Policy and the Role of Nuclear\nPower”, Multi-Science Publishing, Brentwood, 2009.\n\n304 For example, Central Electricity Generating Board, “Analysis of generation costs 1983”, CEGB, London,\n1983.\n\n3 Gordon MacKerron, “Nuclear power under review”, in John Surrey, “The British electricity experiment,\nPrivatisation: the record, the issues, the lessons”, Earthscan, London, 1996.\n\nHowever, while the electricity system was operated by integrated, publicly-owned monopolies\nwithout explicit regulatory procedures, it was impossible to disentangle the nuclear costs from the\nother costs of the industry so while it is now clear that nuclear power was not an economic power\nsource up to 1990, there were no explicit subsidies.\n\nIn 1987, the British government announced its intention to privatize and break-up the electricity\ncompanies and operate the system on competitive lines. It assumed that the nuclear plants would be\nsaleable despite the fact that the Magnox plants were already near or at the end of their design lives\n(25 years). The program of 10 PWR orders (originally, one order per year was to be placed from\n1981 onwards) announced by Margaret Thatcher in 1979 had shrunk to four, only one of which\nwas ready to be placed. Implicitly, it was assumed the value of the existing plants would be\ndetermined by the market so the new owners would not have to recover all the costs involved in\nbuilding them. It was acknowledged that new plants that had to repay in full their construction cost\nwould probably not be economic but that the government could impose on the electricity retail\ncompanies an obligation to purchase a proportion, to be specified by the government, of their\nsupplies from nuclear plants, the Non-Fossil Fuel Obligation (NFFO). As the old plants were\nretired, the retail companies would have to commission a generation company to build new nuclear\ncapacity so they could fulfill their quota. This mechanism was expected to mean that building the\nfour new PWRs would not be an inordinate economic risk to the company that was building them.\nThe possibility of a consumer subsidy for nuclear power, the Fossil Fuel Levy (FFL), was mooted\nas a possibility but no indication of the scale of the subsidy was given nor how it would work.\n\nThe utilities did nothing in 1987/88 to disabuse the government of the belief that this new system\ncould work. This is perhaps indicative that not only was the government, through the then\nDepartment of Energy unaware of how poor the economics of nuclear were, but also that few in the\nCEGB and SSEB were aware of how expensive the nuclear plants would turn out to be once their\ncosts had been properly separated from other costs. By summer 1989, the scale of the additional\ncosts was becoming clear and also that the NFFO was not feasible. In fact, it was the company that\nwas expected to own the nuclear plants, which became National Power that appears to have been\nstrongest in warning the government of the infeasibility of its plans.\n\nIn a series of hurried and unwieldy changes, the nuclear plants were withdrawn from the\nprivatization. The CEGB’s Magnox reactors and AGRs were placed in a new nationally-owned\ncompany, Nuclear Electric, while the SSEB’s reactors were given to another new publicly owned\ncompany, Scottish Nuclear. The FFL was introduced for Nuclear Electric and set at a level that\nwould allow Nuclear Electric to remain ‘cash positive’ so that it could continue to trade legally.\nThe subsidy was collected as about 10% of all electricity bills and yielded about £tbn per year. The\nlevel of payments was set for the eight years that followed so that Nuclear Electric’s income was\nassured — if the price they received for their power went down, the subsidy went up, and vice versa.\nDifferent arrangements applied to Scotland, which essentially required the privatized companies to\nbuy all Scottish Nuclear’s output at pre-determined prices. In the whole of the UK, the retail market\nfor residential consumers was expected to remain a monopoly until 1998 so the retail companics\nwere able to pass on any extra costs to residential consumers without fear that competitors, which\ndid not have to buy nuclear power, would enter the market and undercut them.\n\nThe European Commission judged the FFL to be ‘state aid’, which under most circumstances is\nagainst European law, but the FFL was allowed provided it was phased out by 1998. A review of\nwhether Sizewell-B, the PWR on which construction had been started in 1987, should be\ncompleted was launched and a review of government policy on nuclear power was to be carried out\nin 1994, when it was expected that Sizewell B would be in service. The review of Sizewell was\ncompleted in 1991 and it was argued that the costs already incurred were so large that cancelling\nthe plant would not result in any savings.\n\nProvisions to pay for nuclear decommissioning collected before privatization, given a value of\n£3.8bn in the accounts of the nationalized companies, were not segregated from the assets of the\n\ncompanies and were not passed on to Nuclear Electric and Scottish Nuclear, and were thus\neffectively Jost>°°\n\nOverall, it is now clear that nuclear power was uneconomic throughout the period up to 1990 but\nthere were no major explicit subsidies: additional costs were simply passed on to consumers.\nTII.6.4.2, The Period 1990-1996\n\nThe haste with which the privatization plans were changed and the FFL introduced meant these\nwere ill thought-out. From 1990-96, about £6bn was collected from consumers under the FFL\nessentially as a nuclear subsidy. In theory, the FFL was payable to all technologies that did not use\nfossil fuels but, in practice, about 97% of the amount collected was paid to Nuclear Electric.\nMichael Heseltine, then the responsible government minister, told Parliament this was “to pay for\nthe decommissioning of old and unsafe stations’*°’. This statement was not accurate. There were no\nrestrictions on the way Nuclear Electric could spend the FFL and it was therefore used by Nuclear\nElectric as additional cash flow. A small amount was spent on decommissioning, nearly half was\nunspent, but the rest was spent by Nuclear Electric mecting its immediate costs. Given that Nuclear\nElectric’s marginal expenditure was on the construction of the Sizewell B plant, which it built with\nno recourse to borrowing despite being effectively bankrupt, it must be concluded that a large\namount of the FFL was effectively spent on building Sizewell B and must be seen as a consumer\nsubsidy.\n\nSizewell B was completed in 1995 at a cost in excess of £3bn (in 1995 money). By the standards\nof the time, this was a huge price” although Nuclear Electric tried to explain the high cost as due\nto its bearing first of a kind costs. The unspent subsidy was mostly passed on to BNFL with a small\namount (£227m) being passed on to the privatized nuclear generation company, British Energy,\ncreated in 1996 (see below).\n\nThe improved reliability of the AGRs meant that by 1995, Nuclear Electric was able to cover its\noperating costs by proceeds of sale of electricity and in its review of its nuclear policy, the\ngovernment proposed the privatization of the AGRs and Sizewell-B and the removal of the nuclear\nsubsidy. This was carried out in 1996 with the creation of British Energy to own the AGRs and\nSizewell-B. The Magnox reactors clearly had to remain in public ownership and were placed in a\nnew company, Magnox Electric, which was absorbed into BNFL in 1998. The FFL was removed in\n1996, reducing electricity prices by 10%.\n\nBritish Energy was sold for only about £1.7bn for the eight stations, about half the cost of just\nbuilding Sizewell-B. No authoritative estimate of the cost of building the seven AGR stations has\never been given. However, their very troubled construction period — the worst station, Dungeness-B\ntook 18-20 years of continuous construction before first power and then a further 4-6 years of\ntesting before it was declared commercial — means that these plants must have been very expensive\nto build. If we assume their cost (in £1995) was £2bn each, only two thirds of the cost of building\nSizewell-B, this means that assets that had cost consumers £17bn, were sold for only 10% of that\nvalue.\n\nIn fact, it was only possible to sell the stations for a positive sum because of manipulation of\ndecommissioning liabilities. Decommissioning funds are normally set up to pay for all three stages\nof decommissioning — stage 1 is de-fuelling, stage 2 is removal of uncontaminated or lightly\ncontaminated buildings and stage 3 is removal of all other parts. In undiscounted terms, stage 1\naccounts for perhaps 10% of the cost of decommissioning, but if we discount the two later stages\nand we use the very long time frames assumed in the UK for the later stages (70 yeats or more\nbefore stage 3 is started), stage 1 accounts for nearly half the discounted estimated cost. Under the\n3° Stephen Thomas, “The organisation & the costs of the decommissioning nuclear plants in the UK”,\nEconomia delle fonti di energia e¢ dell’ambicnte, no. 2, 2008.\n\n°° M Heseltine, President of the Board of Trade, Hansard, 19 October 1992.\n\n3% Gordon MacKerron, “The Capital Costs of Sizewell C.”, submitted to the Government’s Nuclear Review\nas COLA 3, 1994.\n\n> Ifwe assume inflation has been 3% per year since 1995 and that the exchange rate is £1=US$1,50, that\nworks out at a construction cost of nearly $6000/KW.\n\nterms of the privatization, although a segregated decommissioning fund was set up, it only had to\ncover stages 2 and 3, with stage 1 expected to be paid out of cash-flow. As soon became clear, this\nwas a reckless assumption because British Energy could not be assumed to have any available cash\nflow.\nThe government also found no case for providing the public subsidies that would have been\nnecessary to allow the construction of the three further PWRs planned to follow Sizewell B. The\nadditional output from the AGRs and the longer life of the Magnox units meant new capacity was\nnot needed to retain the nuclear contribution to the generation mix at the existing level.\nOverall, for the period 1990-96, consumers paid about £6bn to subsidize nuclear power, overtly to\npay for decommissioning and waste management. In fact, only about £250m was actually spent on\nthis, with about half the rest passed on to BNFL and British Energy to pay for decommissioning,\nwhile the rest was implicitly spent on building a new nuclear power station, which, within a year of\nits completion, was effectively given away.\n111.6.4.3. The Period 1996-2002 — British Energy\nBy 1998, British Energy was apparently flourishing, its share price having doubled. In the USA, in\npartnership with a US utility, PECO (later this merged with another utility and became Exelon) ina\njoint venture created in 1997, Amergen, it bought existing nuclear plants. It followed this up with a\ndeal to operate eight nuclear reactors in Ontario (Bruce Power). However, by 2000, the reality that\nBritish Energy’s initial success had been built on an inflated wholesale electricity price sustained\nby an uncompetitive generation structure was becoming apparent. Improvements in output had\ndried up and operating cost reductions also seemed to have reached a limit. The intrinsic\nunreliability of the AGRs was acknowledged by British Energy.\nIn 2002, British Energy had to seek assistance from the British government, which, on 5 September\nthat year, provided a credit facility of up to £410m, subsequently increased on 26 September to\n£650m. British Energy had been successfully reducing its operating costs, ironically reaching its\nlowest point almost in the year it collapsed. However, its profitability was determined by a\nwholesale electricity price that had been kept artificially high by a highly concentrated electricity\nmarket and when this started to fall from 2000 onwards, it was clearly going to get into serious\ntrouble. On 28 November 2002, a rescuc plan was agrecd with the government, the main clements\nof which were:\n\n+ A renegotiation of the contracts with BNFL for new fuel and for the reprocessing of spent\n\nfuel;\n¢ A reduction in the contributions British Energy had to make to the decommissioning fund;\nand\n\n* The sale of British Energy’s North American holdings in Bruce Power and Amergen.\n1.6.4.4. The Period 2002 Onwards — British Energy\nThe government acknowledged that this rescue package was ‘state aid’ and an investigation was\nlaunched by the European Commission into whether it constituted unfair state aid.*\"” The European\nCommission valued these measures at an undiscounted sum of £10bn, but decided to allow the\nrescue plan in September 2004.?\"! British Energy was relaunched in January 2005, since when, the\nshares have increased in value from the re-launch price of £2.85 to a peak of over £7 in 2006.\nThe restructuring package consisted of seven measures that were agreed between British Energy,\nits major creditors (including BNFL), and the UK Government:\n3!° State aid per se is not illegal under European Union law, but if it is considered to be distorting\ncompetition, it is.\n34 Buropean Commission, “Commission decision of 22 September 2004 on the State aid which the\nUnited Kingdom is planning to implement for British Energy ple”, Official Journal of the European\nUnion, European Commission, £ 142, 06/06/2005 pp 26-80;\nhttp://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUniServ.do?uri=OJ-L:2005:142:0026:0080:EN:PDF .\n\nA. measures linked to the funding of nuclear liabilities;\n\nB. measures concerning the fuel chain agreed with BNFL;\n\nC.. standstill measures;\n\nD. significant creditors restructuring package;\n\nE. introduction of a new trading strategy;\n\nF. asset disposals to help finance the restructuring;\n\nG. local tax deferrals.\n\nA. Measures linked to the funding of nuclear liabilities\nThese were the main measures and were subdivided into sub-categories\n\n1. Historic fuel contracts. The British government assumed responsibility for the cost of these\ncontracts for reprocessing spent fuel.\n\n2. Uncontracted liabilities. The government agreed to meet these costs through a Nuclear\nLiabilities Fund (NLF). The liabilities included final disposal of spent fuel, plutonium,\nuranium and wastes arising from the reprocessing of AGR fuel, the storage and final\ndisposal of spent PWR fuel, including the construction of a dry store at Sizewell-B, and the\nstorage and disposal of operational wastes.\n\n3. Decommissioning liabilities. The government undertook to pay any costs that could not be\ncovered by the NLF.\n\n4, Tax disregard. This represents the value of the tax that would be due if the previous three\n“assets” were taxable. The UK government introduced legislation to prevent them being\ntaxed.\n\nThese measures (see Table 12) were offset because the value of the existing decommissioning\nfund, the Nuclear Decommissioning Fund (NDF), was transferred to the NLF; and British Energy\nwas required to continue to make a small annual payment into the NLF of about £20m.\nTable 12: Value of Measure A (£m)\noe A\n\ndiscounted at nominal 5.4%\nSource: http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=OJ:b:2005:142:0026:0080:EN:PDF\nNote: The discount rate of 5.4 % nominal rate recommended as the reference rate from 1 January 2003 in\naccordance with European Commission notice on the method for setting the reference and discount rates.\nB. Measures concerning the fuel chain agreed with BNFL\nAs a part of the restructuring plan, BNFL (nationally-owned), which was British Energy’s largest\nsingle creditor, has agreed to modify its fuel supply and spent fuel reprocessing contracts with\nBritish Energy (see Table 12). The value of these changes was estimated in two parts, from 2004-\n08 and from 2008 onwards and under three scenarios, ‘upside’ (lowest cost to taxpayers),\n‘downside’ (highest cost to taxpayers) and ‘bank’ (the central assumption)). The British\ngovernment claimed that giving precise estimates of the savings by British Energy after 2006\nwould be difficult, as the pre-restructuring fuel supply contracts were planned to end in 2006. The\nuse of different discount rates for Measures A and Measures B mean that the discounted values are\ndifficult to compare.\n\nTable 13: Value of Measure B (£m)\nUpside Bank Downside\n2004-08 46 72 103\nUndiscounted -87 559 1,113\nNet present value discounted -289 174 589\nat real 3.5%\nSource: http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=OJ-L:2005:142:0026:0080:EN:PDF\nNote: The real discount rate of 3.5% corresponds to the public sector discount rate.\nC. Standstill Measures\nAs part of the restructuring plan, British Energy reached agreements (the Standstill Agreements) in\nrelation to a standstill, subject to certain conditions, of payments due to BNFL and a number of\nsignificant financial creditors (see Table 14). This agreement applied to 2003 and 2004.\nTable 14: Value of Measure B (£m)\n2003 2004 Total\nCash Savings 300 642 942\nSource: http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=OfL:2005:142:0026:0080:EN:PDF\nD. Significant creditors restructuring package\nIn addition to the Standstill Agreements, the restructuring plan provides for the claims of the\nsignificant creditors to be restructured and rescheduled. The liabilities of the significant creditors\nthat were restructured totaled £1263m. The liabilities were restructured by issuing new bonds and\nshares in British Energy. No value of this package was given, presumably because the creditors\nwere all private sector companies and the cost was not borne by the taxpayer.\nE. Introduction of a new trading strategy\nA new trading strategy for the output of the British Energy plants was introduced. Again, this\nseems to have involved no cost to the taxpayer.\nF, Asset disposals to help finance the restructuring\nThe Bruce Power and Amergen assets were sold, but again with no cost implications for the\ntaxpayer,\nG. Local tax deferrals\nFive local authorities agreed to defer without interest the payment of business rates owed to them\nby British Energy. In total, £4.3m in rates payments were postponed from November 2002 to\nFebruary 2003. The rates were paid by British Energy in full in February 2003 and interest for late\npayment was paid in October 2003. So there appears to have been no cost to the taxpayer (or local\nauthorities).\n1.6.4.5. Total Value of State Aid\nIf we take the ‘bank’ case for Measures B, the total value of the state aid was over £11.5bn (sce\nTable 15).\nTable 15: Value of all measures (£m)\nUndiscounted\nvalue\nMeasures A 10,071\nMeasures B 559\nMeasures C 942\nTotal 11,572\n\nIn return for this state aid, the government was entitled to 65% of British Energy’s net cash flow,\nthe Cash Sweep, after tax, financing costs and the £20m annual payment to the NLF. This would be\npaid into the NLF, but could be converted at any time to shares. No payment was made for the\nfinancial year 2004/05 — the company was only re-launched in January 2005, but payments were\nmade in the following two years (see Table 16). In 2007/08, the Cash Sweep was equivalent to\n£305m, but the NLF waived its right to £134m. No payment was made for the first half of 2008/09\nand it is not clear if any payment will be made for the second half of 2008/09.\nTable 16: Cash sweep payments to the NLF (£m)\n\nPayments.\n2004/05 oO\n2005/06 105\n2007/08 i71\nTotal 276\nSource: British Energy Annual Report and Accounts, various\nIn May 2007, the government announced its intention to convert nearly half of its Cash Sweep\nentitlement to shares and sell them, This was done on 6 June 2007 and raised about £2.34bn, which\nwas paid into the NLF. The Cash Sweep entitlement was reduced to 35.1%. In December 2008,\nEDF agreed to a bid of £12.5bn to take over the whole of British Energy, which involved buying\nthe remaining 36% share entitlement of the British government. This raised £4.42bn, which was\npaid into the NLF.*” Despite the takeover, the government retains all its liabilities for British\nEnergy, including the obligation to meet any shortfall in the NLF.\nA total of £7bn has been paid into the NLF as a result of the Cash Sweep arrangements, nearly\nmatching the £84bn that the government forecast was the value of its Measures on\ndecommissioning and historic fuel contracts. However, in the four years since its rescue, the\nliabilities that are to be met out of the NLF (uncontracted back end fuel costs and\ndecommissioning) have increased in cost from £8.8bn (£5.2bn of which is for decommissioning) to\n£12.1bn (£9.4bn of which is for decommissioning) so the NLF is far from certain to have sufficient\nfunds that the taxpayer will not have to bear some of the cost.\nEven if we assume that there will be no cost to the taxpayer for uncontracted back end fuel costs\nand decommissioning, the estimated cost of the rescue of British Energy was still about £3.4bn.\nThe National Audit Office (NAO) was critical of the British government for not monitoring the\nscale of British Energy’s liabilities. As the rescue proved, the taxpayer would inevitably have to\npick up these large liabilitics in the event of the failure of British Energy and the NAO argucd that\nthe government should have monitored these liabilities more carefully”?\nTIL6.4,6, The Period 1996 Onwards — BNFL\nMost of the unspent proceeds of the FFL (about £2.7bn) were passed to the new owners of the\nMagnox stations, Magnox Electric. This was because the Magnox stations are expensive to\ndecommission and were then near retirement so the need for funds was more urgent than for the\nBritish Energy stations. In 1998, Magnox Electric became a division of BNFL. The unspent\nproceeds were separately identified in BNFL’s accounts as the Nuclear Liabilities Investment\nPortfolio (NLIP) and were invested in a way intended to ensure they would not lose value. By\n2004, with additions from BNFL and interest, the fund had grown to a little over £4bn. However,\nthe fund was an internal one, not rigorously separated from BNFL’s business. In addition, BNFL\nwas in increasingly deep financial trouble because it could not cover its assets and was allowed to\ncontinue to trade only through government assurances (the Secretary of State’s Undertaking).\nThe government finally lost patience with BNFL in 2003 and decided to take away all BNFL’s\nsites and give them to the then-to-be-established Nuclear Decommissioning Agency (NDA). The\n32 Press Association, “Nuclear sale raises £4.5bn for decommissioning fund”, 19 January 2009.\n33 National Audit Office, “The restructuring of British Energy”, National Audit Office, London, 2006,\nhttp:/Avww.nao.org.uk/publications/0506/restructuring_of british_energ.aspx#fnl .\n\nTreasury quietly absorbed the NLIP into its other income and this money was spent in the same\nwas as all other government income.\n\n1.6.5. The Future\n\nWhen British Energy collapsed in 2002/03, its operating costs were £18.6/MWh up from £16.7 in\n2001/02, but its average selling price was only £18.3/MWh. Since its relaunch in 2005, the\ncompany has generated large profits and is seen as being highly successful. However, this success\nseems to have everything to do with high electricity prices and little to do with the performance of\nthe company. Its operating costs have continued to rise, reaching £30/MWh in 2007/08. Fortunately\nfor British Energy, the electricity price has increased even faster and in 2007/08, it reached\n£40.7/MWh. However, in the first half of 2008/09, its operating cost had soared to £41.9/MWh.\nFortunately, the selling price had remained high, at £47.2/MWh. However, if as seems likely,\npower prices fall sharply as demand declines and fossil fuel prices fall, British Energy could be\ntrading at a loss again. In the longer term, the stations are now ageing rapidly and costs will\ncontinue to fall so the company may well fall into losses sooner or later. It remains to be seen\nwhether the liabilities it leaves, if EDF is not prepared to meet them, will fall on taxpayers again.\nConclusions on UK Subsidies\n\nUp to 1990, there were no overt subsidies for nuclear power. While it is clear the nuclear plants\nwere far from economic, the additional costs, which are now impossible to estimate, were simply\npassed on to consumers. From 1990-96, there was an explicit consumer subsidy of about £1bn per\nyear. About half of this was spent on a new nuclear plant, which quickly proved to be essentially\nworthless; and nearly all the rest was quietly expropriated by the Treasury in 2005 and used for\ngeneral government current expenditure. Only £227m was retained and is available for the use the\npublic was told it was for — decommissioning.\n\nThe privatization of British Energy was only possible by selling at a price that was only a small\nfraction of the cost of the assets and with too little attention paid to the liabilities that would fall on\nthe public purse if the company failed. When this did happen in 2002, the government decided to\nintervene and not, as would have been normal policy, allow the company to close. The resulting\nrescue was estimated by the government to cost taxpayers more than £11bn. High electricity prices\nhave meant that the government has been able to recoup some of these losses by selling its shares\nin the company, but the risk of British Energy failing again is clear and further costs could still fall\non the taxpayer.IV. Overview by Region and Country™*\n\n1V.1. Africa\n\nSouth Africa has two French (Framatome) built reactors. Construction started in the 1970s and\nthey are both at the Koeberg site, east of Cape Town, which supply 5.2% (down from 6% in 2003)\nof the country’s electricity. The reactors are the only operating nuclear power plants on the African\ncontinent.\n\nThe South African, state-owned, utility Eskom launched an effort in 1998 to develop the PBMR\n(Pebble Bed Modular Reactor), a helium-cooled graphite moderated reactor based on earlier\nGerman designs. Initially it was forecast that a demonstration plant would be built and commercial\norders would be possible from 2004 onwards. A wholly-owned subsidiary company PBMR Ltd\nwas set up in 2000 and a number of investors, including the UK state-owned BNFL and the US\nutility PECO Energy (later Exelon) as well as the Industrial Development Corporation, which is\nowned by the South African Government, and Eskom itself, promised to fund a feasibility phase. In\nDecember 2001 Exelon said that it was considering building a PBMR reactor in the USA in parallel\n3!4 Unless otherwise mentioned, the figures on the numbers of reactors operating (by May 2009) and the\nnuclear share in the electricity generation (in 2008) are taken from the IAEA’s Power Reactor Information\nSystem (PRIS) on-line data. The figures on the nuclear share of commercial primary energy production are\ntaken from BP, \"Statistical Review of World Energy\", June 2009, The numbers of reactors under\nconstruction are essentially based on [AEA’s PRIS as of 1* August 2009.\n\nto those proposed in South Africa. However, following a change in management at Exelon, the\ncompany withdrew from the PBMR project entirely in April 2002.\nAll except Eskom failed to invest as much as promised, costs escalated dramatically and time-\nscales slipped, leaving Eskom and the South African government to pick up the costs. In 2008,\noperation of the demonstration plant was not expected before 2016. Its costs had increased by\nalmost 10-fold from the early estimates and commercial orders were not expected before 2026.\nSerious technical issues also emerged’ and in February 2009, Eskom, the only potential customer,\nabandoned plans to build the demonstration plant. In May 2009, PBMR Ltd was still deciding what\nto do, but its funds are due to run out in early 2010 and if no new investors emerge, the company\nwill have to close.*\"6\nDelays with the PBMR led Eskom to consider buying large PWRs, short-listing the AREVA NP\nEPR and the Westinghouse AP-1000. It had a budget of R343bn (US$34bn) to build 16 GW of new\ncoal and nuclear plant by 2017. In the longer term, it planned to build 20 GW of nuclear plant by\n2025.

Americas\nArgentina operates two nuclear reactors that provide less than 6.2% (down from 9% in 2003) of\nthe country’s electricity. Argentina was one of the countries that embarked on an ambiguous\nnuclear program, officially for civil purposes but with a strong military lobby behind it,\nNevertheless, the two nuclear plants were supplied by foreign reactor builders, Atucha-1, a heavy\nwater reactor of a unique design which started operation in 1974, was supplied by Siemens and the\nCandu type reactor at Embalse by the Canadian AECL. Embalse was connected to the grid in 1983.\nAtucha-2, officially listed as “under construction” since 1981, was to be built by a joint Siemens-\nArgentinean company “that ceased in 1994 with the paralization of the project”.”! Nevertheless, in\n2004 the LAEA estimated that the start-up of Atucha-2 was to be expected in 2005. At the end of\n2007, the IAEA’s expected start-up date had turned into a question mark that was replaced by 1\nOctober 2010 as a new projected date for grid connection. By the middle of 2008 the plant was\nabout 80% complete.\nTn July 2007 Argentina’s Nucleoelectrica signed an agreement with Atomic Energy of Canada Ltd.\n(AECL) to enter into commercial negotiations over the potential delivery of a 740 MW Candu-6\nreactor.

Their industrial as well as their non-proliferation record has\nbeen far from convincing.\n\nBrazil operates two nuclear reactors that provide the country with 3.1% of its electricity (down\nfrom 4% in 2003). As early as 1970, the first contract for the construction of a nuclear power plant,\nAngra-1, was awarded to Westinghouse. The reactor went critical in 1981. In 1975, Brazil signed\nwith Germany what remains probably the largest single contract in the history of the world nuclear\nindustry for the construction of eight 1,300 MW reactors over a 15 year period. The outcome was a\ndisaster. Due to an ever-increasing debt burden and obvious interest in nuclear weapons by the\nBrazilian military, practically the entire program was abandoned. Only the first reactor covered by\nthe program, Angra-2, was finally connected to the grid in July 2000, 24 years after construction\nstarted.\n\nThe construction of Angra-3 was abandoned in June 1991. Hopes of Eletronuclear, the owner of\nthe plant, to relaunch construction received a severe damper in July 2008 when Environment\nMinister Carlos Mince announced 60 stiff “pre-license” conditions for the completion of the unit.\nThe most difficult challenge will no doubt be to provide a “definite” solution for final disposal of\nhigh-level radioactive waste. Indeed, the completion of Angra-3 now “looks more doubtful”,\nCanada was one of the early investors in nuclear power and began developing a new design of\nheavy water reactor in 1944, This set the development of the Canadian reactor program down a\nunique path, with the adoption of the Candu — CANadian Deuterium Uranium — reactor design. The\nkey differences between the Candu and the more widely adopted light water reactors are that they\nare fuelled by natural uranium, can refuel without shutting down and are cooled and moderated by\nheavy water.\n\nOfficially, there are 18 reactors in operation, all of which are Candus providing 14.8% (up from\n12.5% in 2003) of the country’s electricity. Four additional units are listed by the IAEA as in “long\nterm shutdown”. Throughout their operational history the Canadian reactors have been plagucd by\ntechnical problems that led to construction cost over-runs and reduced annual capacity factors. In\nAugust 1997 Ontario Hydro announced that it would temporarily shut down its oldest seven\nreactors to allow a significant overhaul to be undertaken. The four reactors at Pickering-A were\nshut down at the end of 1997 with the three remaining Bruce-A reactors closed on 31 March 1998 -\nunit 2 at Bruce A had already been closed in October 1995. At the time it was the largest single\nshutdown in the international history of nuclear power -- over 5,000 MW of nuclear capacity, one\nthird of Canada’s nuclear plants. The utility, Ontario Hydro, called for the “phased recovery” of its\nnuclear reactors starting with “extensive upgrades” to the operating stations - Pickering B, Bruce B,\nand Darlington - and then their return to service. There have been significant delays in restarting\nthe reactors and as of May 2009 only four of the eight reactors had returned to operation; two more\nare scheduled to come back online later in 2009 or early 2010. The two remaining Bruce-A3 and -\nA4, according to Bruce Power “one of North America’s most complex engineering projects”, are\nslated to be back online by 2013.7\n\nIn March 2009, Bruce Power announced that it is looking at the Whitemud site close to Lac\nCardinal in Alberta for a nuctcar plant of up to 4,000MW. The company had sclected another site a\nyear earlier but abandoned it following massive opposition. Bruce Power predicts a 10-year site\npreparation and construction phase, so that the units would start up well after 2020. No decision has\nbeen taken at this point.\n\nOn 16 June 2008 the Canadian government announced Darlington in Ontario as the site for a two-\nunit new build project and on 20 May 2009 information leaked that the Ontario government had\nchosen AECL as the leading bidder over AREVA and Westinghouse to start building the first new\nnuclear plants in Canada in 25 years. Two new reactors were projected to start operating by 2018.\n32 WNN, “The completion of Brazil’s Angra-3 reactor looks more doubtful after the country’s environment\nminister set 60 tough conditions for the project”, 24 July 2008.\n\n33 Bruce Power, “Bruce A Restart & Refurbishment project expanded”, 29 August 2007;\nhttp://vww.brucepower.com/pagecontentU12.aspx?navuid=5002&dtuid=83558 accessed 22 May 2009.\n\nHowever, the provincial government reportedly conditioned any go-ahead on financial guarantees\nby the federal government to cover the financial risks involved.>”*\n\nIn early July 2009, the Ontario government shelved the entire plan and Premier McGuinty stated:\n\"We didn’t factor in the single greatest global economic recession in the past 80 years.”\"* So power\nneeds were actually declining rather than increasing as had been forecasted, leaving the province\nwith more time to make a decision on new build.\n\nNew Brunswick is investigating the option of adding a second nuclear reactor at its Point Lepreau.\nsite; but meanwhile a $1.4 billion refurbishment project on the first unit is running at least three\nmonths late and could extend well into 2010. The unit has been down since April 2008.\n\nAny new-build plan in Canada risks running into massive difficulties. There is substantial local\nopposition against projects, in particular in Alberta and Saskatchewan. The industry would have to\ncope with extensive refurbishment and new-build activities at the same time. As in other countries,\nthe Canadian nuclear industry faces a severe shortage in skilled workers. The President of the\nCanadian Nuclear Safety Commission (CNSC) has stated that CNSC is \"facing many of same\nissues as the rest of the nuclear industry\", including a 10% annual turnover and 23% of the\nworkforce eligible to retire in the next five years.’”° New build would also involve a new design of\nCandu, ACR-1000, which, unlike the earlier plants, would use light water as coolant. This would\nhave to undergo a thorough regulatory review and its costs are therefore, as yct, impossible to\nestimate.\n\nAECL has, with the support of the Canadian Export Credit Agency, undertaken an aggressive\nmarketing campaign to sell reactors abroad and to date 12 units have been exported to South Korea\n(4), Romania (2), India (2), China (2), Pakistan (1), Argentina (1). The export market remains a\ncrucial component of the AECL’s reactors development program. In September 2004, a\nMemorandum of Understanding was signed with the National Nuclear Safety Administration of\nChina. This MoU will in part facilitate the development of AECL’s Advanced Candu Reactors.\nCanada is the world’s largest producer of uranium and in 2008 produced about 21% of the global\ntotal.\n\nThe development of nuclear power in Mexico began in the 1960s with site investigations and a call\nfor tenders was announced in 1969. In 1976 General Electric began the construction of the Laguna\nVerde power plant, with a proposat to build two 650 MW reactors. The first unit went into\ncommercial operation in 1990 and the second in April 1995. In 2008, nuclear power produced 4%\n(down from 5.2% in 2003) of the country’s electricity. An uprating project that is currently\nunderway is hoped to raise installed capacity of both units by about 20%. There are some vague\nproposals but no concrete plans to build new reactors.\n\nThe United States has more operating nuclear power plants than any other country in the world,\nwith 104 commercial reactors providing 19.7% of the electricity (roughly stable since 2003).\nAlthough there are a large number of operating reactors in the USA, the number of cancelled\nprojects — 138 units — is even larger. It is now 36 years since a new order that has not subsequently\nbeen cancelled (October 1973) has been placed. In 2007 for the first time in three decades, utilities\nrequested a license to build a nuclear plant. NRG/Exelon announced plans to build two reactors at\nthe South Texas site that already operates two Westinghouse pressurized water reactors.\n\nThe last reactor to be completed was Watts Bar 1, in 1996 and the construction licenses on a further\nfour (Watts Bar-2, Bellefonte-1 and -2, and WNP-1) was recently extended, although there is no\nactive construction on these sites. In October 2007 TVA announced that it had chosen the Bechtel\ngroup to complete the two-thirds built, 1,200 MW Watts Bar-2 reactor for $2.5 billion.\n34 The Globe and Mail, “AECL favoured to build Ontario reactors: sources”, 20 May 2009,\n\n5 The Star, \"Economy let us delay nuclear plan, premier says\", 7 July 2009.\n\n3°6 Michael Binder, President, Canadian Nuclear Safety Commission, \"Moving Forward\", Presentation, 4\nJune 2008.\n\nConstruction had been originally started in 1972, but was frozen in 1985 and abandoned in 1994,\nConstruction has restarted and is now expected to take until 2012 to finish the reactor. Watts Bar 1\nwas one of the most expensive units of the US nuclear program and its completion took 23 years.\nDespite the failure so far to build more reactors, the nuclear power industry remains highly\nsuccessful in two main areas, increased output from existing reactors and plant life extensions. Due\nto changes in the operating regimes and increased attention to reactor performance, the energy\navailability of US reactors has increased significantly from 56% in the 1980s to 78.3% in 2007. As\natesult, along with new capacity coming on line and reactor uprates, the output from US reactors\nhas tripled over this period. The lack of new reactor orders means that around 30% of the country’s\nreactors will have operated for at least 40 years by 2015. Originally it was envisaged that US\nreactors would operate for 40 years; however, projects are being developed and implemented to\nallow reactors to operate for up to 60 years. As of July 2009, 54 US nuclear plants had been\ngranted a life extension license by the Nuclear Regulatory Commission, 16 applications are under\nreview and around 21 have submitted letters of intent covering a period up to 20177\".\n\nThe election of George W. Bush in 2000 was expecied to herald a new era of support for nuclear\npower, The administration’s National Energy Policy set a target of two new reactors to be built by\n2010, but this objective will not be met. To reduce uncertainties regarding new construction a two-\nstage license process has been developed. This will enable designs of reactors to receive generic\napproval and utilities will then only have to apply for a combined Construction and Operation\nLicense (COL), which does not involve questioning of the reactors’ designs.\n\nAs of July 2009, the US Nuclear Regulatory Commission had received 17 applications for a total of\n26 units.” These applications cover five different reactor designs, GE-Hitachi’s Advanced Boiling\nWater Reactor (ABWR) and Economic Simplified Boiling Water Reactor ESBWR), Mitsubishi’s\nAdvanced Pressurized Water Reactor (APWR), AREVA NP’s Evolutionary Pressurized Water\nReactor (EPR) and Westinghouse’s AP-1000. Only one design — the ABWR, which is referenced\nonly in the application for South Texas units 3 and 4 — has been certified by the NRC, but this\ncertification runs out in 2012 and major modifications are likely to be needed for it to be re-\ncertified.\n\nDelays to the generic approval process have meant that the sequence of approval has been inverted\nwith utilities likely to be granted COLs before generic approval of the design of reactor to be built\nhas been granted,\n\nAs of July 2009, the NRC had granted three Early Site Permits (ESP) and received one\nadditional application’ that is currently under review. ESPs are independent of the\nconstruction/operating license.*™' None of the applicants has received an ESP and a certified design\nat this stage.\n\nThe July 2005 US Energy Policy Act was aimed at stimulating investment in new nuclear power\nplants. Measures include a tax credit on electricity generation, a loan guarantee of up to 80% of\ndebt (not including equity) or $18.5 billion for the first 6 GW, additional support in case of\nsignificant construction delays for up to six reactors and the extension of limited liability (Price\nAnderson Act) until 2025.\n\nBy the end of 2008, nuclear utilities had applied for $122 billion in loan guarantees and in May\n2009, the DOE short-listed four companies for the first group of loan guarantees: Southern Nuclear\nOperating Co. for two AP1000s at the Vogtle nuclear power plant site in Georgia, South Carolina\nElectric & Gas for two AP1000s at the Summer site in South Carolina, NRG Energy for two\nABWRs at the South Texas Project site in Texas, and Constellation for one EPR at the Calvert\nCliffs site in Maryland.

Grand Gulf was one of only three NRC approved Early Site\nPermits. A few days later Dominion pulled the plug on the ESBWR for its North Anna\nproject. In both cases some of the contracts for major components had already been signed.\nand have now to be cancelled.\"\n\n- Ameren announced that it would withdraw its EPR project at Callaway, Missouri, since the\ncurrent legislation “will not give us the financial and regulatory certainty we need to\ncomplete this project”\n\n- Exelon in March 2009 dropped the ESBWR for its Victoria project in Texas and chose the\nABWR instead. However, two months latcr, Exclon CEO John Rowe stated that his\ncompany would “delay or cancel” the project entirely, because it was not amongst the\nprojects selected by the DOE for loan guarantees.°*°\n\n- Progress Florida announced that its Levy County project would be delayed by a minimum\nof 20 months. The NRC will not accept groundwork until a pending COL request is\ndecided upon.??”\n\n- The Minnesota Senate voted by a majority of 50 to 16 to maintain the State’s ban on\nnuclear power.\n\n- President Obama has made a number of key appointments that are certainly not the first\nchoice of nuclear proponents. Steven Chu, an energy efficiency and renewable energy\nexpert, now heads the DOE. Carol Browner was appointed the President’s Special\nAssistant for Energy and Climate Change*® and Gregory Jaczko was named chairman of\nthe NRC. Before joining the NRC as a commissioner in 2005, Jaczko was a science advisor\nto Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid from Nevada. Reid has been fighting the Yucca\nMountain final disposal option for high-level waste for many years.\n\n- The attempt to introduce a $50 billion nuclear share in the US government’s Stimulus\nPackage was defeated by Congress. The fiscal year 2009 federal budget severely cut\nfunding for nuclear programs and de facto ended funding for Yucca Mountain.\n\n1V.3. Asia\n\nChina operates 11 reactors with a cumulated installed 8,438 MWe that generated 2.1% of the\ncountry’s electricity in 2008. According to the IAEA’s PRIS database there are an additional\n16 reactors under construction (although other sources suggest that this is on the high side).\nHowever, these two figures highlight the contradiction that is the Chinese nuclear program. Firstly,\nnuclear energy’s 2% contribution to the electricity supply translates into 0.8% of the country’s\noverall primary energy supply and is amongst the lowest percentage contributions in the world\n58 Platts, “Group goes to court over Summer reactor plans”, 22 May 2009,\n\n333 Entergy, “Entergy Temporarily Suspends Reactor License Applications”, Press Release, 9 January 2009.\n34 WNN, “Double Blow to ESBWR from Entergy and Dominion”, 12 January 2009.\n\n355 Ameren, “AmerenUE Requests Sponsors to Withdraw Missouri Clean and Renewable Energy\nConstruction Bills in General Assembly”, Press Release, 23 April 2009 ;\nhttp://ameren.mediaroom.com/index.php?s=43 &item=634.\n\n5° Platts, “Exelon to ‘delay or cancel’ plans for new reactors, CEO says”, 15 May 2009,\n\n357 Platts, “US NRC move to delay Florida units at least 20 months: Progress”, 1 May 2009.\n\n8 Fortune Magazine reports from a session of Fortune’s Brainstorm! on nuclear power: “While Enezgy\nSecretary Steven Chu might be open to new nukes, said one participant, speaking not for attribution, Carol\nBrowner, President Obama's special assistant for climate, decidedly is not, And Browner, this participant\nadded, is calling the shots.” Fortune Magazine, “A nuclear power renaissance? Maybe not.”, 22 April 2009.\n\n(with India and Pakistan), On the other hand, China has more reactors under construction than any\nother country in the world, with almost one third of the global total.\n\nChina’s energy demand is growing at apace, averaging between 5-10% per year over the past\ndecade and is heavily reliant on coal, which provides nearly 70% of the country’s energy. For\nsecurity of supply reasons and environmental concerns China has an active and ambitious plan to\nincrease energy efficiency (a 20% increase between 2005 and 2010) and to diversify energy\nsources. This is perceived as particularly important given the predicted increase in energy demand.\nMost notable has been the current and proposed expansion of the wind sector, which by 2007 had\nreached 5 GW installed capacity, a target that the National Development and Reform Committee\n(NDRC) had set for 2010. The 2020 target of 30 GW is now expected to be met by 2012. Industry\nobservers expected this target to be met easily, with some predicting that the installed capacity\nmight reach 100 GW by this date*’.\n\nPlans for the nuclear sector also entail major expansion. The current plan envisages nuclear power\nwill increase from the current level of 8.4GW to 40GW by 2020. This would require the\ncompletion of all of the 16 reactors under construction (15.2 GW) plus a further 15 or so over the\nnext 11 years. Various government departments have suggested that this target should be increased,\nincluding a call from the NDRC in May 2007 for 160 GW of nuclear by 2030 and a June 2008\nprojection from the China Electric Council for 60 GW by 2020 while the State National Energy\nAdministration was reported to be proposing a target of 70 GW by 2020. However, even such an\nambitious target would only enable nuclear energy’s contribution to the primary energy supply in\n2020 to reach 3%.\n\nWhile it is clear that the engineering skills and infrastructure and the energy demand as well as the\n‘command and control’ political system in China has made possible the completion of projects on a\nscale that may well be unachicvable in other parts of the world, the nuclear sector in China has not\nbeen without its problems. In particular, China has played, and continues to play, a careful\nbalancing act, needing the state of the art nuclear technologies from abroad and striving for self-\nsufficiency for manufacturing.\n\nThe eleven reactors in operation in China have been built with a mixture of foreign and indigenous\nresources, The Daya Bay and Lingao plants were constructed using French light water reactor\ndesigns. Those at Qinshan, phase 3, are Candu 6 pressurized heavy water reactors, while those at\nTianwan, phase 1, are of the AES-91 design supplied by Russia. The other reactors have been built\nusing domestic design and resources, although key components, such as pressure vessels, have\nbeen imported in some instances (such as at Qinshan, phase 1).\n\nThe desire to obtain new reactor designs is also being pursued for the next generation of reactors.\nTn late 2004 the State Council approved plans for the construction of up to eight new units at\nSanmen and Yangjiang. Three bids were received from Westinghouse (US), AREVA (France) and.\nAtomstroyexport (Russia). Bids were said to be assessed on the level of technology, the degree to\nwhich it is proven, price, local content, and technology transfer.”\n\nThe last two points are crucial. China has masterfully negotiated contracts in the past. The French\nlost a significant amount of money in the first reactor deliveries at Daya Bay, Guandong: “We did\nnot lose the shirt but cuff-links” in the deal, the EDF President stated at the time. “Yes, and golden\nones!” the Director General added during the press conference in 1985 when the deal was\nannounced. EDF managed the construction of the two units together with Chinese engineers. At the\ntime, the project was meant to be a door-opener for a whole series of reactors to be delivered. In\nreality, AREVA exported just two more units to China over the following 20-year period.\n\nThe contracts were not allocated to foreign bidders in 2005 as planned. Westinghouse won the\nbattle against AREVA for four units of Generation III design and signed a contract in February\n2007. Although the specific terms were not disclosed, the contract was said to be worth around\n$5.3 billion. Construction was expected to start in 2009 with power production in August 2013.\n339 Junfeng Li, “China’s Wind Power Development Exceeds Expectations”, OPINION, World Watch\nInstitute, 2 June 2008,\n\n*° At http://www _uic.com.aw/nip68.htm .\n\nOne of the key factors in the contract was that it contained not only technology transfer for the\nreactor but for the back end services.\n\nHowever, not to be outdone, on 26 November 2007 AREVA announced the signing of a “record\ncontract, worth 8 billion euros (...) unprecedented in the world nuclear market”. AREVA will build\ntogether with the CGNPC (China Guangdong Nuclear Power Corp.) two EPRs in Taishan in\nGuangdong province and will provide “all the materials and services required to operate them”!\nIn October 2008 AREVA and the China Guangdong Nuclear Power Holding Co. Ltd.\n(CGNPC) announced a joint venture with a 45%/55% split between the two companies to enable\nthe development of EPRs and other light water reactors in China and abroad.\n\nCo-operation agreements have been signed with other reactor suppliers, including with AECL of\nCanada (in September 2005), while the Korean Doosan Heavy Industry has supplied a pressure\nvessel for the Qinshan reactor and is expected to supply pressure vessels for the AP1000. A\nmemorandum of understanding has also been signed for co-operation on the pebble bed reactor\nwith South African bodies.\n\nTn addition to the agreements for reactor development there are a number of partnership agreements\nfor the supply of uranium. These have included deals with companies from Australia, Canada,\nKazakhstan and France.\n\nIndia operates 17 reactors with a total capacity of 3,779 MW that provide just 2% of its electricity\n(down from 3.3% in 2003). Total power generating capacity in India is about 130 GW — 10% more\nthan France — for a country with 20 times the population of France. Less than 3% of the installed\ncapacity is nuclear.\n\nIndia lists six units as under construction (two less than in 2004) with a total of only 2.9 GW. The\ncurrent operating reactors are also mainly of a smaller capacity, ranging from 90 to 200 MW, and\nmost experienced construction delays resulting in building times stretching over 10 to 14 years and\noperational targets seldom achieved. In 1985 India’s goal was 10 GW of operating nuclear\ncapacity installed by the year 2000—requiring a tenfold increase from the 1985 base. In reality,\ninstalled capacity rose to only 2.2 GW and its actual (operating) capacity by no more than 1.5 GW.\nIn 2006 the chairman of the Nuclear Power Corporation of India (NPCI) told reporters that 62\nreactors with a combined capacity of 40 GW would be operating by 2025.°” There is no evidence\nof how the country would enable an annual increase of 1,850 MW every year between 2008 and\n2025.\n\nIndia was the first country to clearly use designated “civil” facilities for military purposes. Its 1974\nnuclear weapons test triggered the end of most of the official foreign nuclear cooperation and\ninvaluable Canadian assistance in particular. The test series in 1998 came as a shock to the\ninternational community and triggered a new phase of instability in the region including a\nfollowing test series by Pakistan. Nevertheless, in July 2005, the Bush administration decided to lift\nthe nuclear trade sanctions against India and in a joint statement with the Indian Prime Minister the\nground was laid for a far reaching cooperation agreement.” The agreement was signed into law on\n8 October 2008 in spite of severe criticism in particular in the USA but also in many other\ncountries and in India itself.>“* The IAEA safeguards agreement with India was approved in August\n2008 and the Nuclear Suppliers Group (NSG)** granted an exception to its own rules on\n6 September 2008.

Foreign assistance could make a difference to some\nextent. However, a setback was the decision by the Australian government to maintain its embargo\nover uranium sales, despite the Nuclear Suppliers Group (NSG) waiver, unless India signs the Non-\nProliferation Treaty.\n\nJapan operates 53 reactors that in 2008 provided 24.9% of the country’s electricity. In 2002\nnuclear energy had produced almost 35% of Japan’s electricity. Two units at Hamaoka were\nofficially shut down definitively on 22 December 2008.** They had not produced any power since\n2001 and 2004 respectively. However, they were never listed in the IAEA’s “long term shut down”\ncategory and were taken off the operating reactors’ list only in January 2009.\n\nA massive falsification scandal starting in August 2002 led to the shut down of all of Tokyo\nElectric Power Company’s 17 nuclear reactors.“ Later the scandal widened to other nuclear\nutilities. No wonder that the nuclear electricity generation in the country dropped by over a quarter\nbetween 2002 and 2003 and the average load factor of the Japanese nuclear plants crashed to less\nthan 60%. The falsification of quality-control data re-surfaced in April 2009 when Hitachi detected\nthat inspection records for heat-welded pipes had been manipulated and launched an\ninvestigation.”\n\nOn 16 July 2007 a severe earthquake measuring 6.8 on the Richter scale hit the region that houses\nTEPCO’s Kashiwasaki-kariwa plant. The plant with seven units is the largest single nuclear power\nstation in the world. The reactors were shut down and have remained closed since for damage\nverification and repairs. Since the seismic acceleration of the quake detected at one of the reactors\nwas at least 2.5 times as high as the design basis of the nuclear facilities, it is unclear under what\nconditions the units can restart. When on 11 October 2007 the first vessel head was taken off unit\nseven for inspection, one control rod was stuck in the core and could not be moved. This means\nthat a key safety feature was not properly working. The discovery is likely to lead to additional\ndelays in the operation of the units. The capacity factor for the financial year ending 31 March\n2009 was again only 60%.\n\nIn February 2009 the Nuclear Safety Commission granted permission to restart unit seven,\nconsidered to be the least damaged on the site. On 5 March 2009 for the eighth time since operator\nTEPCO prepared for restart and Niigata Prefecture requested additional assurances for safety, a fire\nbroke out on the Kashiwasaki site. By 8 May 2009 the local authorities gave in to “intense pressure\nfrom TEPCO and the central government” and authorized restart of unit seven against significant\nprotests.** 1 The fate of the other Kashiwasaki units remains uncertain.\n\n346 WNN, “Money no object for Indian reactor plans”, 25 March 2009.\n\n7 Thidem,\n\n+8 Chubu Electric, Press Release, 22 December 2008.\n\n3 See also http://cnic.jp/english/newsletter/nit92/nit92articles/nit92coverup.html.\n\n350 WNN, “Data falsification prompts component checks”, 14 April 2009.\n\n35!

The Monju\nreactor is still considered to be in “long term shutdown”. Further construction plans are vague and\nhave been scaled back several times. Construction starts at Ohma, Fukushima and Higashidori have\nbeen delayed again by at least one year. Toshiba, which owns Westinghouse, has filed a record\n$3.6 billion deficit for the last financial year and has reduced planned investment by 42% for the\ncurrent financial year.>>?\n\nThe plutonium separation plant in Rokkasho-mura started active testing in March 2006, The\nreprocessing facility with a nominal annual throughput of 800% experienced its first technical\nproblems less than a month later (a leak in the cleaning tank for hulls and nozzles). The accidents\nand scandals of the last years have significantly delayed introduction of plutonium in MOX\n(uranium-plutonium mixed oxide) fuel. So far, no MOX fuel has been used, and Japan has a\nsignificant stock of plutonium, about 471, of which about 38t are in France and the UK. A\nshipment of MOX fuel fabricated in France and containing about 1.7 t of plutonium reached Japan\non 18 May 2009. The construction of Japan’s own MOX fuel fabrication facility, which is many\nyears behind schedule, is now supposed to start in November 2009. Additional seismic protection\nhas driven up the cost estimate again by 46% to, currently, $2 billion?\n\nPakistan™™ operates two reactors that provide 1.9% of the country’s electricity (down from 2.4%\nin 2003). One additional unit, supplied by China, is under construction. As in the Indian case,\nPakistan has used designated civil nuclear facilities for military purposes. In addition, the country\nhas developed a complex system to access components for its weapons program illegally on the\ninternational black market, including from various European sources.**? Immediately following\nIndia’s series of nuclear weapons tests in 1998, Pakistan also exploded several nuclear devices.\nInternational nuclear assistance has been practically impossible, given the fact that Pakistan, like\nIndia, has not signed the Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT) and does not accept full-scope safeguards\n{international inspections of aé/ nuclear activities in the country). The Pakistani nuclear program\nwill therefore most likely maintain its predominantly military character. The most recent crisis over\nthe security of Pakistan’s nuclear weapons in view of the positioning of militant Talibans close to\nPakistan’s capital is unlikely to help Pakistan waive basic NSG standard rules for international\nassistance and commerce as in the case of India,\n\nOn the Korean Peninsula, the Republic of South Korea (ROK) opcrates 20 reactors that provide\n35.6% of the country’s electricity (down from 40% in 2003). In addition five reactors are listed as\nunder construction, and work on a further two units will commence in 2009. For a long time, South\nKorea, besides China, has been considered the main future market for nuclear power expansion.\nWhile the early program was implemented without much public debate, a major controversy over\nthe future of the nuclear program — and in particular about the destiny of the radioactive waste —\nhit expansion plans in the 1990s and brought them virtually to a halt. The current government has\nreinvigorated nuclear projects and announced in December 2008 its plan to complete 12 more units\nby 2022 and thus raise installed nuclear capacity from the current 34% to 48% of total installed\ncapacity°*\n\nThe Democratic People’s Republic of Korea (DPRK) does not have any nuclear power reactors\noperating. A 1994 international agreement (KEDO) provided for the construction of two power\nreactors with financial and technical assistance from the USA, the EU and a number of other\ncountries. In return the DPRK was to have abandoned all nuclear weapons related research and\ndevelopment activity. In 2002 the USA accused the DPRK of violating the agreement. Although\n3 AFP, “Toshiba to raise $5bin: reports”, 18 April 2009\n\n353 Bloomberg, “Seismic Work on Japan Spent-Nuclear fuel Plant Boosts Costs 46%”, 16 April 2009.\n\n354 For details on Pakistan’s energy and nuclear program, see Zia Mian, Abdul H.

As a consequence, the reactor\nbuilding project was frozen. On 7 October 2006, the country exploded a nuclear device to\ndemonstrate its nuclear weapons capability. After an intensive round of disarmament talks, the\ncountry on 13 February 2007 signed the “North Korea - Denuclearization Action Plan” and agreed\nto “shut down and seal for the purpose of eventual abandonment the Yongbyon nuclear facility,\nincluding the reprocessing facility and invite back IAEA personnel to conduct all necessary\nmonitoring and verifications” as agreed between IAEA and the DPRK.*” Beginning in 2008\nseveral activities concerning the potential reactivation of its nuclear weapons and ballistic missile\nrelated activities raised severe doubts about the DPRK’s willingness to go down the disarmament\nroute, and in May 2009, it exploded another test weapon. In any case, there is no discussion any\nmore over the completion of the two power reactors that were under construction under previous\ninternational agreements.\n\nTaiwan operates six reactors that provide 19% of the country’s electricity (down from 21.5% in\n2003). Two 1350 MWe Advanced Boiling Water Reactors are listed under construction at\nLungmen, near Taipei. They were scheduled for start-up in 2006-2007, but this has been delayed to\nno earlier than 2011-2012. The most recent operating unit started up in 1985. All of the power\nplants are US-delivered. For the two plants under construction, initial bids to supply the units on a\nturnkey basis were rejected, and contracts were awarded to General Electric for the nuclear islands,\nMitsubishi for the turbines and others for the remaining equipment. Construction began in 1999.\n“When the two reactors were one third complete a new cabinet cancelled the project but work\nresumed the following year after legal appeal and a government resolution in favour”.*** In March\n2009 state utility Taipower told the parliament that it would need additional funding of US$ 1.1-1.5\nbillion to finish the two units five years late by 2012. The additional funding would bring the total\ncost of the two units to US$ 7.8-8.1 billion *°\n\n1V.4. Europe\n\nOn 1* August 2009, 15 of the 27 countries in the enlarged European Union (EU27) operated\n144 reactors, about one third of the units in the world, down from 177 reactors in 1989.\n\nThe vast majority of the facilities, 124 (down from 132 in 2003), are located in eight of the western\nEU15 countries and only 20 are in the seven new Member States with nuclear power. In other\nwords, almost nine out of ten operating EU27 nuclear reactors are in the West. Nevertheless,\nespecially when it comes to safety issues, a large part of the public and political attention seems to\nbe directed towards the East.\n\nIn 2008, nuclear power produced 28% (down from 31% in 2003) of the commercial electricity in\nthe EU. Moreover, almost half (47%) of the nuclear electricity in the EU27 was generated by one\ncountry only: France.\n\n357 At http //www.fmpre.gov.cn/eng/zxxx/t297463.htm .\n\n358 At http://www .world-nuclear.org/info/infl15_taiwan.html .\n\n35° WNN, “Taipower: More money to complete Lungmen”, 12 March 2009,\n\nGraph 16\nwe Nuclear Reactors & Net Operating Capacity in the EU27 humor of\n160 In GWe, from 1956 to 13t August 2009 200\n126 GWe 469 reactors\n131 GW\n477 reactors ~% 1 Maree |\n| | HAART 160\n420 |\n4140\n= Roactors tn operation | 420\n—Oporable capacity\n89 y——— — { 400\n| Hi HAH H 80\nTO | 60\n40\n| | | 40\nCUA\n20\nool ll |\n° nani A rrtiil °\n2 2 2 2 29 22 2\n8 a & Ey a a 838 3\n2 2 2 e 23 eR a\n© Mycle Schneider Consulting Source: IAEA-PRIS, MSC, August 2009\nIV.4.1. Nuclear Power in Western Europe\nEspecially in Western Europe, the public generally overestimates the significance of electricity in\nthe overall energy picture and the role of nuclear power in particular. The share of electricity in the\ncommercial primary energy consumption in the EU15 corresponds to only about one fifth.\nThe 124 operating nuclear power reactors in the EU15 as of 1\" August 2009 — that is 33 units less\nthan in 1988-89 when the number of operating units peaked — provide:\n+ less than one third of the commercial electricity production;\n+ about 12% of commercial primary energy consumption;\n+ less than 6% of final energy consumption.\nTwo reactors are currently under construction in the EU15, one in Finland and one in France. No\nbuilding site had been opened in the EU15 since the French Civaux-2 unit got underway in 1991.\nApart from the French exception, until the recent reactor project in Finland, no new reactor order\nhad been placed in Western Europe since 1980 — that is one order outside France in 29 years.\nThe following chapter gives a short overview per country {in alphabetical order).\nBelgium operates seven reactors and has with 53.8% (down from 55.5% in 2003) one of the\nhighest nuclear shares in its power mix in the world. In 2002, Belgium passed nuclear phase-out\nlegislation that required the shut-down of the nuclear power plants after 40 years of operation and\ntherefore, according to their start-up date, the plants will be shut-down between 2014 and 2025.\nAlthough the legislation was passed under a government that included a coalition with the Green\nParty, the governments that followed, which did not include any green ministers, have not\noverturned the phase-out law.\nFinland currently operates four units that supply 29.7% (up from 27% in 2003) of its electricity. In\nDecember 2003, Finland became the first country to order a new nuclear reactor in Western Europe\nin 15 years. The utility TVO signed a turn-key contract with the Franco-German consortium\n\nFramatome-ANP, now AREVA NP (66% AREVA, 34% Siemens) to supply a 1600 MW EPR\n(European Pressurized water Reactor). Construction started in August 2005. Three and a half years\nlater the project is over three years behind schedule and at least 55% over budget, the loss for the\nprovider being estimated at €1.7 billion (see chapter III. for further economic analysis). It remains\nunclear who will cover the additional cost.\nIn an unusually critical report the Finnish Safety Authority (STUK) pinned down a number of\nreasons for the delays:\nThe time and resources needed for the detailed design of the OL3 unit was clearly\nunderestimated, when the overall schedule was agreed upon (...). An additional\nproblem arose from the fact that the supplier was not sufficiently familiar with the\nFinnish practises at the beginning of the project. (...) The major problems involve\nproject management (...). The power plant vendor has selected subcontractors with no\nprior experience in nuclear power plant construction to implement the project. These\nsubcontractors have not received sufficient guidance and supervision to ensure smooth\nprogress of their work (...). As another example, the group monitored manufacturing\nof the reactor containment steel liner. The function of the steel liner is to ensure the\nleak-tightness of the containment and thus prevent any leaks of radioactive substances\ninto the environment even in case of reactor damage. The selection and supervision of\nthe liner manufacturer was left to the subcontractor who designed the liner and\nsupplied it to FANP [AREVA NP]. The manufacturer had no earlier experience on\nmanufacturing equipment for nuclear power plants. Requirements concerning quality\nand construction supervision were a surprise to the manufacturer (28\nAlmost three years later, nothing seems to be solved. In December 2008, the Director General of\nSTUK, Jukka Laaksoncn, sent a Ictter to the CEO of AREVA expressing “great concern” about\n“Qlkiluoto-3 NPP automation”. He stated:\nThe construction of Olkiluoto 3 plant seems to proceed generally well but I cannot see\nreal progress being made in the design of the control and protection systems. Without\na proper design that meets the basic principles of nuclear safety, and is consistently\nand transparently derived from the concept presented as an annex to the construction\nlicense application, I see no possibility to approve these important systems for\ninstallation. This would mean that the construction will come to a halt and it is not\npossible to start commissioning tests.\nThis is not the latest episode in a long series of events around the construction of OL3 (see Annex 4\nfor a chronology). In May 2009 STUK ordered the halt of welding work in France on primary\ncircuit piping because for the second time faults have been discovered. STUK section head Martti\nVilpas commented: “Things cannot continue like this”\nThe repeated construction delays of OL3 are not only a blow to power planning by the utility and\nthe some 60 large customers that are involved in the project consortium, but also for the Finnish\ngovernment. OL3 was part of the Finnish government’s strategy to achieve its target of 0% increase\nof 1990 emissions under the Kyoto Protocol. In 2006 Finland was 13% higher than in 1990. The\nlack of an operational OL3 will force Finland to use expensive flexible Kyoto mechanisms in order\nto compensate for emissions in the country.\nThe trouble with the OL3 project has not prevented TVO from filing an application, in April 2008,\nfor a decision-in-principle on OLA, a 1-1.8 GW reactor that should start construction in 2012 and\n36 STUK, Press Release, 12 July 2006, http:/Avww.stuk.fi/stuk/tiedotteet/2006/en_GB/news_419/ ; STUK,\n“Management of Safety Requirements in Subcontracting During the Olkiluoto-3 Nuclear Power Plant\nConstruction Phase”, Investigation Report 1/06, translation dated 1 September 2006.

Fennovoima Oy in January 2009 submitted an application to the Ministry of\nEmployment and the Economy for a decision-in-principle on the construction of a new plant at one\nof the following locations: Pyhajoki, Ruotsinpyhtéa or Simo. The EIA procedure concerning that\nproject ended in February 2009. However, none of these projects has been decided upon politically,\nnor have they developed to the level of a call for tender and the likelihood of their implementation\nis difficult to assess at this point.\n\nFinland is planning a final spent fuel repository also at the Olkiluoto site. In March 2009 the\noperator Posiva Oy submitted an application for a decision in principle to license an increase in the\nfinal disposal capacity from 6,000 tons to 12,000 tons in order to accommodate not only fuel from\nOlkiluoto-4 but also from Loviisa-3.°\n\nFrance is the worldwide exception in the nuclear sector. Thirty-five years ago, the French\nGovernment launched the world’s largest public nuclear power program as a response to the so-\ncalled oil crisis in 1973. However, less than 12% of France’s oil consumption in 1973 was used for\npower generation. Three decades later, France has reduced overall fossil fuel consumption (oil, gas,\ncoal) by less than 10% and the oil consumption in the transport sector has increased far more than\nthe annual consumption substituted by nuclear energy in the electricity sector. Per capita oil\nconsumption in France is higher than in Germany, Italy, the UK or in the EU27 on average.***\n\nIn 2008, the 59 French reactors produced 76.2% of the electricity (down from 77.7% in 2003),\nalthough only about 55% of its installed electricity generating capacity is nuclear. Entirely\nunnoticed by the French public, the oldest French reactor was definitively taken off the grid in\nMarch 2009. Neither the operators EDF and CEA nor the government thought it was necessary to\ninform anybody of the fact that the last operating breeder reactor, once the technology of the future,\nwas disconnected from the grid. A number of experiments are scheduled yet, before its final\nshutdown in November 2009.*”\n\nTn other words, France has a huge overcapacity that led to dumping electricity on neighboring\ncountries and stimulated the development of highly inefficient thermal-applications eleciricity. A\nhistorical winter peak-load of 92 GW is to be compared with an installed capacity of over 120 GW.\nEven a comfortable 20% reserve leaves a theoretical overcapacity, which is the equivalent of 20 of\nthe 34 units of 900 MW. No wonder that the equivalent of about 10 reactors operate for export and\nFrance still remains the only country in the world that operates over 40 units on load-following\nmode.\n\nOn the other hand, the electricity seasonal peak-load has exploded since the middle of the 1980s,\nmainly due to the widespread introduction of electric space and water heating. Roughly a quarter of\nFrench households heat with electricity, the most wasteful form of heat generation (because it\nresults in the loss of most of the primary energy in the transformation, transport and distribution\nprocess). The difference between the lowest load day in summer and the highest load day in winter\nis now over 60 GW. That is a very inefficient load curve, since significant capacitics have to be\nmade available for very short periods of time in winter. This type of consumption is not covered by\nnuclear power but either by fossil fuel plants or by expensive peak-load power imports. In 2008,\nFrance imported 19 TWh peak power from Germany for an unknown but probably high price. As a\n363 TVO, “Construction of a Nuclear Power Plant Unit at Olkiluoto - General Description - OLA”,\n\nAugust 2008.\n\n364 Ministry of Employment and the Economy, “Application to the MEE for a desion-in-principle on\nexpanding the spent nuclear fuel final disposal facility”, Press Release, 13 March 2009.\n\n36 For a detailed analysis of the French energy sector see Mycle Schneider, “Nuclear Power in France —\nBeyond the Myth”, commissioned by the Greens-EFA Group in the European Parliament, Brussels,\nDecember 2008; http:/Avww. greens-efa.org/cms/topics/rubrik/6/6659.energy@en.htm .\n\n* Essentially pressurized water reactors, 34 x 900 MW, 20 x 1300 MW and 4 x 1400 MW plus one 35-year-\nold 250 MW fast breeder reactor (Phénix, Marcoule) planned to be shut down later in 2009.\n\n357 ASN-Division Marseille, \"L’Autorité de sdreté nucléaire et 1’état de la stireté nucléaire et de la\nradioprotection en Languedoc-Roussillon en 2008\", undated.\n\nconsequence, the national utility EDF (Electricité de France) decided to reactivate 2,600 MW of\nvery old oil-fired power plants — the oldest one had originally been started up in 1968 — in order to\ncope with the peak load phenomenon.\nToday, per capita electricity consumption in France is over 25% higher than in Italy (which phased\nout nuclear energy after the Chernobyl accident in 1986) and 15% higher than the EU27 average.\nFrench per capita primary energy consumption is also significantly higher than, for example, in\nGermany.\nConsidering the existing overcapacities and the average age of about 25 years of its nuclear power\nplants, France does not need to build any new units for a long time. Other factors equally play in\nthat direction:\n+« The energy establishment has admitted privately for years that the country has gone too\nfar with its nuclear share in the overall power mix and that in the future, the nuclear\ncontribution should not exceed some 60% of the power production.\n«It is inconceivable that France will build new reactors with the sole aim of exporting\npower. That would be far too expensive especially in a liberalized energy market.\n+ EDF is intending to operate its reactors now for at least 40 years.\n« AREVA is in the course of starting up a centrifuge enrichment plant at Tricastin that\nreplaces the old gascous diffusion plant. That will save the power gencration cquivalent to\nthe output of three 900 MW reactors.\n¢ Many plants that will be shut down should not be replaced but made redundant.\nTherefore it will be many years, if not decades, before capacity constraints require new base load\npower plants in France. If the French government and EDF have decided to go ahead with the\nconstruction of a new unit, then this is because the nuclear industry faces a serious problem of\nmaintaining competence in the field (see chapter II).\nIn December 2007 EDF started construction of Flamanville-3. The FL3 construction site\nencountered problems of quality control on basic concrete and steel issues similar to those at the\nOL3 project that started two and a half years earlier. After repeated incidents in May 2008 the\nFrench Safety Authority (ASN) stopped the concreting on the site for several weeks. By the end of\nSeptember 2008, ASN still considered the organization “perfectible\". ASN inspectors had\ndiscovered that the documentation on welding \"does not allow the justification of conformity with\nthe referential\" >\nAt the end of October 2008 the nuclear safety authorities identified quality control problems at the\nbuilder AREVA. The Italian AREVA sub-contractor Societa delle Fucine had not applied the\nobligatory fabrication procedures. In May 2009 ASN rejected two out of three Societa delle Fucine\npressurizer forgings, which now have to be remanufactured.\nFinally, the problems are not only linked to the reactor project itself. The existing high power lines\nwould not be sufficient to export the electricity from the new plant. An additional line is in the\nplanning process and has encountered massive local opposition.\nThe two companies EDF and AREVA are in fierce competition to bring the first EPR online. EDF\ndid not appreciate AREVA's offering the Olkiluoto project as a turnkey facility, because for all\nprevious reactor projects EDF was responsible for overall construction oversight and AREVA's\nrole remained limited to manufacturing. In an unprecedented move, EDF felt obliged to put out a\npress release claiming that the Flamanville project is still on schedule, thus providing a firm\nrebuttal of a statement by AREVA CEO Anne Lauvergeon who had stated in a radio interview that\nthe project would be one year behind schedule. ASN sources claimed in May 2009 that\nFlamanville and Olkiluoto were merely several months apart.\n368 ASN, Letter to Director of Flamanville-3 construction project, 30 September 2008.\n3° EDF, Press Release, 12 November 2008.\n\nFrance also operates a large number of other nuclear facilities including uranium conversion and\nenrichment, fuel fabrication and plutonium facilities. France and the UK are the only countries in\nthe EU that separate plutonium from spent fuel, a procedure called reprocessing. France’s two La\nHague facilities are licensed to process 1,700 t of fuel per year. However, all the significant foreign\nclients have finished their contracts and have tured away from plutonium separation. The La\nHague operator AREVA NC therefore entirely depends on the domestic client EDF for future\nbusiness. In late 2008 both companies signed a long-term agreement for reprocessing and\nfabrication of MOX fuel until 2040.\n\nGermany operates 17 reactors that, according to the IAEA, provide 28.3% of the electricity in the\ncountry. However, the IAEA apparently takes into account only public electricity generation.\nGerman official sources indicate a nuclear share in the gross national power generation of only\n23.3%, in decline since 1997 when the nuclear share stood at 30%37\n\nTn 2002 the Parliament voted a nuclear phase out law that stipulates that the nuclear power plants in\nthe country have to be shut down after an average lifetime of about 32 years. However, the utilities\nhad a total “nuclear electricity generating budget” of 2,623 billion kWh (corresponding to the\nannual world nuclear power production) and can transfer remaining kWh from one reactor to\nanother unit. Two units have already been shut down under the phasc-out law (Stade, Obrighcim).\nA third unit (Miilheim-K4rlich) that had been under long-term shutdown since 1988 has been\nclosed for good. The construction of new nuclear plants and spent fuel reprocessing (beyond\nquantities of fuel shipped to reprocessing plants until 30 June 2005) is prohibited.\n\nAfter a significant crisis in the nuclear utility sector following a number of incidents at the\nBrunsbiittel and Kriimmel plants in June 2007, three top managers of the operator Vattenfall were\nsacked and the units underwent cxtensive reviews and upgrading. While Brunsbiittcl was still off\nline as of July 2009, the attempt to restart Kriimmel in early July 2009 failed due to new incidents.\nTwo other units have been shut down (Biblis A and B) since the beginning of 2007 “for\nmaintenance”. While Biblis-B restarted on 1 December 2007, Biblis-A remained shut down until\nFebruary 2008. It is speculated that the operator RWE has been prolonging the outage in order to\npush the planned final shutdown date of unit A beyond the next federal elections, scheduled for\nSeptember 2009, in the hope that a pro-nuclear government will overrule current phase-out\nlegislation.\n\nThe previously mentioned incident in July 2009 and further events at the Kriimmel plant near\nHamburg triggered not only safety concerns but also anger about the operator Vattenfall amongst\nthe population and politicians of all backgrounds. Although the technical problems (short-circuit in\ntransformer, fuel cladding failure) did not directly put into jeopardy the control of the reactor, the\nimpression that the operator simply does not master the facility in spite of the replacement of the\nmanager, has grown. An opinion poll showed that almost three quarters of the people polled were\nin favor of the immediate closure of aif older German nuclear power plants.*”!\n\nThe current “grand coalition” government between Christian Democrats and Social Democrats has\nconfirmed the phase-out legislation. While the Social Democrats have repeatedly reconfirmed their\ncommitment to the nuclear phase-out, the Christian Democrats are in favor of lifetime extension of\nexisting reactors but they are also opposed to the construction of new nuclear plants.°” According\nto the phase-out legislation and under current planning, the remaining 17 units will be shut down\nbetween 2010 and 2022. Within the next legislative period, which ends in 2013, seven reactors will\nhave to close.\n\n3” AG Energiebilanzen, “Energieverbrauch in Deutschland im Jahr 2008”, 20 February 2009.\n\n3 According to an Emnid-Poll commissioned by \"Bild am Sonntag\" 72 % of the people polled were in favor\nof the immediate shutdown of older nuclear power plants; Bild am Sonntag, 12 July 2009.\n\n3” CDU Secretary General has reconfirmed that position in February 2009; see CDU, “Wir wollen die\nLaufzeiten verlangem”, 25 February 2009, www.cdu.de/archiv/2370_25720.htm ; accessed 24 May 2009.\n\nWhile the nuclear lobby has not abandoned hopes of overturning the phase-out decision, no utility\nwould be willing to order a new plant. However, German utilities have demonstrated interest in\ninvesting in foreign projects, for example in France, the UK and Eastern Europe.\nIn a generally hostile public environment, nuclear power has no future in Germany. An April 2009\nopinion survey commissioned by the Federal Environment Ministry showed that 35% wish to\naccelerate the nuclear phase-out (+6% since 2005) while 31% agree to the current plan and 12%\nwant nuclear power to be abandoned at a slower pace. Only 18% (same as in 2005) think that\nGermany should not abandon nuclear power3”\nThe Netherlands operates a single, 36 year old 480 MW plant that provides 3.8% of the country’s\npower. The original political decision to close down the reactor by 2004 was successfully\noverturned in the courts by the operator. In June 2006 an agreement was reached between the\noperator and government that would allow operation of the reactor up to 2033 under certain\nconditions, “It would be maintained to the highest safety standards, and the stakeholders, Delta and\nEssent, agreed to donate EUR250 million towards sustainable energy projects. The government\nadded another EUR250 million, in the process avoiding the compensation claim it would have\nfaced had it continued towards early shutdown.’?”\nIn carly 2004, the Borssele operator EPZ extended a reprocessing contract with AREVA NC. This\nis a curious decision considering that there are no possibilities in the Netherlands of using separated\nplutonium. EPZ pays the French EDF instead to get rid of it.\nSpain operates eight reactors that provide 18.3% (down from 23.6% in 2003) of the electricity in\nthe country. Beyond the de-facto moratorium that has been in place for many years, the current\nSpanish Premier Jose Luis Zapatero made the nuclear phase out a part of his key government goals.\nZapatero announced at his swearing-in ceremony in April 2004 that his government would\n“gradually abandon” nuclear energy while increasing funding for renewable energy in an effort to\nreduce greenhouse gas emissions, in accordance with the Kyoto protocol. The first unit (José\nCabrera) was shut down at the end of 2006. Zapatero has confirmed the nuclear phase-out goal\nsince his reelection in 2008 and Industry Minister Miguel Sebastian stated: \"There will be no new\nnuclear plants.\"\"”° However, the Spanish Nuclear Safety Council (CSN) is currently reviewing\npotential lifetime extensions for existing facilities. The licenses of seven units will run out within\nZapatero’s current term. On 5 July 2009 the Spanish government extended the operating license of\nthe Garofa plant until 2013, while the safety authorities had approved an extension up to 2019.\nThe current government intends to put energy conservation first. \"Saving 20 percent would be the\nequivalent of doubling the number of nuclear power plants. It seems easier and cheaper to me,\"\nMiguel Sebastian said. “Furthermore, it (saving) is immediate, whereas nuclear plants take 15\nyears. There is no controversy, no waste or security problems, nothing,” he added.>” In addition, in\nrecent years Spain has turned into the world’s second largest operator of solar power capacity”\nand the third largest of wind power.\nSweden operates 10 reactors that provide 42% (down from 50% in 2003) of the electricity. Sweden\nhas one of the highest per capita power consumptions in the world. The main origin of this high\nconsumption level is the widespread, very inefficient thermal uses of electricity. Electric space\nheating and domestic hot water use represent about a quarter of the country’s power consumption.\n33 FORSA, “Meinungen zum Ausstieg aus der Atomkraft”, 23 April 2009.\n3% At http://www _world-nuclear.org/info/inf107.html .\na Reuters, “Spain insists on energy saving, not nuclear plants”, 21 January 2009.\n\nIbidem.\n377 Spain has connected to the grid 2,600 MW in 2008 alonc, which is equivalent to the total installed grid\nconnected photovoltaic capacity added that year in the rest of the world; see REN21, “Renewables Global\nStatus Report — 2009 Update”, Paris, 2009.\n\nSweden decided in a 1980 referendum to phase out nuclear power by 2010. The referendum was a\nsomewhat strange initiative since it took place when only six out of a program of 12 reactors were\noperating; the other six were still under construction. It was therefore a “program limitation” rather\nthan a “phase-out” referendum. Following the Chernobyl accident, Sweden pledged to phase out\ntwo units by 1995-6, but this early phase out was abandoned in early 1991. The country retained\nthe 2010 phase-out date until the middle of the 1990s, but an active debate on the country's nuclear\nfuture continued and led to a new inter-party deal: start the phase-out earlier but give up the 2010\ndeadline. Therefore the first reactor (Barseback-1) was shut down in 1999 and the second one\n(Barsebiack-2) went off-line in 2005.\nOn 5 February 2009 the conservative coalition government parties signed an agreement on energy\nand climate policy that defines some ambitious renewable energy and energy efficiency targets.\nThe agreement calls for the Nuclear Phase-Out Act to be scrapped and the prohibition on the\nconstruction of new nuclear power plants to be lifted. However, the implementation of the\nagreement implies fulfilling a number of significant conditions’:\n¢ The coalition parties only have a small 178/171 majority in parliament but need to change\nlegislation in order to allow new nuclear construction. The opposition parties, Social\nDemocrats, Green Party and Left Party remain firmly opposed to nuclear power and the\n2010 elections could bring the pro-nuclear coalition parties back to square one.\n* New plants can only be built once an existing plant is shut down. The maximum number of\noperating units thus shall not exceed ten as currently.\n* “Central government support for nuclear power, in the form of direct or indirect subsidies,\ncannot be assumed.”\n* The liability limits will be raised so that “reactor owners must take greater responsibility\nfor the risks of nuclear power”.\n¢ Ambitious targets for 2020 include 50% renewables in the primary energy balance, the\nincrease of efficiency by 20% and the annual generation of 30 TWh wind power. That\nleaves very little or no space for new nuclear power.\nThe United Kingdom operates 19 reactors (4 less than in 2003) that provide 13.4% (down from\n22% in 2003) of the country’s electricity. The first generation plants, the Magnox reactors, of\nwhich there were 11 stations have mostly been retired and the last two stations will close in the\nnext year or two. The seven second-generation stations, the Advanced Gas-cooled Reactors (AGR)\nate also near or at the end of their design life, although the owners now hope to extend their life to\n40 years so that the plants would be retired in the period 2016-2029. It remains to be seen whether\nthis plan is feasible. The AGRs have always had reliability problems and their operating costs are\nnow so high that it may be uneconomic to keep them in service even if the safety case can be made.\nThe newest plant is a Westinghouse PWR, completed in 1995.\nThe UK nuclear industry has gone through troublesome decades. Ever since Margaret Thatcher\nfailed in the first attempt at privatization in the late 1980s when the nuclear kWh turned out to be\ntwice as expensive as the market price for electricity, nuclear utilities and fuel industries have\nmoved between scandal and virtual bankruptcy. In September 2004, the European Commission\naccepted that a UK Government €11 billion restructuring package (for example, it took over the\ndecommissioning liability) to stop the privately owned nuclear generator British Energy from going\ninto liquidation was state aid but did not distort markets. The state-owned nuclear fuel and\ntechnology company, BNFL, was also effectively bankrupt because it could not meet its liabilities.\nThe government split the company into the physical ‘assets’ which were passed to a new agency,\nthe Nuclear Decommissioning Authority (NDA), while the capabilities were privatized, for\nexample, the reactor design and fuel manufacture division (mainly based on the Westinghouse\nnuclear division acquired in 1998) was re-privatized as Westinghouse and sold to Toshiba. The\nEuropean Commission again accepted that this was state aid (the liabilities of the technology\n378 Regeringskansliet, “A sustainable energy and climate policy for the environment, competitiveness and\nlong-term stability”, 5 February 2009.\n\ndivisions were being taken over by government) but this did not distort competition. The NDA is\nnow responsible for decommissioning all Britain’s civil nuclear facilities except those owned by\nBritish Energy, a liability estimated in 2007/08 to be in excess of £63bn (compared to £51bn a year\nearlier)?” The NDA inherited negligible funds for this task, relying partly, and increasingly, on\ngrants from the Treasury and partly on income from the facilities stilt in operation, including the\ntwo Magnox stations, the THORP reprocessing and the SMP plutonium fuel manufacturing plants.\nHowever, both of the latter facilities have been plagued by a number of very serious technical\nproblems that kept their operation significantly below expectations. A leak discovered at one of the\naccountancy tanks at the THORP facility in April 2005 that had gone unnoticed for about eight\nmonths resulted in a spill on the floor of a building of over 80 m} of dissolved fuel containing some\n22 tons of uranium and 200kg of plutonium. After two and a half years the plant has only\nreprocessed a test batch of 33 tons and a significant part of the plant remains closed. Another leak\ndetected at one of the evaporators in May 2009 could lead to the long-term or even permanent\nclosure of the plant.>*\n\nThe Sellafield MOX Plant or SMP has fared even worse. Since the plant opened in 2002, the plant\nhas produced a total of only 6.3t of mixed-oxide fuel. Its original annual production rate was\nreported to be 1201.7*\"\n\nIn 2004 the nuclear lobby in the UK launched a major initiative, widely reflected in the media, in\norder to keep the nuclear option open. However, key government ministers rebutted the claims in\nan unusually clear manner. “Building nuclear power stations would risk landing future generations\nwith ‘difficult' legacies”, then Environment Secretary, Margaret Beckett, stated.*°2\n\nHowever, in 2006, Tony Blair stated that “nuclear power is back on the agenda with a\nvengeance”,*** and the current Brown government seems to be willing to support the nuclear\noption. After Greenpeace’s legal challenge successfully undermined a first public consultation\nprocedure over the future of nuclear power in the UK, a second consultation ended on 10 October\n2007. However, it was considered equally inappropriate by a number of environmental and\nconsumer organizations, and Greenpeace filed an official complaint over the conduct of the process\nwith the Market Research Standards Board (MRSB), following its withdrawal along with other\nNGOs from the consultation a month earlier“ The government is being accused in particular of\nhaving made up its mind prior to the consultation process, essentially turning it into a farce, and of\ndistributing factually erroneous information.\n\nA confidential draft memo on energy policy for the Prime Minister by the Secretary of State for\nBusiness, Enterprise and Regulatory Reform curiously identified renewable energies as a threat to\nthe development of nuclear power through the weakening of the European emissions trading\nscheme: [Meeting the 20% renewables target] crucially undermines the scheme's credibility ... and\nreduces the incentives to invest in other low carbon technologies like nuclear power\", say the\npapers.**\n\nIn March 2006 the UK Government’s Sustainable Development Commission issued its report on\nnuclear energy and came up with the following conclusion***:\n\n5” at http/www_nda.gov. uk/documents/loader.cfn?url=/commonspot/security/getfile.cfm&pageid=21824 .\n38 CORE, “THORP — Living on a knife-edge.

In April 2009\nthe NDA auctioned off the first pieces of land earmarked for the construction of new reactors.\nFrench utility EDF*? and German companies E.ON and RWE were amongst the buyers.

The Government's National Policy Statement (NPS) on those\nproposed sites is scheduled for autumn 2009.\nPublic opinion remains split in the UK and while, in a 2007 European Commission sponsored poll,\n36% were in favour of increasing the share of nuclear energy in the EU 57% were in favour of\ndecreasing the role of nuclear power.*”? Meanwhile, an action group has been set up to fight plans\nto build a new plant at Layriggs Farm in Kirksanton. A private vote carried out by campaigners\nfound that 90% of villagers said they would leave Kirksanton if the nuclear power station were\nbuilt.\nA key plank of the government’s nuclear policy was its commitment that new nuclear power plants\nwould not need or be given subsidies, a claim that the utilities did not initially dispute. However, as\nestimated costs escalate, EDF was the first utility to break ranks suggesting that a minimum carbon\nprice would be required and also that targets for renewables would have to be reduced to allow\nnuclear plants to stay on base-load.?**\nThe only Non-EU Western European country that operates nuclear power plants is Switzerland. It\noperates five reactors that cover 39.2% of the country’s electricity consumption. In 2001 the\nresentment against nuclear power was at an all time high with 75% of the Swiss people responding\n“no” to the question “is nuclear power acceptable?\" In 2003 a majority of people rejected\nnevertheless two far-reaching motions against the further use of nuclear power. Switzerland is the\nonly nuclear country that repeatedly undertakes referenda over the future of nuclear power. While\n387 As early as 2006 EDF hired a powerful ally, Andrew Brown, the Prime Minister’s younger brother, who,\nas of May 2009, acts as press officer for EDF Energy.\n38 Platt’s David Stellfox in a February 2009, Washington DC presentation, put it this way: “How to resurrect\na flagging nuclear industry quickly — give it to the French!”\n3® Contract Journal, “Ten firms in race for £700m nuclear civils packages”, 20 May 2009.\n3 WNIN, “Westinghouse gets set for UK construction”, 5 September 2008.\n+!

Currently, the nuclear operators have\ninitiated a debate over the potential replacement of the country’s aging nuclear power plants.\nHowever, there are no short-term prospects for any new nuclear plants in Switzerland. Long-term\nobserver Conrad Brunner notes that utilities that in spring 2008 have introduced proposals for new\nnuclear power plants are “in for a long fight because neither the site decision is clear (...) nor the\neconomy of nuclear energy in the light of the Finnish example is clear”.>°\n\nIV.4.2. Nuclear Power in Central and Eastern Europe\n\nIn Bulgaria in 2008 nuclear power provided 32.9% of the country’s electricity. This is 10% down\nfrom the 2006 level as of December of that year. To fulfill the conditions for entry into the EU, the\nsecond two blocks of the Kozloduy power plant were closed. This follows the closure of the first\ntwo units at the end of 2002. The agreement for the closure of the four VVER 440-230 designed\nreactors, along with deals for similar vintage reactors in Lithuania and Slovakia, was made in 1999.\nBulgaria received €550 million from the EU as compensation for the closure. Two VVER 1000\nreactors remain in operation at the Kozloduy site. In 2003 the Government announced its intention\nto restart construction at the Belene site in Northern Bulgaria. Construction of a reactor began in\n1985 but following the political changes in 1989 construction was suspended and formally stopped\nin 1992, in part due to concerns about the geological stability of the site. In 2004 a call for tender\nfor the completion of the 2000 MW of nuclear capacity was made and scven firms initially\nexpressed an interest. However, all but two proposals, those involving the original VVER design,\none led by Skoda and one by Atomstroyexport (ASE) of Russia, were withdrawn. In October 2006\nthe ASE consortium, involving the French nuclear constructor AREVA and Bulgarian firms, was\nawarded the €4 billion contract.\n\nControversy remains over the completion of the Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA), which it\nis claimed does not contain adequate information on the seismic conditions, nor does it address the\npossibility of beyond design base accidents or give details of the potential impacts of\ndecommissioning” 7. Furthermore, following a legal action by environmental groups the authors of\nthe original EIA confirmed, in court, that it was flawed and that it would require a new EIA once a\ndesign and builder were appointed’. In February 2007 the Bulgarian authorities informed the\nEuropean Commission — as they are required to do under the Euratom Treaty — of the construction\nplans.\n\nA Belene construction consortium has been established in which the State utility Natsionalna\nElektriecheska Kompania (NEK) will retain overall control, with 51%, with the remaining shares\nhaving been put to tender. In late 2008 German utility RWE was announced as the strategic\ninvestor with a requirement to put up €1.275 billion as well as provide an €300 million loan in\nadvance. This led to the formation of the Belene Power Company in December 2008 as a joint\nventure. However, press reports suggest that RWE is unwilling to inject funds into the project prior\nto its completion, leading to a request for additional finance for the project from Russia”.\n\nThe new Bulgarian government that was voted into office in July 2009 might scrap the Belene\nproject altogether. Deputy Prime Minister Simeon Djankov, a former chief economist at the World\nBank who is also the new finance minister, declared that “there is an 80 percent chance that the\nBelene project will be stopped”. “?\n\n3°6 Conrad Brunner, “Switzerland — What’s Left from the Glaciers in the Alps”, in Lutz Mez, Mycle\nSchneider & Steve Thomas (eds), “International Perspectives on Energy Policy and the Role of Nuclear\nPower”, Multi-Science Publishing, Brentwood, 2009.\n\n37 Jan Haverkamp, “Comments on the non-technical summary of the EIA report of the Investment Proposal\nof the Belene Nuclear Power Plant”, Greenpeace, June 2004.\n\n38 Answers of the EIA team on question 29 by NGOs and citizens during the hearings on the Framework of\nthe EIA for Belene, 2004,\n\n399 Novinite, “Russia to Temporarily Finance Bulgaria Nuclear Plant Belene”, 24 March 2009;\nhittp:/Avww.novinite.com/view_news.php?id=102206 .\n\n©’ Bloomberg, \"Bulgaria May Cancel Nuclear-Plant Project, Sell Utility Shares\", 31 July 2009.\n\nThe Czech Republic has six Russian designed reactors in operation at two sites, Dukovany and\nTemelin. The former houses four VVER 440-213 reactors, while the latter two VVER 1000-320\nunits. Between them they produce 32.5% of the country’s electricity. The State utility CEZ has\nbecome a major importer and exporter of electricity and in 2007 it had a net export of around 16\nTWh (physical exchange), with significant exports to Austria, Germany and Slovakia*\"', This\nrepresents about two thirds of the nuclear generated electricity.\n\nThe Temelin nuclear power plant was the focus of considerable controversy since a decision was\ntaken to restart construction in the mid 1990s after construction was halted in 1989. The two\nreactors were eventually started in 2000 and 2002, with the financial assistance of the US Export-\nImport Bank and instrument and control technology supplied by Westinghouse. The involvement\nof Westinghouse at a relatively late stage of construction caused additional technical problems,\nleading to delays and cost over-runs. The International Energy Agency has suggested that “despite\nlow operating costs, amortizing Temelin’s costs (total cost: CZK99 billion [€2991 3.1 billion], plus\nCZK10 billion [€299, 313 million] of unamortized interest) will create a significant financial burden\nfor CEZ”.“?\n\nEven after the reactors began operating the controversy did not stop, as technical problems,\nespecially those relating to the uniquely large turbines, have caused a number of unplanned\noutages. The turbine problems as well as additional difficulties over the deformation of the fuel\nelements have resulted in lower lifetime plant availability. In 2007, unit 1 had a capacity factor of\n64% and unit 2, 74%, compared to a global average of 82%.\n\nIn July 2008 CEZ announced a plan to build two more reactors at Temelin, with construction to\nstart in 2013 and commissioning the first unit in 2020. However, planning is vague at best, at this\npoint. The Czech government is split on the nuclear question, the industry minister favoring nuclear\npower and the Green Party chairman and minister of the environment opposing nuclear power.\n\nThe Dukovany plants have operated since the first half of the 1980s and have been the subject of\nengineering changes to extend the life of the reactors while simultaneously expanding their output,\nby about 15%. It is envisaged by the operators that the power plant will continue operating until\n2025.\n\nThere is one nuclear power plant operating in Hungary at Paks, which houses four VVER 440-213\nreactors providing 37.2% of the country’s electricity. The reactors started commercial operation in\nthe early [980s and have been the subject of engineering works to make possible their operation for\nup to 50 years accompanied by a 20% increase in capacity. In April 2003 the second reactor at the\nsite experienced the country’s worst ever nuclear accident, rated on the International Nuclear Event\nScale (INES) as a \"serious incident\", which resulted in the evacuation of the main reactor hall and\nthe venting of radioactivity into the outside environment. It later transpired that the accident was\ncaused by inadequate cooling of the fuel rods during cleaning in a special container, leading to their\noverheating and the damage of the majority of the 30 fuel elements. The reactor was out of\noperation for 18 months.\n\nTn 1998 the operator of Paks proposed building additional nuclear capacity, but this was rejected by\nthe national utility MVM. However, in March 2009 the Parliament approved the Government\nproposal for the construction of additional reactors that would double the capacity of Paks. No\nindustrial plans or projections are known at this point and financing remains a key issue.\n\nThe Ignalina nuclear power plant in Lithuania is the only RBMK design still in operation outside\nRussia. Given the impact that the Chernobyl accident had across Western Europe, it is remarkable\nthat a similar design of reactor has been allowed to operate within the European Union. As part of\n*!

The first unit was\nclosed in 2004. The justification for the long phase-out was the country’s dependency on the\nstations. Even after the closure of unit one in 2004, the power station was still responsible for over\n72.9% of the country’s electricity in 2008. This is because the power station is far too large for the\ncountry’s relatively small demand, as prior to the political changes in 1992 it provided electricity\nmainly to Russia. The dependency on one reactor for such a large percentage of electricity would\nbe highly risky from a security of supply perspective. In reality the country always had a very\nlarge, up to over 250%, overcapacity. Therefore the replacement of the Ignalina plant has always\nbeen more a political than a technical issue.\n\nIn February 2007 the Governments of the three Baltic States and Poland agreed in principle to\nbuild a new nuclear power plant at Ignalina. A parliamentary bill was passed in Lithuania in July\n2007 calling for its construction and completion by 2015. During the following two years various\npermutations of ownership structures and sizes of the proposed reactor(s) were put forward. The\nlatest, published in January 2009, calls for the construction of only one reactor, under the\nmanagement of a Lithuanian government-controlled company LEO Lt. In March 2009 the\nLithuanian President Valdas Adamkus stated that work on the new plaut would get underway\nbefore the end of 2009 and possibly as carly as the autumn. “By May we will have a business plan.\nBy the fall we can probably start work on digging the ground”, Adamkus said.‘ In 2007 the\nLithuanian government formed a national company LEO LT to finance the project together with\nthe other Baltic States and Poland. However, energy minister Arvydas Sekmokas stated: “I doubt\nLEO LT is capable of building the plant. None of the four countries involved have expertise to do\nso; therefore we need to get the strategic investor.\" Considering the fact that by the end of May\n2009 neither a strategic investor nor a call for tender had been announced and that financing issucs\nhave remained entirely in the dark, the start of the project in the short term is highly unlikely.\n\nThe Cernavoda nuclear power plant in Romania hosts the only Candu (Canadian designed)\nreactors in Europe. In 2008 they provided 17.5% of the electricity in the country. The power plant\nwas started under the regime of Nicolae Ceausescu and initially was to house five units.\nConstruction was started in 1980 on all the reactors, in part using funding from the Canadian\nExport Development Corporation, but this was scaled back in the early 1990s to focus on unit 1.\nEventually this was completed in £996 at an estimated cost of around US$2.2 billion and nearly a\ndecade late. The second unit, also completed with foreign financial assistance, a $140 million\nCanadian loan and a €223 million Euratom loan, was connected to the grid in August 2007 - after\n27 years of construction. Plans are being actively developed to complete two additional units at the\npower plant. Bids have been solicited to create an independent power producer between the utility,\nSNN, which will complete and provide operation and maintenance, and a private investor. In 2008,\nfollowing protracted negotiations, the government decided that SNN would take 51% equity and\nprovide funding of €1 billion in loans and loan guarantees. Other funds would be internal and from\npartial privatizing of SNN in 2011. In November 2008 an investment agreement was signed\nbetween SNN and ENEL (Italy), CEZ (Czech Republic), GDF Suez (France), RWE Power\n(Germany) each holding 9.15%, Iberdrola (Spain) and ArcelorMittal Galati (Romania) both having\n6.2%. Initially, commissioning of unit 3 was due in October 2014 and unit 4 in mid 2015.\nHowever, this has now been revised and the first unit is not expected to be completed until 2016 at\nthe earliest.\n\nThe state utility Slovenske Elektrarne (SE) operates all the nuclear power plants in Slovakia at two\nsites: Bohunice, which houses two VVER 440 units, and Mochovee, which operates two similar\nreactors, There were two other reactors at Bohunice but these were the older VVER 440 230 design\nand were closed in 2006 and 2008 as part of the EU accession partnership agreement. The\n“3 Barth Times, “Lithuanian president says work on nuclear plant to begin 2009”, 27 March 2009.\n\n‘* Reuters, “Lithuania to seek strategic investor for n-plant”, 12 March 2009\n\nremaining units were subject to engineering works to extend their operating lives to 40 years,\nwhich would enable the station to operate until 2025.\n\nThe Mochovee units were completed in 1998 and 1999. They were to have been the first reactors to\nreceive funding from the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD) in 1995.\nHowever in the week before a, expected to be, positive decision by the Bank’s board of directors,\nthe Slovakian authorities withdrew the loan application. It was said that the withdrawal was due to\nthe financial conditions and overall price of the project (€1.2 billion), At the time the Slovak\nGovernment said it would be completed at a lower cost using solely Russian and Slovak\nengineering. The reactors were officially 90% and 75% complete and the new completion cost was\nsaid to be on the order of €800 million. However, when finally completed the cost was estimated to\nbe around double that amount.\n\nIn October 2004 the Italian utility ENEL acquired 66% of SE. As part of its bid ENEL proposed to\ninvest nearly €2 billion in new generating capacity, including the completion of the third and fourth\nblocks of Mochovee. In February 2007, SE announced that it was proceeding with the completion\nof these units and that ENEL had agreed to invest €1.8 billion. Although the European Commission\ngave its permission for construction to restart in July 2008, it noted that the reactor did not have a\n\"full containment” structure which is used in the most recent construction of nuclear power plants\nplanned or under way in Europe and they requested that the investor and national authorities\nimplement additional features to withstand an impact from a small aircraft’,\n\nDespite pressure from the Slovak Government it took until June 2009 to reactivate construction.\nThe two units are now scheduled for completion in 2012 and 2013 respectively.\n\nThe Krsko nuclear power plant in Slovenia is the world’s first reactor to be jointly owned by two\ncountries — Croatia and Slovenia. The reactor is a 700 MW Westinghouse PWR and was ordered\nby the former Yugoslavia and provided 41.7% of Slovenia’s electricity in 2008. It was connected to\nthe grid in 1981 and is due to operate until 2021. The output is shared between the two countries.\nDiscussions remain ongoing for the potential construction of a second reactor at the site without\nany short-term perspective.\n\nIV.5. Russia and the Former Soviet Union\n\nArmenia has one remaining reactor (Armenia-2) at the Medzamor nuclear power plant, which is\nsituated within 30 km of the capital Yerevan. In 2008 it generated 39.4% of the country’s power.\nThe reactor is of early Soviet design, a VVER 440-230, and has raised considerable safety\nconcerns. In 1995 a US Department of Energy document stated: “In the event of a serious accident,\nhowever, the reactor’s lack of a containment and proximity to Yerevan could wreak havoc with the\nlives of millions“. Due to its proximity to the capital a referendum was held in 1988, which\nresulted in an agreement to close the then two operating VVER 440-230 reactors. In December\n1988 Armenia suffered a major earthquake which killed around 25 000 people and led to the rapid\nclosure of the reactors in March 1989. During the early 1990s and following the collapse of the\nformer Soviet Union, a territorial dispute between Armenia and Azerbaijan resulted in an energy\nblockade against Armenia. This led to significant power shortages and in 1993 the Government\ndecided to re-open Unit 2, the younger of the two units. The reactor is due to close in 2016. In\nSeptember 2007 the Minister of Energy called for a new reactor to be built at Medzamor, with an\nanticipated construction cost of $2 billion and a construction time of four and a half years. More\nrecently, in February 2009, the Government announced a tender to build a 1000 MW unit with an\nexpected cost of around $5 billion.\n\n“5 European Commission, “Commission issues its opinion on units 3 and 4 of the Slovak Nuclear Power\nPlant of Mochovee”, IP/08/1143, 15 July 2008.\n\n“6 DOE, \"Most Dangerous Reactors - A worldwide compendium of reactor Risk”, US Department of\nEnergy, Office on Energy Intelligence, May 1995.\n\nKazakhstan had just one fast breeder reactor in operation at Aktau, the BN 350, which, in 1973,\nwas the world’s first commercial fast breeder reactor. It was closed down in 1999, having been\nused to generate power, heat and for desalination. There are a wide range of proposals for the\nfurther use of nuclear power, ranging from further breeder reactors, to larger light water reactors, to\nup to 20 smaller reactors deployed in towns across the country. The plans seem to mainly involve\nRussian or Japanese technology but have not tumed into concrete projects.\n\nHowever, Kazakhstan’s main contribution to the global nuclear industry is its uranium production,\nas it has 15% of the world’s reserves. Uranium production has increased rapidly in the last decade,\nfrom 795 tons in 1997 to 6,637 tons in 2007, with plans for 30 000 tons by 2018. In order to meet\nthese objectives various co-operation agreements have been signed with companies and\ngovernment agencies from amongst others, Canada, China, France, Japan and Russia. These\nagreements are not restricted to uranium supply but also involve enrichment and fuel fabrication.\nThere are 31 operating reactors in Russia with a total installed capacity of 21.7 GW. In 2008 the\nnuclear fleet generated 152 TWh, providing 16.9% of the country’s electricity. The following\nreactors are in operation: 15 of the early design, four first generation VVER 440-230 and\n11 RBMK reactors; four small (11 MW) BWRs used for cogeneration in Siberia; one fast breeder;\nand 11 sccond gencration light water reactors (2 VVER 440-213 and 9 VVER 1000s). The average\nage of the reactors in operation is 27 years and only two have been completed in the last 10 years.\nThe last reactor was completed in 2004 at Kalinin.\n\nThere are nine reactors officially under construction, of which three were started over 20 years ago\n(Volgodonsk 2 [1983]; Kursk 5 [1985] and Kalinin 4 [1986]). The other reactors include one fast\nbreeder at Beloyask and two small PWRs (32 MW) — to be placed on barges. Two of the latest\nVVER 1200 reactors (the AEA 2006) are being built at Novovoronczh and Leningrad — where\nconstruction started in October 2008.\n\nOver the years the Government has announced a number of plans for the expansion of the nuclear\nsector. For example the plan in 2000 was that by 2010 over 200 TWh of nuclear electricity would\nbe generated. In October 2006 a US$55 billion nuclear energy development program was adopted.\nNearly half of this proposed program, $26 billion, was to come from the Federal budget, with the\nrest coming from the industry. In September 2007 the Government announced plans for the\nconstruction of an additional 8 VVER 1200 by 2016 with further reactors to be built after this,\nleading to a doubling of installed capacity by 2020. It is anticipated that the construction of 2 GW\nper year of new reactors will start after 2009. However, the recent global economic situation is\nparticularly affecting the Russian economy, due to the low price of oil and gas, and may once again.\nlead to the delay or cancellation of a number of nuclear projects.\n\nIn addition to expansion plans, the Russian industry is proposing to extend the operating lives of\nexisting reactors. In particular the RBMK reactors are now expected to operate for around 45 years.\nRussia is constructing more reactors for export than it is for its domestic market, with sales of the\nlatest design of the VVER 1000, the AES 91 and AES 92, in Bulgaria, China and India. A number\nof other reactor designs are being developed, including smaller 300 MW BWRs.\n\nRussia has developed the whole nuclear fuel chain. Russian uranium resources are around 10% of\nthe world’s reasonably assured resources plus inferred resources according to the Nuclear Energy\nAgency, with the largest mines close to the Chinese/Mongolian border. Exploration expenditure\nhas nearly doubled in two years to about US$ 52 million in 2008. Plans are also being proposed to\ndevelop mining reserves in a number of countries, through the formation of the Uranium Mining\nCompany (UGRK) in conjunction with Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan and Mongolia. In September 2007\na deal was also signed with the Australian Government to import up to $1 billion worth of uranium\nper year. Joint ventures are also being developed for mining projects in Russia, such as with Japan's\nMitsui & Co, and in February 2009 Rosnedra published a list of deposits to be offered for tender in\n2009.\n\nFor many decades Russia has been involved in the supply of fresh fuel and the return of spent fuel\nto and from countries in Central and Eastern Europe. This practice has now largely ceased. Despite\n\nthe intention to increase the reprocessing of nuclear fuel, only the VVER 440 fuel is reprocessed,\nwith the VVER 1000 and RBMK fuel stored. The construction of the RT-2 plant at Krasnoyarsk,\nproposed for reprocessing of VVER 1000 fuel, was stopped. Furthermore, the RT-1 reprocessing\nlines at Mayak for the VVER 440 fuel are now operating at only one third capacity due to the loss\nof foreign contracts.\n\nUkraine has fifteen reactors in operation providing 47.4% of the country’s electricity in 2008. The\naccident at Chemobyl in 1986 not only did huge damage to the country’s economy, environment\nand public health, but it also stopped the development of nuclear power. This situation was further\nexacerbated when there was another accident at the Chernobyl station, in unit 2 in 1991. Since then\nthe two remaining units at Chernobyl have been closed and the station is now awaiting\ndecommissioning.\n\nSince 1986 three reactors have been completed, Zaporozhe 6, Khmelnitsky 2 and Rovno 4. The\nlatter two units were initially planned to be completed using financing from the EBRD and\nEuratom, but the project was withdrawn at the last moment by the Ukrainian Government claiming\nthat the costs and conditions for the loans were too high. The reactors were completed using\nUkrainian and Russian resources, but both reactors were later the recipients of much smaller Joans\nfrom both the EBRD and Euratom for ‘post completion’ upgrades.\n\nIn 2006 the Government approved a strategy that would lead to the doubling of nuclear installed\ncapacity by 2030. This would require both the replacement of existing units (between 9 to 11\nreactors totaling 10.5 GW) and a further 11 reactors for expanding capacity. The strategy envisages\ninitially the completion of the third and four units at Khmelnitsky with work commencing in 2010.\nDespite their apparent completion status (75% and 28%) the reactors are not expected to be\ncompleted until 2016 and 2017. The majority (85%) of the funding for the completion project is\nexpected to come from a Russian loan. Despite this an international tender was announced, but in\nthe end only Atomstroyexport and Korea HNP submitted tenders. The contract is due to be signed\nin 2009.\n\nThe identification of the other projects in the expansion plan and the ordering of new construction\nare expected to start in 2010,\n\nUkraine has some uranium reserves and is undertaking mining activities, in particular at Zholtye\nVody in the Dnepropetrovsk region. These activities provide about one third of the Ukrainian\nuranium needs. As of [ January 2007 uranium resources, recovered at mining cost less than 40\nUSD/kgU. Further sites are under active exploration and development using domestic resources,\nalthough plans exist to boost these activities using foreign investment with an objective of\nproduction doubling to about 1500 year by 2013.\n\nAnnex 1: Status of Nuclear Power in the World (1° August 2009)\nAge Construction”?
