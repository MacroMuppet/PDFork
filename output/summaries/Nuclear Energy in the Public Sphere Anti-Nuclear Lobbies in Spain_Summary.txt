General Summary
==================================================
The document discusses the role of the Spanish Atomic Forum in promoting and defending the nuclear power industry in Spain during the 1960s and 1970s. It highlights the efforts made by pro-nuclear lobbies to enhance the credibility and public acceptance of nuclear energy, including communication campaigns and information dissemination. The document also delves into the conflicts and divergences within the Spanish government regarding nuclear power development, as well as the specific objectives and evolution of the Forum over time. Additionally, it explores the Lemoniz incident and its impact on the anti-nuclear movements in the Basque Country and Catalonia, providing a deeper analysis of the conflict.

Main Conclusions and Findings
==================================================
- The relevance of conflicts and divergences within the Spanish Government reinforced the view proposed by technocrats.
- The development of the Spanish nuclear program was expanded based on research from De la Torre and Rubio (2013).
- Details of the electric companies involved in the nuclear sector were completed using data from Gomez Mendoza (2007) and Anes et al. (2001).
- The Lemoniz incident, the drafting of the second National Energy Plan, and the reaction of the Spanish Atomic Forum were described in detail.
- Insights from Lopez Romo's papers on the Lemoniz conflict deepened the analysis of the conflict and explored links between ETA and the anti-nuclear movement in the Basque Country.
- Understanding of the links between nationalist protest and anti-nuclear movements in the Basque Country and Catalonia was improved.
- Analysis of pro-nuclear and anti-nuclear discourses in leading newspapers helped in studying trends in Spanish public opinion during 1977 to 1979.
- The International Conference on the Peaceful Uses of Atomic Energy in 1955 was correctly named.
- The social make-up and regional diversity of the protest movement in Spain need to be included in a more detailed analysis.

Detailed Section Summaries
==================================================

- Relevance of conflicts and divergences within the Spanish Government
----------------------------------------------------------------------
The conflicts and divergences within the Spanish Government during the late 1950s were important in understanding the development of the nuclear program. The technocrats' proposals were supported by the JEN and private companies in response to the obstructionist attitude of the INI. Regional differences in Spain played a role in opposition to nuclear power, with protests in the Basque Country and Catalonia. The Lemoniz incident and the drafting of the second National Energy Plan were also significant, with links between ETA and the anti-nuclear movement explored. The in-fighting within the regime and the roles of key figures like Suanzes and Otero Navascués were crucial in the success of the change in orientation proposed by the technocrats. Studies on the history of the electrical companies involved, such as Iberdrola and Endesa, provide further insights into the development of the program.

- Development of the Spanish nuclear program
--------------------------------------------
The development of the Spanish nuclear program saw conflicts within the government, with technocrats advocating for foreign technology acquisition and private industry involvement. The shift towards commercial reactors reflected a global trend. In-fighting within the regime and the role of electrical companies, such as Iberdrola and Endesa, were key factors. The study aimed to analyze the nuclear industry's role amid growing anti-nuclear sentiment in the 1960s and 1970s, highlighting a lack of focus on industry actions. The "Nuclear Iron Triangle" in Spain involved government officials, nuclear experts, and private sector representatives. This collaboration shaped the development of nuclear power in Spain amidst increasing opposition.

- Electric companies involved in the nuclear sector
---------------------------------------------------
Electric companies involved in the nuclear sector faced challenges in obtaining project licenses in the early 1970s, with projects in Europe and Japan being withdrawn due to local opposition. National industrial associations supported nuclear power through communication campaigns emphasizing safety standards and the need for nuclear power during the energy crisis. Governments promoted the construction of nuclear power plants to reduce dependence on oil. The expansion of the nuclear industry led to the emergence of citizens' groups protesting against nuclear energy. Conflicts and divergences within the Spanish Government influenced the development of the Spanish nuclear program. The growth of anti-nuclear movements in the 1960s and 1970s brought the nuclear debate into the public arena, with various interest groups opposing nuclear energy. Nuclear industrial associations played a significant role in advocating for nuclear energy.

- Lemoniz incident
------------------
The Lemoniz incident in 1978 involved conflict surrounding the construction of the Leméniz Nuclear Power Plant in the Basque province of Vizcaya. Opposition from ETA, anti-nuclear organizations, and local committees highlighted concerns about safety and lack of operating licenses. The incident escalated with a bomb planted in the reactor by ETA, resulting in deaths and injuries. The incident caused delays in construction and sparked debate within the Basque anti-nuclear movement. The lack of references to the incident in Spanish Atomic Forum publications may suggest a deliberate effort to downplay the anti-nuclear movement. The section also explores conflicts within the Spanish government and the development of the nuclear program. The reviewer's contributions have greatly enhanced the understanding of these events.

- Nationalist protest and anti-nuclear movements in the Basque Country and Catalonia
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The anti-nuclear protests in Spain during the 1970s were closely linked to nationalist and pro-independence movements in regions like Catalonia, the Basque Country, and Galicia. These protests influenced the shaping and development of the movements, with nationalist movements using opposition to nuclear power plants as a tool to expand their presence in the public arena. In regions like the Basque Country and Navarra, protest actions began in 1974 against specific projects, leading to heated demonstrations and the withdrawal of power plant projects in various regions. The Francoist repressive system also affected the protest movement in Spain.
