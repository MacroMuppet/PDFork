Transportation and Emergency Control Center
-------------------------------------------
OST, or the Office of Secure Transportation, is responsible for safely transporting U.S. nuclear weapons and materials within the country using highly secure vehicles and armed Federal Agents. Since its establishment in 1975, OST has accumulated over 140 million miles of experience without any fatal accidents or releases of radioactive material. The Office of Systems Engineering and Integration plays a crucial role in managing the complex nuclear deterrence mission, ensuring safe and reliable deterrents through informed decision-making and risk assessment across NNSA's national laboratories, plants, and sites. This involves aligning stockpile activities with policy drivers to maintain the security provided by the nation's nuclear deterrent.

Safety and Security
-------------------
The Office of Secure Transportation (OST) is responsible for the safe and secure transport of U.S. nuclear weapons, components, and special nuclear materials within the contiguous United States. This classified cargo is transported in highly secure tractor-trailers and escorted by armed Federal Agents to ensure security and respond in case of emergencies. The OST plays a crucial role in ensuring the smooth operation of the nuclear security enterprise, allowing the National Nuclear Security Administration (NNSA) to deliver a reliable and militarily effective stockpile. NNSA collaborates with the Department of Defense (DoD) on the Nuclear Weapons Council to establish priorities and ensure national security. Supply chain risk management is also conducted to confirm the availability of critical supplies and prevent foreign subversion.

Law Enforcement and Emergency Management Liaison
------------------------------------------------
The section discusses the crucial role of the Office of Systems Engineering and Integration in managing the complex nuclear deterrence mission. This office is responsible for aligning stockpile activities with national policies and ensuring informed decision-making across the nuclear security enterprise. They engage with stakeholders, including the Department of Defense, to address military requirements for U.S. nuclear weapons. Additionally, they monitor the industrial base to ensure suppliers are viable and conduct supply chain risk management. With the global security environment indicating nuclear deterrence will remain important, NNSA is focusing on modernizing its stockpile and infrastructure to meet the challenges ahead.

Office of Secure Transportation History
---------------------------------------
The Office of Secure Transportation (OST) is responsible for the safe transport of U.S. nuclear weapons and materials, using highly secure tractor-trailers escorted by armed Federal Agents. OST has accumulated over 140 million miles of experience without any fatal accidents or releases of radioactive material. This history demonstrates the care taken to ensure the safety and security of nuclear weapons during transit.
