General Summary
==================================================
The document discusses the issue of fossil fuel subsidies, highlighting that while they aim to make energy more affordable for consumers, they often disproportionately benefit higher-income groups. The main goal is to provide insights for policymakers on how to move away from inefficient fossil fuel subsidies, as agreed upon at forums like COP and the G20. The document presents data on the scale and impact of fossil fuel subsidies, emphasizing the need to transition towards clean energy solutions. It also explores the implications of removing these subsidies for energy markets, government budgets, and climate change mitigation efforts.

Main Conclusions and Findings
==================================================
Key Conclusions and Findings:

1. Fossil fuel subsidies for consumers remain elevated compared to historical averages.
2. Many subsidies are poorly targeted and disproportionately benefit higher-income groups.
3. Distortions in the energy system favor incumbent fuels.
4. Governments, especially in emerging and developing economies, heavily subsidized fossil fuels in 2023, spending $620 billion.
5. In 2022, fossil fuel subsidies hit record levels, with subsidies for natural gas, electricity, and oil consumption increasing significantly.
6. Short-term affordability measures in response to the global energy crisis reached $900 billion by April 2023.
7. Removing inefficient fossil fuel subsidies could have a positive impact on energy markets, government budgets, and efforts to tackle climate change.

Key Takeaways:

1. Policy makers should consider pivoting away from inefficient fossil fuel subsidies to promote more efficient and equitable energy systems.
2. Addressing the disproportionate benefits of subsidies to higher-income groups is crucial for achieving fair and affordable energy transitions.
3. The scale and characteristics of fossil fuel subsidies highlight the need for targeted and effective policy interventions to promote sustainable energy practices.

Detailed Section Summaries
==================================================

- Share of GDP (MER)
--------------------
The section discusses the share of GDP (MER) spent on fossil fuel subsidies, highlighting that subsidies for consumers remain elevated compared to historical averages. Governments, especially in emerging and developing economies, heavily subsidized fossil fuel use in 2023, spending $620 billion, significantly more than the $70 billion spent on clean energy investments. The need to keep energy affordable has led to interventions to keep fuel and electricity prices low, with subsidies hitting record levels in 2022. The data and analysis provide insights for policymakers aiming to pivot away from inefficient fossil fuel subsidies to promote clean energy transitions.

- Key findings
--------------
The key findings from the section on fossil fuel subsidies include the fact that many subsidies are poorly targeted and disproportionately benefit higher-income groups. In 2023, governments continued to heavily subsidize the use of fossil fuels, spending $620 billion, significantly more than the $70 billion spent on support for clean energy investments. The need to keep energy affordable has led to interventions to keep fuel and electricity prices low, with expenditures reaching $900 billion by April 2023. Fossil fuel subsidies hit record levels in 2022, with subsidies for natural gas, electricity, and oil consumption increasing significantly. Removing inefficient fossil fuel subsidies could have a positive impact on energy markets, government budgets, and efforts to tackle climate change.

- Fossil fuel consumption subsidies, 2015-2023
----------------------------------------------
In 2023, governments in emerging and developing economies heavily subsidized fossil fuel consumption, spending $620 billion, significantly more than the $70 billion spent on clean energy investments. Global subsidies for fossil fuel consumption hit record levels in 2022, exceeding $1 trillion for the first time. The surge was due to disruptions in energy markets, with subsidies in 2022 double those of 2021 and almost five times higher than in 2020. The IEA advocates for removing or reducing fossil fuel subsidies, as they distort markets, widen fiscal deficits, and discourage the adoption of cleaner renewable energies.

- Fossil fuel subsidies hit record levels in 2022
-------------------------------------------------
In 2022, global subsidies for fossil fuel consumption exceeded $1 trillion for the first time due to disruptions in energy markets and the global energy crisis triggered by Russia's invasion of Ukraine. Governments, especially in emerging and developing economies, spent $620 billion on fossil fuel subsidies in 2023, far exceeding the $70 billion spent on clean energy investments. Fossil fuel subsidies disproportionately benefit higher-income groups and distort markets, sending the wrong price signals and widening fiscal deficits. The International Energy Agency advocates for the removal or reduction of these subsidies to promote cleaner renewable energies and address climate change. The IEA's analysis shows that removing inefficient fossil fuel subsidies could have positive impacts on energy markets, government budgets, and climate change efforts.

- Strategies for Affordable and Fair Clean Energy Transitions
-------------------------------------------------------------
In 2023, governments spent $620 billion on fossil fuel subsidies, significantly more than the $70 billion spent on clean energy investments. Fossil fuel subsidies disproportionately benefit higher-income groups and are poorly targeted. The need to keep energy affordable led to $900 billion in direct grants, vouchers, tax reductions, and price regulations during the global energy crisis. Removing inefficient fossil fuel subsidies could positively impact energy markets, government budgets, and efforts to tackle climate change. Fossil fuel subsidies hit record levels in 2022, with subsidies for natural gas, electricity, and oil consumption increasing. The total value of subsidies declined in 2023 due to some government provisions expiring and energy prices pulling back from record highs.
