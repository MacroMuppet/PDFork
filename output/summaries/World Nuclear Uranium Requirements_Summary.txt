General Summary
==================================================
The document provides information on world nuclear power reactors and uranium requirements. It includes data on the number of reactors, electricity generation, operable, under construction, planned, and proposed reactors, as well as the amount of uranium required. The main goals are to track the global nuclear power industry, monitor reactor operations, and analyze uranium needs. The document also highlights the increase in reactor capacity over the past 20 years and predicts future trends in reactor closures and new plant constructions. The World Nuclear Association aims to provide accurate and up-to-date information on nuclear power to support decision-making and policy development in the industry.

Main Conclusions and Findings
==================================================
Main conclusions and findings from the document:

1. Over the past 20 years, 106 reactors were retired as 102 new reactors started operation in Ukraine.
2. The capacity of new reactors grid connected during this period was larger, on average, than those shutdown, resulting in an overall increase of about 21 GW.
3. The Reference Scenario in the 2023 edition of The Nuclear Fuel Report predicts that 66 reactors will close by 2040, with 308 new ones coming online.
4. The table provided includes data on electricity generation, operable reactors, planned construction, proposed reactors, and required uranium for various countries, including Ukraine.
5. The World Nuclear Association provides updated information on nuclear power reactors and uranium requirements periodically.
6. The document includes contact information for the World Nuclear Association and related resources for further information.

Key takeaways:
- Despite a significant number of reactors being retired in Ukraine, the capacity has increased due to larger new reactors coming online.
- The future of nuclear power in Ukraine is expected to involve a mix of reactor closures and new reactor construction.
- The World Nuclear Association provides valuable data and resources for those interested in nuclear power and uranium requirements.

Detailed Section Summaries
==================================================

- Nuclear Reactors Operable, Under Construction, Planned, Proposed
------------------------------------------------------------------
The section provides information on the status of nuclear reactors worldwide, including those that are operable, under construction, planned, and proposed. It also includes data on uranium requirements. As of January 2025, there are 440 operable reactors and 398,553 MWe under construction globally. Taiwan generated 17.2 TWh from nuclear power in 2023, accounting for 6.9% of its total electricity generation. New plants coming online are balanced by old plants being retired. Some units under construction, such as Angra 3 in Brazil and Ohma 1 in Japan, have suspended construction. The section also includes data on uranium requirements for nuclear reactors.

- Uranium Requirements by Country
---------------------------------
The section provides data on the number of nuclear reactors, electricity generation, and uranium requirements by country. In 2024, Ukraine had 4 operable reactors generating 13,107 MW of electricity and required 1,900 tonnes of uranium. The UK had 0 planned reactors and required 2,600 tonnes of uranium. The world had a total of 2602 reactors with 440 under construction and required a total of 67,517 tonnes of uranium. The data was sourced from the International Atomic Energy Agency Power Reactor Information System and the World Nuclear Association estimates.

- Electricity Generation by Nuclear Reactors
--------------------------------------------
In the section about Electricity Generation by Nuclear Reactors, it is mentioned that there are 440 operable nuclear reactors worldwide in 2023, with 65 under construction and 86 planned. The total electricity generation from nuclear reactors in 2023 was 398,553 TWh. Over the past 20 years, 106 reactors were retired, while 102 new ones started operation, resulting in a net capacity increase of about 21 GW. The Reference Scenario in the 2023 edition of The Nuclear Fuel Report predicts 66 reactors to close by 2040, with 308 new ones coming online. Additionally, it is noted that new plants coming online are balanced by old plants being retired.

- Membership and Contact Information for World Nuclear Association
------------------------------------------------------------------
The section provides membership and contact information for the World Nuclear Association, including details on how to join, contact information for general inquiries, membership inquiries, and media inquiries. The Association's address, phone numbers, and email addresses are also provided. The content also includes information on nuclear generation by country and uranium production figures. Additionally, the section includes data on world nuclear power reactors and uranium requirements, highlighting the number of reactors, electricity generation, construction status, and uranium requirements for various countries. The data is updated periodically, with information available from January 2007 to December 2007.

- Retirement and New Operation of Nuclear Reactors
--------------------------------------------------
New nuclear reactors are categorized as operable, under construction, planned, or proposed. Taiwan generated 17.2 TWh from nuclear power in 2023. Over the past 20 years, 106 reactors were retired while 102 new ones started operation, resulting in a net increase in capacity. The Reference Scenario for 2040 predicts the closure of 66 reactors and the opening of 308 new ones, including 31 in Japan. The average capacity of new reactors connected to the grid is larger than that of those retired, leading to a total capacity increase of about 21 GW. The World Nuclear Association updates this information regularly.
