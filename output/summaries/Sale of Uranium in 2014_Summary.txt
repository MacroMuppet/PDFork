General Summary
==================================================
The main goal of the document is to provide a secretarial determination regarding the sale or transfer of uranium in accordance with the United States Enrichment Corporation Privatization Act of 1996. The document outlines the Department's analysis of the potential impacts of transferring a total of 2,705 MTU natural uranium equivalent per calendar year for cleanup services and down-blending purposes. The Secretary has determined that these sales or transfers will not have an adverse material impact on the domestic uranium mining, conversion, or enrichment industries. The document also takes into account previous sales of uranium under the Russian Highly Enriched Uranium Agreement and the Suspension Agreement.

Main Conclusions and Findings
==================================================
- The Department has determined that the sales or transfers of a total of 2,705 MTU natural uranium equivalent per calendar year will not have an adverse material impact on the domestic uranium mining, conversion, or enrichment industries.
- The sales or transfers include natural uranium and natural uranium from off-specification non-uranium hexaflouride for cleanup services at specific plants, as well as low-enriched uranium for NNSA programs.
- The Department will ensure that the total amount transferred does not exceed 2,705 MTU natural uranium equivalent in any given year.
- Consideration was given to the Russian Highly Enriched Uranium Agreement and the Suspension Agreement in making this determination.
- The sales or transfers are structured to support cleanup services and NNSA programs without negatively affecting domestic industries.
- The Secretary of Energy, Ernest J. Moniz, has signed off on this determination.

Detailed Section Summaries
==================================================

1) Transfer of natural uranium and off-specification non-uranium hexaflouride for cleanup services at Paducah or Portsmouth Gaseous Diffusions Plants
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The Secretary of Energy has determined that the sales or transfers of natural uranium and low-enriched uranium for cleanup services at the Paducah or Portsmouth Gaseous Diffusions Plants will not have an adverse material impact on the domestic uranium mining, conversion, or enrichment industries. The transfers are limited to a total of 2,705 MTU natural uranium equivalent per calendar year, with specific quantities allocated for different purposes. The Secretary has also considered the sales of uranium under the Russian Highly Enriched Uranium Agreement and the Suspension Agreement in making this determination. The transfers are expected to occur in quarterly increments over the period of 2014 to 2022.

2) Transfer of low-enriched uranium (LEU) for down-blending highly-enriched uranium for NNSA programs
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The Department of Energy has determined that the sales or transfers of up to 2,705 MTU natural uranium equivalent per calendar year, including up to 2,055 MTU for cleanup services at Gaseous Diffusions Plants and up to 650 MTU for down-blending highly-enriched uranium for NNSA programs, will not have an adverse material impact on the domestic uranium industries. The transfers are scheduled to occur quarterly and in the event the NNSA transfers do not reach 650 MTU in any year, EM may transfer in excess of 600 MTU in the fourth quarter as long as the total amount transferred by the Department does not exceed the annual limit. The Department has taken into account the sales of uranium under existing agreements with Russia.

3) Potential excess transfer of natural uranium in the event NNSA transfers do not reach 650 MTU in any year
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The Department of Energy may transfer in excess of 600 MTU of natural uranium in the fourth quarter of a calendar year if NNSA transfers do not reach 650 MTU. The total amount transferred by the Department should not exceed 2,705 MTU natural uranium equivalent in a year. The Secretary of Energy determined that these transfers will not have an adverse material impact on domestic uranium industries, considering the current status and analysis of the uranium mining, conversion, and enrichment industries. The transfers include natural uranium for cleanup services at certain plants and low-enriched uranium for NNSA programs. The Secretary also considered sales under agreements with Russia in making this determination.

4) Determination that Departmental sales or transfers will not have an adverse impact on domestic uranium industries
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The Secretary has determined that the sales or transfers of a total of 2,705 MTU natural uranium equivalent per calendar year will not have an adverse impact on the domestic uranium industries. The transfers include natural uranium for cleanup services at specific plants and low-enriched uranium for down-blending programs. The Secretary considered the current status of the domestic uranium industries and took into account previous agreements related to uranium sales. The determination ensures that the Department's actions will not negatively affect domestic uranium mining, conversion, or enrichment industries.

5) Consideration of Russian Highly Enriched Uranium Agreement and Suspension Agreement in decision-making.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The Department has determined that sales or transfers of up to 2,705 MTU natural uranium equivalent per year will not adversely impact domestic uranium industries. This includes transferring natural uranium and uranium from off-specification hexaflouride for cleanup services at specific plants, as well as transferring low-enriched uranium for down-blending highly-enriched uranium for NNSA programs. The Department also considered the Russian Highly Enriched Uranium Agreement and Suspension Agreement in making this decision. The Secretary of Energy, Ernest J. Moniz, signed off on this determination.
