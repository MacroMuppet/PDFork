General Summary
==================================================
The main goals of the document are to address concerns regarding the diversion of uranium intended for commercial nuclear power for use in weapons, highlight the role of military uranium as a fuel source for commercial nuclear power, discuss the impact of agreements on the supply and demand of uranium, and explore options for using weapons-grade plutonium for electricity production. The purpose is to provide information on the relationship between military uranium and commercial nuclear power, as well as the implications of disarmament on the nuclear fuel cycle.

Main Conclusions and Findings
==================================================
- The new agreement did not significantly impact the supply and demand situation for uranium but did remove uncertainties around how the material would be released to the market.
- The 1993 agreement had a negative effect on uranium exploration activities and prices, which took around 10 years to recover.
- Disarmament efforts will result in 150-200 tonnes of weapons-grade plutonium, which can be used for electricity production.
- Options for weapons-grade plutonium include using it in fuel for electricity production, among others.

Detailed Section Summaries
==================================================

Concerns about uranium diversion
--------------------------------
The section discusses concerns about uranium diversion for military use instead of commercial nuclear power. The focus shifted to military uranium as a major fuel source for commercial nuclear power. The 1993 agreement impacted uranium exploration activities and prices until around 2003. The disarmament process will produce weapons-grade plutonium that can be used for electricity production, but strict security measures are necessary to prevent misuse. The USA dropped plans to immobilize most military plutonium in favor of using MOX fuel to degrade it. The April 2010 agreement with Russia reflects this shift in approach.

Military uranium as a source of fuel
------------------------------------
The key points from the section on 'Military uranium as a source of fuel' are that there has been concern about uranium intended for commercial nuclear power being diverted for weapons, leading to a focus on using military uranium as a major source of fuel for commercial nuclear power. Measures such as keeping weapons-grade plutonium under tight security and using MOX fuel to degrade it have been implemented to prevent extraction of Pu-239. The USA dropped its plans for immobilization of military plutonium in favor of these technical measures, as reflected in the 2010 agreement with Russia.

Role of military uranium
------------------------
The key points from the section on the role of military uranium include the concern over the diversion of uranium from commercial nuclear power to weapons, the focus on military uranium as a major source of fuel for commercial nuclear power, and the need for tight security measures to prevent weapons-grade plutonium from entering the civil fuel cycle. The USA has dropped its plans for immobilizing military plutonium in favor of using MOX fuel to degrade it and prevent the extraction of Pu-239. An agreement with Russia in April 2010 reflects this shift in approach.

Commercial nuclear power
------------------------
For over five decades, there has been concern about the diversion of uranium from commercial nuclear power for weapons use. However, there has been a shift in focus towards using military uranium as a significant source of fuel for commercial nuclear power. To ensure the security of weapons-grade plutonium entering the civil fuel cycle, tight security measures and technical solutions are necessary. The use of MOX fuel can help degrade plutonium so that it cannot be extracted. The USA has shifted away from plans to immobilize military plutonium, as seen in the 2010 agreement with Russia.

Privacy and terms
-----------------
The section discusses the concern over the diversion of uranium intended for commercial nuclear power for use in weapons, leading to a focus on military uranium as a fuel source for commercial nuclear power. The 1993 agreement on military uranium supply did not change the overall supply and demand situation but removed uncertainties on market release. Disarmament will produce weapons-grade plutonium, which can be used for electricity production but requires tight security measures. The USA's projects on using plutonium in MOX fuel reflect the efforts to prevent extraction of fissile isotopes. The agreement with Russia in April 2010 shows a shift away from immobilization plans for military plutonium.
