Uranium (nuclear) basics
------------------------
Uranium is the most widely used fuel for nuclear power plants, with the U.S. importing most of its uranium. The fuel used, U-235, is relatively rare compared to overall uranium, with economically recoverable reserves found in various countries worldwide. Nuclear power plants use nuclear fission to generate electricity, with uranium atoms splitting apart to release energy. The heat produced during fission is used to boil water, creating steam that spins turbines to generate electricity. The process involves a controlled nuclear chain reaction, where neutrons released from splitting uranium atoms continue to collide with other atoms. Cooling towers are not always necessary, as some plants use water from lakes, rivers, or the ocean for cooling. Nuclear reactors have containment structures to prevent accidental radiation releases.

Getting (producing) uranium
---------------------------
The United States imports most of the uranium it uses as fuel for nuclear power plants. Economically recoverable uranium reserves are found in various regions around the world, including the western United States, Australia, Canada, Central Asia, Africa, and South America. Once mined, uranium ore must be processed to extract the U-235 isotope needed for fuel. Nuclear power plants heat water to produce steam through nuclear fission, where atoms are split apart, releasing energy. The heat from fission boils water into steam, which drives turbines to generate electricity. Uranium is considered a nonrenewable energy source, with U-235 being relatively rare. Cooling systems vary in nuclear power plants, with some using water from lakes, rivers, or the ocean for cooling.

Types of nuclear reactors
-------------------------
Nuclear reactors in the U.S. use pressurized-water or boiling-water reactors to generate electricity. Pressurized-water reactors keep water under pressure to prevent it from turning to steam, while boiling-water reactors heat water directly into steam. Small modular reactors are being supported by the U.S. Department of Energy for commercialization. Nuclear reactors use uranium fuel pellets to produce energy through fission, which generates heat to boil water into steam for electricity production. Safety measures, such as containment structures and security teams, are in place to prevent uncontrolled nuclear reactions. Unlike fossil fuel-fired plants, nuclear reactors do not produce air pollution or carbon dioxide emissions.

Nuclear electricity generation
------------------------------
Nuclear power plants use nuclear fission to heat water and produce steam, which powers turbines to generate electricity. In the United States, 93 nuclear reactors operate at 54 power plants in 28 states, with 19 plants having one reactor, 31 having two reactors, and 4 having three reactors. The United States generates more nuclear power than any other country, with nuclear energy supplying about 20% of the nation's electricity. Nuclear reactors in the US use either boiling-water reactors or pressurized-water reactors to generate electricity. Cooling towers or water from ponds, rivers, or the ocean are used to cool the steam back into water for reuse in the process.

Nuclear waste management
------------------------
Nuclear waste management involves handling, transporting, storing, and disposing of radioactive materials such as tailings, spent reactor fuel, and other radioactive wastes. The U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission regulates the operation of nuclear power plants and the handling of radioactive wastes. Radioactive wastes are classified as low-level or high-level waste based on their radioactivity levels. Low-level waste includes tools, protective clothing, and wiping cloths, while high-level waste consists of spent nuclear reactor fuel. Spent reactor fuel assemblies are stored in pools of water or specially designed dry storage containers. The radioactivity of nuclear waste decreases over time through radioactive decay. The U.S. currently lacks a permanent disposal facility for high-level nuclear waste. Decommissioning of nuclear reactors involves safely removing radioactive equipment and reducing radioactivity levels for environmental protection.
