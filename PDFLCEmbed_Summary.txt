PDFLCEmbed.py - Functionality Summary

This Python script provides a comprehensive PDF processing and analysis pipeline with the following key features:

1. Text Extraction and Processing
   - Extracts text content from PDF files using PyPDF2
   - Splits text into manageable chunks for processing
   - Handles text encoding and empty content cases

2. Vector Store Management
   - Creates vector embeddings using OpenAI's embedding model
   - Stores embeddings using Chroma vector database
   - Provides functions to save and load vector stores

3. Conversational Chain
   - Implements a conversational retrieval chain using LangChain
   - Uses ChatOpenAI for generating responses
   - Maintains chat history for context-aware responses

4. Visual Element Extraction
   - Extracts images, charts, and tables from PDFs using PyMuPDF
   - Performs basic classification of visual elements using OpenCV
   - Detects chart-like and table-like features in images

5. Document Summarization
   - Generates section-wise summaries using LLM
   - Saves summaries in organized directory structure
   - Maintains metadata about processed content

6. File Management
   - Creates organized directory structure for outputs
   - Saves raw text, vector stores, and visual elements
   - Maintains JSON metadata for processed content

7. Query Interface
   - Provides functions to query processed documents
   - Supports conversation history
   - Returns context-aware responses

The script is designed to be used both as a module and as a standalone program, with example usage provided in the __main__ section. It includes comprehensive error handling and logging to ensure robust operation.
