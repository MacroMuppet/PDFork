Next Steps to Build a Niche Q&A Dataset:

Extract Key Topics & Main Points

Use an LLM (like GPT-4-turbo) to summarize key sections.
Identify core arguments, conclusions, and critical takeaways.
Generate Questions from Extracted Text

Use an LLM to generate questions based on each section.
Structure the questions based on Bloom’s Taxonomy (factual, conceptual, analytical).
Retrieve Relevant Visual Elements

Link extracted figures/tables to specific content.
Generate questions based on the visuals (e.g., "What does the chart on page 3 indicate?").
Store Q&A in a Structured Format

JSON or CSV format for training data.
Implementation:
Modify your existing pipeline to:

Summarize Key Points using your vector database retrieval.
Generate Q&A Pairs with OpenAI’s LLM or a fine-tuned model.
Link Visuals to Text to create multi-modal Q&A pairs.
