General Summary
==================================================
The main goal of the document is to secure a reliable supply of commercial nuclear fuel critical to U.S. clean energy and energy security goals by expanding domestic low enriched uranium (LEU) enrichment capabilities. This expansion aims to promote diversity in the LEU market and reduce reliance on Russian nuclear fuel. Nuclear energy is highlighted as a crucial component in transitioning to clean energy, providing economic opportunities, creating jobs, and improving the reliability and resilience of the power system. The United States has committed to tripling globally installed nuclear energy capacity by 2050, which will require deploying new reactors of all sizes and maintaining existing ones.

Main Conclusions and Findings
==================================================
- The U.S. Department of Energy is working to expand domestic commercial low enriched uranium (LEU) enrichment capabilities to support the fuel supply for nuclear reactors.
- The expansion of domestic LEU enrichment capabilities will promote diversity in the LEU market and provide a reliable supply of commercial nuclear fuel critical to U.S. clean energy and energy security goals.
- The Biden-Harris Administration is taking crucial steps to secure a nuclear fuel supply chain, including announcing $2.7 billion to boost the domestic nuclear fuel supply chain.
- The Russian uranium ban will accelerate the development of the U.S. nuclear fuel supply chain.
- A Request for Proposals (RFP) has been issued to spur additional domestic LEU enrichment capacity to reduce reliance on Russian nuclear fuel and ensure LEU demand is met through trusted sources.
- Any waiver under the RFP provision will terminate by January 1, 2028.

Detailed Section Summaries
==================================================

- Crucial Steps the Biden-Harris Administration is Taking to Secure a Nuclear Fuel Supply Chain
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The Biden-Harris Administration is taking crucial steps to secure the U.S. nuclear fuel supply chain, including banning Russian uranium imports and ensuring a stable source of uranium for nuclear reactors. With Russia currently supplying a significant portion of U.S. nuclear fuel imports, the administration's actions aim to prevent disruptions in nuclear power plants. The Department of Energy has released a process allowing waivers for specific quantities of Russian low enriched uranium under certain circumstances, with waivers set to expire by January 1, 2028. The administration's efforts are critical for the reliability and security of U.S. clean energy and energy goals.

- Expansion of domestic commercial low enriched uranium (LEU) enrichment capabilities
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The U.S. Department of Energy has selected six companies to compete for future work to supply low enriched uranium (LEU), promoting strong investment in the commercial sector. Developing domestic LEU capacity ensures a stable fuel supply for U.S. reactors and future deployments of advanced nuclear reactors. Contracts will last up to 10 years, with a minimum of $2 million per awardee. This expansion is necessary to meet the demand for LEU from trusted sources and reduce reliance on Russian nuclear fuel, especially in light of a ban on Russian LEU imports starting in 2024. The DOE is encouraging additional domestic LEU enrichment capacity to ensure a consistent supply of nuclear fuel for U.S. power plants.

- Importance of nuclear energy in clean energy transition
---------------------------------------------------------
Nuclear energy is crucial for the transition to clean energy, providing almost 20% of the nation's electricity and being the largest source of clean energy. The United States aims to triple globally installed nuclear energy capacity by 2050, requiring the deployment of new reactors of all sizes. To secure a stable supply of nuclear fuel, the Biden administration has taken steps to boost the domestic nuclear fuel supply chain and reduce reliance on Russian imports. This includes banning Russian LEU imports and providing a waiver process to ensure U.S. nuclear power plants do not experience disruptions. Maintaining and expanding nuclear energy capacity is essential for meeting clean energy and energy security goals.

- Pledge to triple globally installed nuclear energy capacity by 2050
---------------------------------------------------------------------
The United States, along with 25 other countries, has pledged to triple globally installed nuclear energy capacity by 2050. This expansion will require deploying new reactors of all sizes, including large, small modular, and microreactors, as well as keeping existing reactors online and adding more capacity through power uprates. To meet this pledge, a stable source of uranium is needed for fueling the reactors. Currently, Russia has a significant share of the world's uranium enrichment capacity, but President Biden signed a law banning Russian low-enriched uranium imports by 2024. The Department of Energy has released a process for granting waivers for importing Russian uranium under certain circumstances to ensure the stability of the U.S. nuclear fuel supply chain.

- Deployment of new reactors and keeping existing reactors online
-----------------------------------------------------------------
Nuclear energy is crucial for the nation's transition to clean energy, providing economic opportunities and reliable power. The US aims to triple its nuclear energy capacity by 2050, requiring the deployment of new reactors and keeping existing ones online. The US relies on Russian uranium imports, but a ban on Russian LEU imports will take effect in 2024. To ensure a stable fuel supply, the DOE has a process for granting waivers for Russian LEU imports until 2028. This aims to secure the US nuclear fuel supply chain and support clean energy and energy security goals.
