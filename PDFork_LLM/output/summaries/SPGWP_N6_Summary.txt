General Summary
==================================================
The document explores the role of public opinion and party politics in shaping the French pro-nuclear energy policy. It analyzes historical party manifestos from the Gaullist, Communist, and UDF parties, highlighting the low salience of nuclear energy in political agendas. Despite citizens' preferences, parties have historically converged towards pro-nuclear stances, suggesting a disconnect between public opinion and policy decisions. The study emphasizes the importance of understanding party representatives' motivations beyond electoral considerations. The research is supported by the CMP archive at GESIS and acknowledges various contributors for their support and feedback. The document aims to contribute to the understanding of how policy decisions are influenced by public opinion and party dynamics in liberal democracies.

Main Conclusions and Findings
==================================================
Main conclusions, findings, and key takeaways:

1. Responsiveness to public opinion is commonly considered essential in liberal democracies, but studies suggest that it may be growingly irrelevant in contemporary democracies.
2. Existing public policy literature often neglects or underestimates the role of public opinion in policymaking, focusing instead on factors like path dependence, institutional friction, and interest groups.
3. The study of French nuclear energy policy highlights the importance of issue politicization in party competition and its impact on translating public opinion into policy.
4. Nuclear energy is found to be less salient in party manifestos compared to other issues, leading to a convergence of main French parties towards pro-nuclear stances despite potential citizen preferences.
5. The misfit between citizens' preferences and policy decisions can be attributed to party representatives' motivations beyond attracting votes, including policy-related considerations.
6. To address questions of policymaking beyond public opinion, understanding the determinants of variations in responsiveness is crucial, with issue salience, institutions, and party politics being key factors to consider.

Detailed Section Summaries
==================================================

- Indexing of articles on nuclear energy in Le Monde
----------------------------------------------------
The analysis of articles on nuclear energy in Le Monde from 1977-2012 shows variations in visibility, with high attention in the late 1970s due to anti-nuclear protests and incidents like Three Mile Island. The annual Index Le Monde was used until 2001, with additional data from Factiva for 1995-2008. The source effect between electronic and indexed content was found to be weak. The media agenda-setting role of Le Monde was highlighted, with consistent coverage of nuclear energy issues. Attention to nuclear energy increased in the mid-2000s, driven by debates on nuclear dissemination, global warming, and the French nuclear industry. Incidents at French nuclear facilities in 2008 also contributed to high media attention.

- Attention to nuclear energy in French party manifestos
--------------------------------------------------------
The section discusses the low salience of nuclear energy in French party manifestos, despite historical support for nuclear energy expansion by the Gaullist party. The depoliticization of nuclear energy has led to a consensus among parties on a pro-nuclear stance, with little attention given to the issue in electoral campaigns. The lack of alignment with citizens' preferences and the focus on policy and office-related considerations by party representatives have contributed to this trend. The section also highlights the critical juncture of nuclear expansion and political alternation in the 1970s, where the Socialist Party prioritized accommodating the pro-nuclear stance of the Communist Party over responding to anti-nuclear voters.

- Public mood towards nuclear energy survey questions
-----------------------------------------------------
The section discusses the public mood towards nuclear energy in France based on survey questions. The data collected from 302 estimates of the 'nuclear support index' from 24 different question wordings shows that there has been no majority support for nuclear energy among French citizens for most of the period considered. Support peaked in the early 1980s but declined after the Chernobyl accident in 1986. Support increased in the 1990s and reached a peak in 2000, but remained below 48%. The 2000s saw a new low in public mood towards nuclear energy, with values between 44% and 48%. Surprisingly, there was a sharp rise in support in 2012, following the Fukushima accident. The 'public mood' indicator allows for an estimation of public opinion towards nuclear energy and its evolution over almost four decades.

- Factors influencing democratic responsiveness to public opinion
-----------------------------------------------------------------
The section discusses the importance of democratic responsiveness to public opinion in liberal democracies, highlighting the link between public opinion and policy decisions. It emphasizes the need to consider factors such as issue salience, institutions, and party politics in understanding policymakers' responsiveness to public opinion. The article focuses on the role of issue politicization in party competition and how it influences the translation of public opinion into public policy. It challenges the conventional wisdom of the growing irrelevance of responsiveness in contemporary democracies and suggests that public opinion should not be disregarded in public policy analyses. The study on French choices in nuclear energy policy illustrates the complexities involved in the relationship between public opinion and policy decisions.

- Acknowledgments and funding sources
-------------------------------------
The section highlights the neglect of politics in public policy literature, with a focus on factors like path dependence, interest groups, and institutional friction. Constraints like the internationalization of the economy and limited resources limit policymakers' ability to respond to public demands. The authors question if policies are being made beyond public opinion and discuss the role of party politics in mediating between public preferences and policy choices. They emphasize the need to integrate party strategies into analyses of responsiveness and policymaking. The authors acknowledge funding sources and thank contributors for their support and input on the study of nuclear energy policy in France.
