General Summary
==================================================
The main goal of the document is to address the scandal involving Southern California Edison (SCE) and the fines imposed by the California Public Utilities Commission (PUC) for fraudulent conduct related to customer satisfaction surveys and safety reporting. SCE must pay a $30 million fine into the state's general fund within 30 days and submit a plan within the same timeframe regarding $81 million in refunds to customers. Additionally, the PUC approved an energy-efficiency strategic plan for 2009-2020, aiming for zero net energy in new residential and commercial constructions, energy efficiency in low-income homes, and improvements in heating, ventilation, and air-conditioning systems. Consumer advocate Mark Toney praised the decision, highlighting it as a victory for consumers and indicating the severity of SCE's violations.

Main Conclusions and Findings

Detailed Section Summaries
==================================================

- Groundbreaking energy-efficiency strategic plan
-------------------------------------------------
The California Public Utilities Commission approved a groundbreaking energy-efficiency strategic plan for 2009 through 2020. The plan aims to achieve goals such as making all new residential construction zero net energy by 2020 and all new commercial construction zero net energy by 2030. Additionally, the plan includes making all eligible low-income homes energy efficient by 2020 and improving efficiency in heating, ventilation, and air-conditioning systems. The decision was applauded by consumer advocate Mark Toney, who called it a victory for consumers. This decision comes after Edison was fined $30 million for misconduct related to manipulating customer-satisfaction surveys and falsifying injury data. The company must also submit a plan within 30 days regarding $81 million in refunds for customers.

- Violations and fines imposed on Edison
----------------------------------------
Edison was fined $30 million for fraud after manipulating customer satisfaction survey results from 1997 to 2003. Employees were encouraged to change or erase phone numbers of unhappy customers to prevent negative feedback. The company must also refund $81 million to customers. Despite Edison's cooperation and voluntary reporting of the issue, the fine would have been higher without their assistance. The fraud case revealed falsified injury data and safety violations at the San Onofre Nuclear Generating Station. The California Public Utilities Commission imposed the fine, with consumer advocates praising the decision as a victory for consumers. The severity of the violations justified the significant fine imposed on Edison. The company has 30 days to pay the fine and submit a plan for the refunds.

- Refunds for customers or future rates
---------------------------------------
The state Public Utilities Commission fined Southern California Edison $30 million and ordered the utility to refund over $81 million to customers due to a seven-year fraud that caused harm to consumers. The company must pay the fine into the general fund within 30 days and submit a plan within the same timeframe on whether the refunds will be given as bill credits or taken out of future rates. Additionally, the PUC approved an energy-efficiency strategic plan for 2009-2020, aiming for zero net energy in new residential construction by 2020 and new commercial construction by 2030, as well as making low-income homes energy efficient and improving efficiency in heating, ventilation, and air-conditioning systems. The fraud involved rigging customer satisfaction surveys to win bonuses and incentives, with penalties reduced due to Edison's cooperation in the case.

- Rigged customer satisfaction surveys
--------------------------------------
Edison manipulated customer satisfaction surveys to win rewards from 1997 through 2003 by rigging survey results, erasing or changing phone numbers of unhappy customers, and submitting falsified data for bonuses. The company must pay a $30 million fine and refund $81 million in overcharges. The scandal also involved falsifying injury data, with managers pressuring employees to treat themselves and doctors to alter records. Consumer advocate Mark Toney praised the decision as a victory for consumers, while the California Public Utilities Commission acknowledged Edison's cooperation in the case. The severity of the violations led to the imposition of a significant fine, with potential penalties reaching $102 million if not for Edison's assistance in the investigation. The scandal was exposed in 2004, eventually resulting in the fine and refunds.

- Consumer advocate response to decision
----------------------------------------
Consumer advocate Mark Toney praised the California Public Utilities Commission's decision to fine Southern California Edison $30 million and order them to refund over $81 million to customers for fraudulent practices. The commission found that the utility had engaged in a seven-year fraud that harmed consumers and potentially compromised worker safety. Toney commended the decision as a victory for consumers, highlighting the severity of the fine imposed by a typically utility-friendly commission. The fraud involved manipulating customer satisfaction surveys, falsifying injury data, and rigging results to win bonuses. Additionally, the PUC approved an energy-efficiency strategic plan for 2009-2020, setting ambitious goals for zero net energy construction and energy efficiency improvements. Edison must pay the fine within 30 days and submit a plan for refund distribution and future rates adjustments.
