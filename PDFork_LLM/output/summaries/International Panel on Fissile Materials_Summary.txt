General Summary
==================================================
The document aims to provide an overview of the United States' stockpile of fissile materials, including highly enriched uranium (HEU) and plutonium, and their potential uses for military or civilian purposes. The main goals include fostering initiatives to reduce stocks and end the production and use of highly enriched uranium and plutonium, as well as providing information on the current status of the United States' nuclear weapon stockpile and fissile material inventory. The document also highlights the United States' commitment to safeguarding separated plutonium and reducing the amount of material available for weapons purposes through down-blending or disposal.

Main Conclusions and Findings
==================================================
- The United States has an estimated nuclear weapon stockpile of 5,044 warheads, with approximately 3,700 in active stockpile and 1,300 awaiting dismantlement.
- The current stock of fissile materials in the United States includes 87.6 tonnes of plutonium and 483 tonnes of unirradiated highly enriched uranium.
- The majority of the separated unirradiated plutonium in the U.S. is considered military stock, with only 3 tonnes safeguarded under IAEA safeguards.
- The U.S. has not produced fissile materials for weapons since 1964, with all production reactors shut down by 1987.
- The U.S. HEU stockpile is estimated to be around 483 tons as of 2023, with a reduction from 585.6 tons declared in 2013.
- The U.S. pledged not to use separated plutonium for military purposes, with most of it stored in weapons or components.
- The amount of material available for potential down-blend to low enriched uranium or disposal has been reduced to 18 tonnes by the end of 2022.

Detailed Section Summaries
==================================================

International Panel on Fissile Materials
----------------------------------------
The United States has a significant stockpile of nuclear weapons, with an estimated 5,044 warheads in January 2022. The country also possesses 87.6 tonnes of plutonium and 483 tonnes of unirradiated highly-enriched uranium. The United States has pledged not to use most of this material for military purposes, with only 3 tonnes of separated plutonium being safeguarded under IAEA safeguards. The production of highly-enriched uranium for weapons ended in 1964, but the country still has a significant stockpile of HEU, with 465.1 tonnes available for use as of the end of 2022. The United States is committed to reducing stocks of fissile materials and ending their production and use.

Nuclear Weapon Stockpile in the United States
---------------------------------------------
The United States has an estimated nuclear weapon stockpile of 5,044 warheads, with about 3,700 in active stockpile and 1,300 awaiting dismantlement. The country has 87.6 tonnes of unirradiated plutonium and 483 tonnes of highly enriched uranium. Production of HEU for weapons ended in 1964, but the US has a HEU stockpile estimated at 483 tons. Most of the separated plutonium (79.7 tons) is considered military stock, with only 3 tons safeguarded by the IAEA. The US has reduced its available HEU stockpile from 499.4 tons in 2013 to 465.1 tons by the end of 2022. The country's separated plutonium inventory was 95.4 tons in 2009, with 87.6 tons considered military stock.

Fissile Materials Stock in the United States
--------------------------------------------
The United States has a stockpile of 5,044 nuclear warheads, with 87.6 tonnes of plutonium and 483 tonnes of highly-enriched uranium. The production of fissile materials for weapons ended in 1964, with all production reactors shut down in 1987. The United States has a HEU stockpile of approximately 483 tons. Of the 87.6 tons of unirradiated plutonium, 79.7 tons are considered military stock, with only 3 tons safeguarded under IAEA safeguards. The United States has declared 499.4 tons of fissile materials for various programs, including nuclear weapons, naval propulsion, and nuclear energy. The amount available for potential down-blend or disposal has been reduced to about 465.1 tonnes by the end of 2022.

Highly Enriched Uranium Stockpile
---------------------------------
The United States has a significant stockpile of highly enriched uranium, with an estimated 483 tons as of 2023. The country has ceased production of HEU for weapons since 1964, but has continued to produce HEU for naval-reactor fuel until 1992. The stockpile also includes 87.6 tons of plutonium, with most of it considered military stock. The United States has committed to not using this material for military purposes, with only 3 tons of separated plutonium being safeguarded under IAEA oversight. The total inventory of fissile materials in the United States is estimated at 87.6 tons of plutonium and 483 tons of unirradiated highly enriched uranium.

Separated Plutonium Inventory
-----------------------------
The United States has a total of 87.6 tons of unirradiated plutonium, with 79.7 tons considered military stock. Only 3 tons of separated plutonium are safeguarded under IAEA safeguards at the Savannah River Site. The United States disposed of 0.4 tons of plutonium in WIPP and lost 0.2 tons to radioactive decay since 2009. Additionally, the US has an estimated 483 tons of unirradiated highly-enriched uranium, with 89.5 tons in naval reserve and 14.6 tons reserved for research reactors. The US is not currently producing fissile materials for weapons, with production of HEU for weapons ending in 1964. The US has a HEU stockpile estimated to be about 483 tons as of the beginning of 2023.
