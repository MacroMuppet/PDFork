General Summary
==================================================
The document discusses the impact of government subsidies on fossil fuel and renewable energy industries, highlighting the need to shift towards clean energy sources to combat climate change. It outlines the various forms of subsidies, such as tax credits and research investments, that support renewable energy and level the playing field with fossil fuels. The main goals are to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, promote clean energy adoption, and address the climate crisis through international cooperation and policy initiatives.

Main Conclusions and Findings
==================================================
- Heating buildings contributes more to climate pollution than air conditioning globally, and this trend holds true at the level of individual buildings as well.
- Emissions from air conditioning are rising faster than those from heating.
- Governments worldwide spend hundreds of billions of dollars annually subsidizing fossil fuels, potentially over a trillion, leading to increased burning of fossil fuels and greenhouse gas emissions.
- Human activities emit roughly 400 million metric tons of methane annually, accounting for up to two-thirds of methane entering the atmosphere.
- The cooling effect from sulfate aerosols produced by burning coal and oil has had a substantial impact, but global warming caused by human activities has outweighed this effect, resulting in a warming of almost 1.5°C.
- Investors are increasingly considering climate change risks in their investment decisions, leading to a shift towards renewable energy sources and divestment from fossil fuels.

Detailed Section Summaries
==================================================

- Carbon Pricing
----------------
Carbon pricing is a policy tool to lower emissions of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases by putting a tax or price on them. This helps investors factor in risks from climate change into their choices. Government subsidies for fossil fuels, which amount to hundreds of billions of dollars annually, lead to more burning of fossil fuels and climate pollution. Some countries use price caps or subsidies to control energy prices, while others may subsidize domestic energy production or store a minimum amount of fuel like coal. The ongoing Ukraine-Russia war has caused spikes in energy prices. Carbon pricing can help shift investments towards renewable energy sources like wind, solar, and hydropower.

- Investing and Climate Change
------------------------------
Investors are increasingly factoring risks from climate change into their investment choices, leading to divestment from fossil fuels. Carbon pricing, such as a tax or green bonds, is a policy tool to lower emissions of greenhouse gases. Renewables like wind, solar, and hydropower are highlighted as sources of energy that cannot run out. Offshore wind energy is noted as a relatively expensive option for clean energy, but there are practical reasons why some states have focused on it. The cooling effect from sulfur produced by burning coal and oil has hidden some global warming, but human activities have still warmed the planet by almost 1.5°C. Heating contributes more to climate change than cooling, and human activities emit roughly 400 million metric tons of methane into the atmosphere annually.

- Renewable Energy
------------------
Government subsidies have a significant impact on the prices of fossil fuel and renewable energy sources. Subsidies for fossil fuels can lead to inefficient behavior and higher consumption of polluting energy sources. On the other hand, subsidies for renewable energy aim to level the playing field and make clean energy more competitive. Solar panels and onshore wind farms are now competitive with fossil fuels in many places, but other technologies like geothermal and offshore wind still require more government support to compete. Ultimately, energy subsidies reflect a country's values and goals in promoting cleaner energy sources. The Biden Administration in the U.S. has implemented subsidies for renewable energy as part of its climate initiatives.

- Coastal states meeting clean energy needs
-------------------------------------------
Coastal states are looking at meeting their clean energy needs by considering options like offshore wind energy, which is relatively expensive compared to other renewable technologies. However, there are practical reasons some states have focused on offshore wind. Energy subsidies play a significant role in influencing consumer behavior, with fossil fuel subsidies providing the wrong price signal and promoting inefficient behavior. On the other hand, renewable energy subsidies aim to level the playing field and make non-climate-polluting energy more cost-competitive. Governments can support renewable energy through investments in research and development, tax credits, and setting requirements for a percentage of energy to come from renewable sources. The impact of subsidies on energy prices and consumption is significant and can contribute to climate change.

- Methane emissions from human activities
-----------------------------------------
Heating buildings contributes more to climate pollution than cooling buildings, with emissions from heating rising faster. Globally, humans emit roughly 400 million metric tons of methane annually, with heating creating more pollution than air conditioning. Methane emissions from human activities make up as much as two-thirds of all methane entering the atmosphere. Despite the cooling effect of sulfate aerosols produced from burning coal and oil, global warming due to human activities has still warmed the planet by almost 1.5°C. Governments worldwide spend hundreds of billions of dollars each year subsidizing fossil fuels, leading to increased burning of fossil fuels and more climate pollution.
