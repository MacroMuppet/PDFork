General Summary
==================================================
The main goal of the document is to address the management and disposal issues surrounding the U.S. stockpile of uranium-233. It highlights concerns such as safeguarding, security, safety risks, and the burden of disposal left by the production of the stockpile. The document emphasizes the need for adequate protection of weapons-grade material, addressing environmental, safety, and health risks, as well as finding solutions for the disposal of uranium-233. It raises awareness about the risks associated with the storage and management of this fissile material, urging for proper measures to be taken to ensure the safety and security of the stockpile.

Main Conclusions and Findings
==================================================
Main conclusions, findings, and key takeaways from the document:
1. The storage of the U.S. stockpile of uranium-233 poses safeguard, security, and safety risks, with concerns about inventory problems, inadequate protection of weapons-grade material, and environmental, safety, and health risks.
2. Production of the stockpile has left a disposal burden, including the management and disposal of spent thorium fuel from commercial reactors and the disposal of uranium-233, potentially even in landfills.
3. Lack of proper security measures at the storage facility poses significant risks, including potential offsite doses of radiation in case of natural events, fires, explosions, and container failures.
4. The United States has neglected proper safeguards for a significant amount of fissile material, raising concerns about the management and long-term disposal of this material.
5. Despite recommendations for improvement, the conditions of the storage facility have deteriorated, and management and costs have continued to escalate over time.

Detailed Section Summaries
==================================================

Meeting
-------
The section discusses meetings in Atlanta, GA in February 1978, Aiken, SC in June 1978, and Oak Ridge, TN in October 1985, focusing on nuclear reactors and uranium-233. It mentions the potential of plutonium-fueled fast-reactors to produce electricity and more fuel than they consume. The Nuclear Waste Policy Act defines high-level radioactive waste and the U.S. Department of Energy's Uranium-233 Disposition Project. Uranium-233 is compared to plutonium for weapons-usability, with details on its critical mass and enrichment levels. The section also includes references to historical events and documents related to nuclear testing and uranium-233 research.

Atlanta, GA, February 1978
--------------------------
The section discusses the use of thorium fuel in nuclear reactors, specifically in the Peach Bottom I Unit and the Fort St. Vrain plant. The Peach Bottom I Unit, a high-temperature gas-cooled reactor using thorium fuel, operated from 1967 to 1974 but was closed due to fuel element failures. Its spent fuel is stored at the DOE's Idaho National Engineering Laboratory. The Fort St. Vrain plant, operating from 1979 to 1989, was a high-temperature-gas-cooled reactor using thorium and uranium-235 fuels. Numerous equipment failures and human errors led to its closure, and DOE is responsible for its spent fuel stored in dry casks at the reactor site.

Savannah River Plant, El. du Pont de Nemours and Company, D.A. Orth, SRP Thorium Processing Experience, Aiken, SC, June 1978
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The key points and findings from the section about Savannah River Plant, El. du Pont de Nemours and Company, D.A. Orth, SRP Thorium Processing Experience in Aiken, SC in June 1978 include:

- Thorium processing experiences at various sites from 1954 to 1970 were summarized, including the production and recovery of uranium-233.
- The Peach Bottom I Unit, a high-temperature gas-cooled reactor using thorium fuel, experienced fuel element failures and was shut down in 1974.
- The Fort St. Vrain plant, a high-temperature-gas-cooled reactor using thorium and uranium-235 fuels, faced numerous operational challenges leading to its closure in 1989.
- Between 1954 and 1970, significant amounts of uranium-233 were produced and separated from thorium at various reprocessing plants, with associated costs estimated at $5.5 to $11 billion.

Oak Ridge National Laboratory, Chemical Technology Division Progress Report for the Period April 1983, 10 March 21, 1985, ORNL-6153, Oak Ridge, TN, October 1985
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The section discusses the progress report of Oak Ridge National Laboratory, Chemical Technology Division from April 1983 to March 1985. It highlights the development of plutonium-fueled fast reactors as a promising source of electricity and increased fuel production. The report also covers uranium-233 storage alternatives, thorium fuel reprocessing experiences, and disposal options for uranium-233. Additionally, it mentions the controls over special nuclear materials, environmental assessments for uranium-233 projects, and technical competencies for safe storage and management of uranium-233. The findings emphasize the importance of safe and efficient handling of nuclear materials in various facilities.

Managing the U.S. Uranium-233 Stockpile
---------------------------------------
The United States has a stockpile of uranium-233, a weapons-useable fissile material, with concerns about inventory problems and inadequate protection. Approximately 96 kg of uranium-233 may be unaccounted for, and there are issues with material control and accountability. The storage facility at Oak Ridge National Laboratory does not meet current safeguards and security requirements. The production of the stockpile has also left a disposal burden, including management and disposal of spent thorium fuel and uranium-233. The United States' decision to cut costs has resulted in risks related to safeguard, security, safety, and health. The stockpile poses environmental risks and there are challenges in disposing of the material, including potentially in landfills.
