General Summary
==================================================
The main goal of the document is to provide global scenarios for the demand and supply availability of nuclear fuel from 2023 to 2040. It highlights the increasing projections for future nuclear capacity and the demand for nuclear fuel cycle services. The report considers three scenarios: the Reference Scenario, Lower Scenario, and Upper Scenario, based on government and utility targets and objectives. It projects a significant increase in nuclear capacity by 2040 and emphasizes the role of nuclear power in achieving net-zero carbon emissions. The report also discusses the primary production of uranium and the diminishing role of secondary supplies in the world market. The document serves as a definitive reference source for the nuclear industry and can be ordered from the World Nuclear Association's website shop for Â£1200.

Main Conclusions and Findings
==================================================
Main conclusions and key takeaways from the document:

1. Global efforts to decarbonize energy supplies and political commitment to energy security have led to significant increases in projections for future nuclear capacity and demand for nuclear fuel cycle services.
2. Geopolitical instability, such as the Russia-Ukraine war, has increased interest in nuclear power for energy security and sovereignty.
3. Extending the operating lifetimes of existing nuclear reactors is a positive change, with many countries allowing plants to operate for up to 60 or 80 years.
4. There is a strong interest in small modular reactors, alongside gigawatt-scale reactors, from governments, utilities, and industrial end-users.
5. The report considers three scenarios for nuclear capacity growth, with the Reference Scenario projecting an increase to 686 GWe by 2040, the Upper Scenario to 931 GWe, and the Lower Scenario to 486 GWe.

Overall, the report highlights the growing importance of nuclear power in the global energy landscape, driven by decarbonization efforts, energy security concerns, and interest in new reactor technologies.

==================================================

Global Effort to Decarbonize Energy Supplies
--------------------------------------------
The global effort to decarbonize energy supplies has led to increased projections for future nuclear capacity and demand for nuclear fuel cycle services. The report considers three scenarios, with the Reference Scenario projecting nuclear capacity to reach 686 GWe by 2040, the Upper Scenario reaching 931 GWe, and the Lower Scenario reaching 486 GWe. Geopolitical instability has also increased interest in nuclear power for energy security, with countries extending the operating lifetimes of existing reactors. There is growing interest in small modular reactors and microreactors, with SMRs contributing up to 10% of total capacity in the Upper Scenario by 2040. The report can be ordered from the World Nuclear Association's website shop.

Primary Production of Uranium
-----------------------------
Primary production of uranium from mines, conversion plants, and enrichment plants remains the main source of supply for nuclear reactors globally. While secondary supplies will continue to bridge the gap between supply and demand in the near term, their role is projected to diminish gradually in the world market. Geopolitical instability, such as the Russia-Ukraine war, has increased interest in nuclear power for energy security. The report highlights extended operating lifetimes for existing nuclear reactors and growing interest in small modular reactors. Projections show significant increases in future nuclear capacity and demand for nuclear fuel cycle services, with scenarios ranging from 486 GWe to 931 GWe by 2040. The scenarios are based on government and utility targets, with nuclear power playing a crucial role in achieving net-zero carbon emissions goals.

Geopolitical Instability and Increased Interest in Nuclear Power
----------------------------------------------------------------
Geopolitical instability, particularly from the Russia-Ukraine conflict, has increased interest in nuclear power for energy security. This instability has affected the global market for nuclear fuel cycle services, leading North America and Europe to diversify supplies. Extending the operating lifetimes of existing nuclear reactors is a positive change, with countries allowing plants to operate for up to 60 or even 80 years. This, along with the interest in small modular reactors, has resulted in significant growth projections for future nuclear capacity. The report considers three scenarios, with the Reference Scenario projecting nuclear capacity to reach 686 GWe by 2040. Primary production of uranium remains the main source for reactor fuel, with secondary supplies expected to play a diminishing role in the market.

Extending Operating Lifetimes of Existing Nuclear Reactors
----------------------------------------------------------
The section discusses the increasing interest in nuclear power due to geopolitical instability, with countries extending the operating lifetimes of existing nuclear reactors. Up to 140 reactors could operate until 2040, driven by economic factors, emissions reduction goals, and security of energy supply. The report also highlights the growing demand for nuclear fuel cycle services and projections for future nuclear capacity, with governments, utilities, and industrial users showing interest in small modular reactors. Additionally, primary production of uranium remains the main source for nuclear reactors, with secondary supplies projected to play a diminishing role in the market by 2050.

Interest in Small Modular Reactors
----------------------------------
Governments, utilities, and industrial end-users are increasingly interested in small modular reactors (SMRs) and microreactors due to their simpler construction and financing. The report highlights that SMRs could contribute up to 10% of total large-scale capacity by 2040. Geopolitical instability, such as the Russia-Ukraine war, has also led to a greater interest in nuclear power for energy security and sovereignty. Extending the operating lifetimes of existing nuclear reactors is seen as a positive change, driven by economics, emissions reduction targets, and security of supply. The report projects significant growth in future nuclear capacity, with the Reference Scenario projecting a capacity of 686 GWe by 2040, while the Upper Scenario sees capacity reaching 931 GWe.
