General Summary
==================================================
The document from the U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA) outlines the sources of uranium for U.S. nuclear power plants from 1950 to 2022. It highlights the amount of uranium oxide produced domestically, purchased imports, and power plant purchases from domestic suppliers. The main goal of the document is to provide information on where the U.S. gets its uranium from, showing that the majority is imported. It also breaks down the percentage shares of total U.S. purchases of uranium in 2022 by country, with Canada, Kazakhstan, Russia, and Uzbekistan being the main suppliers. The document emphasizes the importance of uranium as a fuel for nuclear power plants and the global distribution of economically recoverable reserves.

Main Conclusions and Findings
==================================================
Main Conclusions and Key Takeaways:

1. The United States imports most of the uranium used as fuel for nuclear power plants, with economically recoverable reserves located in various countries including the western United States, Australia, Canada, Central Asia, Africa, and South America.

2. Uranium production in the United States peaked in 1980, and domestic purchases by U.S. nuclear power plant operators peaked in 1981. Since 1992, the majority of uranium purchased by U.S. nuclear power plant operators has been imported.

3. In 2022, owners and operators of U.S. civilian nuclear power reactors purchased 40.5 million pounds of uranium oxide from both U.S. and foreign suppliers.

4. The main sources and percentage shares of total U.S. purchases of uranium in 2022 were Canada (9%), Kazakhstan (16%), Russia (0%), Uzbekistan (0%), Australia (0%), and six other countries combined.

5. Data regarding U.S. power plant purchases from domestic suppliers in 2019 and domestic production in 2020 were withheld to avoid disclosure of individual company data, indicating a level of confidentiality in the industry.

- Basics of Uranium
-------------------
The United States imports most of the uranium it uses as fuel for nuclear power plants. Uranium is a common metal found in rocks all over the world and occurs in combination with small amounts of other elements. Economically recoverable uranium reserves are located in various countries including the western United States, Australia, Canada, Central Asia, Africa, and South America. Uranium production in the United States peaked in 1980, and since 1992, the majority of uranium purchased by U.S. nuclear power plant operators has been imported. In 2022, owners and operators of U.S. civilian nuclear power reactors purchased 40.5 million pounds of U3O8 from U.S. and foreign suppliers, with Canada, Kazakhstan, Russia, and Uzbekistan being the main sources.
