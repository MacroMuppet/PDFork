General Summary
==================================================
The document acknowledges the input of various individuals and organizations, including the Rocky Mountain Institute and the German Federal Ministry for Environment, Nature Conservation and Reactor Safety. It highlights the need for a comprehensive analysis of the nuclear energy industry, emphasizing the importance of factual information over speculation. The report covers various aspects of the nuclear energy sector, including operation, power generation, new build projects, and economic analysis. The goal of the document is to provide a detailed overview of the current status and trends in the nuclear industry to inform discussions and decision-making processes related to nuclear energy development.

Main Conclusions and Findings
==================================================
Main Conclusions and Findings:

1. The future of the nuclear energy industry is heavily influenced by media reports, expert meetings, and political debates, with much of the data being speculative rather than based on thorough analysis of the industry's history and current trends.
2. The economic analysis in the report is biased, with significant changes made to economic assumptions not being clearly mentioned in the summary or conclusions.
3. The report suggests that without further action, nuclear power may diminish as a viable option for addressing climate change risks.
4. The report highlights the need for more in-depth analysis and unbiased reporting on the nuclear energy industry to inform decisions and policy-making.
5. The report does not necessarily reflect the opinion of the German Federal Ministry for Environment, Nature Conservation and Reactor Safety, but represents the perspective of the contractor.

Key Takeaways:

1. Clear and unbiased analysis of the nuclear energy industry is crucial for informed decision-making.
2. Economic assumptions and biases in reports should be transparently communicated in summaries and conclusions.
3. Continued research and monitoring of the nuclear energy industry are necessary to assess its future viability and contribution to climate change mitigation efforts.

Detailed Section Summaries
==================================================

Executive Summary and Conclusions
---------------------------------
The section on 'Executive Summary and Conclusions' highlights the importance of analyzing the nuclear energy industry based on historical data and trends rather than speculation. The report acknowledges the input of experts and contributors but emphasizes that any errors are the responsibility of the authors. The report also mentions the differing economic analysis compared to previous reports, with a focus on the potential decline of nuclear power if more action is not taken. Key questions raised include the delivery and budgeting of new nuclear units and their ability to replace aging reactors. The report also includes a special focus on economic issues, especially in light of the international economic crisis and the high capital input required for nuclear technology.

Introduction
------------
The introduction discusses the future of the global nuclear industry, highlighting the gap between current industrial trends and the perception of a nuclear renaissance. It references the International Atomic Energy Agency's revised projections for nuclear power generation, noting a decline in nuclear's share of global electricity generation. The section raises questions about whether these trends are short-term or structural, and what the future projections for the nuclear industry may be. The authors emphasize the importance of analyzing nuclear energy's industrial history and current operating status to understand the industry's future trajectory.

Overview of Operation, Power Generation, Age Distribution
---------------------------------------------------------
The section provides an overview of the operation, power generation, and age distribution of nuclear reactors. It discusses the global trends in nuclear power generation, highlighting a decline in nuclear electricity generation in 2008 compared to previous years. The age distribution of currently operating reactors is analyzed, with only two reactors exceeding the 40-year mark and scheduled for closure. The potential for reactors to operate for up to sixty years is explored, with limited operational experience beyond 30 years. The section also questions the perception of a "nuclear renaissance" in the industry and discusses the projections for the future of nuclear power generation.

International Nuclear Expansion Schemes
---------------------------------------
The section on International Nuclear Expansion Schemes discusses the gap between media speculation and the actual trends in the global nuclear industry. The International Atomic Energy Agency reported a decline in nuclear power's share of global electricity generation, despite projections for growth. The report analyzes the construction of new nuclear units, economic issues, and the competitiveness of nuclear technology. The industrial landscape has changed since the peak of nuclear construction in 1980, with companies shifting away from nuclear energy. The report also highlights international developments, such as nuclear cooperation agreements between countries like the US and UAE, and Russia's involvement in providing nuclear assistance to Venezuela. The section raises questions about the future role of nuclear power in the global energy balance.

Overview of Current New-Build
-----------------------------
The section on 'Overview of Current New-Build' highlights the challenges facing the nuclear power industry, including delays in construction sites and the need for substantial increases in education, workforce development, and manufacturing capacity. It also discusses how nuclear power may not play a critical role in limiting CO2 concentrations until mid-century at the earliest. The report also mentions issues facing the Canadian nuclear industry, including local opposition to projects, a shortage of skilled workers, and the need for a new design of Candu, ACR-1000. Overall, the World Nuclear Industry Status Report 2009 provides a comprehensive overview of nuclear power plants worldwide, including their economic performance.
