It is the only element with a\nnaturally-occurring fissile isotope.\nDepleted uranium is a by-product from enriching\nnatural uranium to use in nuclear power reactors.\nMost of the uranium used in nuclear reactors can be\nrecycled,\nThe health hazards associated with uranium are much\nthe same as those for lead.\nThe Earth's uranium (chemical symbol U) was apparently formed in\nsupernovae up to about 6.6 billion years ago (see information page\non The Cosmic Origins of Uranium). lts radioactive decay provides\nthe main source of heat inside the Earth, causing convection and\ncontinental drift. As decay proceeds, the final product, lead,\nincreases in relative abundance.\nUranium was discovered by Martin Klaproth, a German chemist, in\n1789 in the mineral pitchblende, and was named after the planet\nUranus. It occurs in most rocks in concentrations of 2 to 4 parts per\nmillion and is as common in the Earth's crust as tin, tungsten and privaoy Terms\nhittps:/Aworld-nuclear.org/information-library/nuclear-fuel-cycle/uranium-resources/uranium-and-depleted-uranium#:~itext=High-enriched uraniumatext... 1/17\n\n213/25, 4:26 AM Uranium and Depleted Uranium - World Nuclear Association\nmolybdenum and about 40 times as common as silver. Being\nrelatively soluble (in contrast to thorium), it is also found in the\noceans, at an average concentration of 3 parts per billion. There are\na number of locations in different parts of the world where it occurs\nin economically-recoverable concentrations. When mined, it yields a\nmixed uranium oxide product, U3Og. Uraninite, or pitchblende, is the\nmost common uranium mineral.\n\nNatural uranium is a mixture of isotopes, including a small\nproportion of one that is fissile — readily able to fission (split) to yield\nvastly more energy than any combustion process.\n\nIn the past, uranium was also used to colour glass (from as early as\n79 AD) and deposits were once mined in order to obtain its decay\nproduct, radium. This element was used in luminous paint,\nparticularly on the dials of watches and aircraft instruments up to\nthe 1950s, and in medicine for the treatment of disease.\n\nFor many years from the 1940s, virtually all of the uranium that\nwas mined was used in the production of nuclear weapons, but this\nceased to be the case in the 1970s. Today the only substantial use\nfor uranium is as fuel in nuclear reactors, mostly for electricity\ngeneration. Uranium-235 is the only naturally-occurring material\nwhich can sustain a fission chain reaction, releasing large amounts\nof energy.\n\nWhile nuclear power is the predominant use of uranium, heat from\nnuclear fission can be used for industrial processes. It is also used\nfor marine propulsion (mostly naval). And small nuclear reactors are\nimportant for making radioisotopes.\n\nThe uranium atom\n\nUranium is one of the heaviest of all the naturally-occurring\nelements and has a specific gravity of 18.7. Its melting point is\n1132°C.\n\nLike other elements, uranium occurs in slightly differing forms\nknown as isotopes. These isotopes differ from each other in the\nnumber of neutron particles in the nucleus. Natural uranium (Unat)\nas found in the Earth's crust is a mixture of three isotopes: uranium-\n238 (U-238), accounting for 99.275%; U-235 — 0.720%; and traces\nof U-234 — 0.005%, [\n\nhitps:#world-nuclear.org/information-library/nuctear-fuel-cycle/uranium-resources/uranium-and-depleted-uranium#:~:text=High-enriched uranium@text... 2/17\n\n213/25, 4:26 AM Uranium and Depleted Uranium - World Nuclear Association\nThe isotope U-235 is important because under certain conditions it\ncan readily be split, yielding a lot of energy. It is therefore said to be\n‘fissile’. Meanwhile, like all radioactive isotopes, it decays. U-238\ndecays very slowly, its half-life? being about the same as the age of\nthe Earth. This means that it is barely radioactive, less so than\nmany other radioisotopes in rocks and sand. Uranium-238 has a\nspecific radioactivity of 12.4 kBa/g, and U-235 80 kBa/g, but the\nsmaller amount of U-234 is very active (231 MBq/g} so the specific\nradioactivity of natural uranium (25 kBq/g) is about double that of\nU-238 despite it consisting of over 99% U-238.° In decay it\ngenerates 0.1 watts/tonne and this is enough to warm the Earth's\nmanile.\nUranium fission\nThe nucleus of the U-235 isotope comprises 92 protons and 143\nneutrons (92 + 143 = 235}. When the nucleus of a U-235 atom is\nsplit in two by a neutron’, some energy is released in the form of\nheat, and two or three additional neutrons are thrown off. If enough\nof these expelled neutrons split the nuclei of other U-235 atoms,\nreleasing further neutrons, a chain reaction can be achieved. When\nthis happens over and over again, many millions of times, a very\nlarge amount of heat is produced from a relatively small amount of\nuranium.\nIt is this process, in effect 'purning' uranium, which occurs in a\nnuclear reactor. In a nuclear reactor the uranium fuel is assembled\nin such a way that a controlled fission chain reaction can be\nachieved. The heat created by splitting the U-235 atoms is then\nused to make steam which spins a turbine to drive a generator,\nproducing electricity.\nWhereas the U-235 atom is ‘fissile’, the U-238 atom is said to be\n‘fertile’. This means that it can capture a neutron and become\n{indirectly) plutonium-239, which is fissile. Pu-239 is very much like\nU-235, in that it can fission following neutron capture, also yielding\na lot of energy’. Because there is so much U-238 in a reactor core\n(most of the fuel), these reactions occur frequenily, and in fact about\none-third of the energy yield typically comes from burning bred Pu-\n239*. A very small amount of U-238 also fissions from fast\nneutrons, contributing about 7% of the energy in a reactor.\n* In certain reactors fuelled with natural uranium, bred plutonium\nprovides about 60% of the energy.\n\nhitps;/Aworld-nuclear.org/information-library/nuclear-fuel-cycle/uranium-resources/uranium-and-depleted-uranium#:~:text=High-enriched uraniumé&text.... 3/17,\n\n213/25, 4:26 AM Uranium and Depleted Uranium - World Nuclear Association\nBoth uranium and plutonium were used to make bombs before they\nbecame important for making electricity and radioisotopes. But the\ntype of uranium and plutonium for bombs is different from that in a\nnuclear power plant. Bomb-grade uranium is highly enriched\n(>90% U-235, instead of about 3.5-5.0% in a power plant); bomb-\ngrade plutonium is fairly pure (>90%) Pu-239 and is made in\nspecial reactors.\nUranium as a fuel for nuclear power\nAbout 10% of the world's electricity is generated from uranium in\nnuclear reactors. This amounts to over 2600 billion kWh, as much\nas from all sources worldwide a few decades ago. It comes from\nabout 440 nuclear reactors with a total output capacity of about\n390,000 MWe operating in 32 countries plus Taiwan. Over 50 more\nreactors are under construction and about another 100 are\nplanned2, A typical 1000 megawatt (MWe) reactor can provide\nenough electricity for a modern city of close to one million people,\nabout 8 billion kWh per year.\nA dozen countries get 25% or more of their electricity from nuclear\nreactors. Germany and Japan have derived a similar amount of their\nelectricity from uranium in the past. The USA has over 90 reactors\noperating, supplying 20% of its electricity3. France generates about\n70% of its electricity from nuclear power.\nNuclear power stations and fossil-fuelled power stations of similar\ncapacity have many features in common. Both require heat to\nproduce steam to drive turbines and generators. In a nuclear power\nstation, however, the fissioning of uranium atoms replaces the\nburning of coal or gas. The chain reaction that takes place in the\ncore of a nuclear reactor is controlled by rods which absorb\nneutrons. They are inserted or withdrawn to set the reactor at the\nrequired power level. The fuel elements are surrounded by a\nsubstance called a moderator to slow the speed of the emitted\nneutrons and thus enable the chain reaction to continue®. Water,\ngraphite and heavy water are used as moderators in different types\nof reactors.\nSources of uranium\n\nhitps:/world-nuclear.org/information-library/nuclear-fuel-cycle/uranium-resources/uranium-and-depleted-uranium#~:text=High-enriched uranium&text... 4/47\n\n213/25, 4:26 AM Uranium and Depleted Uranium - World Nuclear Association\nUranium is widespread in many rocks, and even in seawater.\nHowever, like other metals, it is seldom sufficiently concentrated to\nbe economically recoverable. Where it is, we speak of an orebody.\nUranium is fairly soluble and uranium oxide precipitates from\nurdnium-bearing groundwaters when they enter a reducing\nenvironment. It can be mobilized (re-dissolved) in situ from such\nplacer deposits by oxygenated leach solution.\n\nIn defining what is ore, assumptions are made about the cost of\nmining and the market price of the metal. Known uranium resources\nare therefore calculated as tonnes recoverable up to a certain cost.\nAustralia's uranium resources are over 25% of the world's total, and\nKazakhstan is the world's leading source, contributing more than\none-third of world production. Other countries with significant\nknown resources include Russian Federation, Canada South Africa,\nNamibia, and Niger. Many more countries have smaller deposits\nwhich could be mined. (See information page on Supply of\nUranium).\nUranium is sold only to countries which are signatories of the\nNuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty, and which allow international\ninspection to verify that it is used only for peaceful purposes. (See\ninformation page on Safeguards.)\nFrom uranium ore to reactor fuel\nUranium ore can be mined by underground or open-cut methods,\ndepending on its depth. After mining, the ore is crushed and ground\nup. Then it is treated with acid to dissolve the uranium, which is\nthen recovered from solution. Uranium may also be mined by in situ\nleaching (ISL), where it is dissolved from the orebody in situ and\npumped to the surface.\nThe end product of the mining and milling stages, or ISL, is uranium\noxide concentrate (U30g)*. Before it can be used in a reactor for\nelectricity generation, however, it must undergo a series of\nprocesses to produce a useable fuel.\n* U3Q0¢ is a stable complex oxide: U205.U03.\nFor most of the world's reactors, the next step in making a useable\nfuel is to convert the uranium oxide into a gas, uranium hexafluoride\n(UFe), which enables it to be enriched’, Enrichment increases the\nproportion of the U-235 isotope from its natural level of 0.7% to 3-\nhitps:/Aworld-nuclear.org/information-library/nuclear-fuel-cycle/uranium-resources/uranium-and-depleted-uranium#:~:text=High-enriched uraniumé&text.... 5/17.\n\n213/25, 4:26 AM Uranium and Depleted Uranium - World Nuclear Association\n5% (see information page on Uranium Enrichment). This enables\ngreater technical efficiency in reactor design and operation,\nparticularly in larger reactors, and allows the use of ordinary water\nas a moderator. A by-product (sometimes considered a waste\nproduct) of enrichment is depleted uranium (about 86% of the\noriginal feed). This, largely U-238, has potential use in fast neutron\nreactors.\nAfter enrichment, the UFs gas is converted to uranium dioxide (UO)\nwhich is formed into fuel pellets. These fuel pellets are placed inside\nthin metal tubes which are assembled in bundles to become the\nfuel elements for the core of the reactor. UO2 has a very high\nmelting point — 2865°C {compared with uranium metal — 1132°C).\nUsed reactor fuel is removed from the reactor and stored, either to\nbe reprocessed or disposed of in deep geological repositories.\nThe uranium orebody contains both U-235 and (mostly) U-238.\nAbout 95% of the radioactivity in the ore is from the U-238 decay\nseries. This has 14 radioactive isotopes in secular equilibriurn, thus\neach represents 7% of the total. (In the case of Ranger ore - with\n0.3% U3Qg it has about 450 kBa/kg, so irrespective of the mass\nproportion, 32 kBq/kg per nuclide in that decay series.) When the\nore is processed, the U-238 and the very much smaller masses of\nU-234 (and the U-235) are removed. The balance becomes tailings,\nand at this point has about 86% of its original intrinsic radioactivity.\nHowever, with the removal of most U-238, the following two shori-\nlived decay products (Th-234 & Pa-234) soon disappear, leaving\nthe tailings with a little over 70% of the radio-activity of the original\nore after several months. The controlling long-lived isotope then\nbecomes Th-230 which decays with a half life of 77,000 years to\nradium-226 followed by radon-222.\nRecycled (reprocessed) uranium\nUranium comprises about 96% of used fuel. When used fuel is\nreprocessed, both plutonium and uranium are usually recovered\nseparately.\nUranium recovered from reprocessing used nuclear fuel (RepU) is\nmostly U-238 with about 1% U-235, so it needs to be converted\nand re-enriched for recycling into most reactors. This is complicated\nby the presence of impurities? and two isotopes in particular, U-232 |\n\nhitps;//world-nuclear.org/information-library/nuclear-fuel-cycle/uranium-resources/uranium-and-depleted-uranium#:~:text=High-enriched uraniumé&text.... 6/17.\n\n213/25, 4:26 AM Uranium and Depleted Uranium - World Nuclear Association\nand U-236, which are formed by or following neutron capture in the\nreactor, and increase with higher burn-up levels\".\nU-232 here is largely a decay product of Pu-236, and increases\nwith storage time in used fuel, peaking at about ten years. Both U-\n232 and U-236 decay much more rapidly than U-235 and U-238,\nand one of the daughter products of U-232 emits very strong\ngamma radiation, which means that shielding is necessary in any\nplant handling material with more than very small traces of it. U-\n236, comprising about 0.5% of recovered uranium, is a neutron\nabsorber which impedes the chain reaction, and means that a\nhigher level of U-235 enrichment is required in the product to\ncompensate.\nBecause they are lighter than U-238, both U-232 and U-236 tend\nto concenirate in the enriched (rather than depleted) output, so\nreprocessed uranium (RepU) that is re-enriched for fuel must be\nsegregated from enriched fresh uranium. Enriched RepU has an\nactivity of over 250 kBa/g, which compares with 82 kBq/g (most of\nthis being from U-234) for enriched fresh uranium. The presence of\nU-236 in particular means that the U-235 enrichment level needs\nto be a bit higher than for fresh uranium, and most reprocessed\nuranium can normally be recycled only once. In the future, laser\nenrichment techniques may be able to remove these difficult\nisotopes.\n=p =|. —+] ——, ———. —\nHigh-enriched uranium\nIn October 2015 the Institute for Science and International Security\n{ISIS} reported that there was about 134 tonnes of civilian stocks of\nhigh-enriched uranium (HEU) worldwide at the end of 2014. The\nnumber of countries holding stocks of 1 kg or more of HEU stood at\n29 then, but this has since fallen to 26.

The\nirradiated fuel can then be unloaded from the reactor, the U-233\nseparated from the thorium, and fed back into another reactor as\npart of a closed fuel cycle. Alternatively, thorium can be\nincorporated into the fuel salt of a molten salt reactor (MSR) and the\nU-233 burned as it is bred. (See information page on MSRs.)\nU-233 has higher neutron yield per neutron absorbed than U-235\nor Pu-239. Given a start with some other fissile material (U-233, U-\n235 or Pu-239) as a driver, a breeding cycle similar to but more\nefficient than that with U-238 and plutonium (in conventional\nthermal neutron reactors) can be set up. U-233 has a 95%\nprobability of fission when struck by a neutron of any energy level\n{a higher probability than Pu-239), though some U-234 is formed.\nThe driver fuels provide all the neutrons initially, but are\nprogressively supplemented by U-233 as it forms from the thorium.\nHowever, the intermediate product protactinium-233 (Pa-233) is a\nneutron absorber which diminishes U-233 yield. (See information\npage on Thorium).\nSpecifically: Th-232 gains a neutron to form Th-233, which soon\nbeta decays (hali-life 22 minutes) to protactinium-233. The Pa-233\n(half-life of 27 days) decays into U-233. Some U-232 is also formed\nalong with Th-233, and a decay product of this is very gamma\nactive. Chemical separation of the protactinium from irradiated\nthorium would minimize U-232 contamination of the ultimate U-\n233. The chemical separation is not as straightforward as the\nPurex process used to separate U & Pu from used power reactor\nhitps://world-nuclear.org/information-library/nuclear-fuel-cycle/uranium-resources/uranium-and-depleted-uranium#:~itext=High-enriched uraniumétext... 8/17\n\n213/25, 4:26 AM Uranium and Depleted Uranium - World Nuclear Association\nuranium fuel, and it has not been demonstrated beyond bench\nscale. (Incidentally, more than about 50 ppm U-232 in U-233\nrenders it unsuitable for weapons.)\n\nOther uses of uranium-fuelled reactors\nThere are also other uses for uranium-fuelled nuclear reactors. Over\n200 small nuclear reactors power more than 150 ships, mostly\nsubmarines, but ranging from icebreakers to aircraft carriers. These\ncan stay at sea for very long periods without having to make\nrefuelling stops. In most such vessels the steam drives a turbine\ndirectly geared to propulsion.\n\nThe heat produced by nuclear reactors can also be used directly\nrather than for generating electricity. In Russia, for example, it is\nused to heat buildings and elsewhere it provides heat for a variety\nof industrial processes such as water desalination. In the future,\nhigh-temperature reactors could be used for industrial processes\nsuch as thermochemical production of hydrogen. (See information\npage on Hydrogen Production and Uses).\n\nRadioisotope production in uranium fuelled reactors\nRadioactive materials (radioisotopes) play a key role in the\ntechnologies that provide us with food, water and good health and\nhave become a vital part of modern life. They are produced by\nbombarding small amounts of particular elements with neutrons.\nUsing relatively small special purpose nuclear reactors (usually\ncalled research reactors), a wide range of radioisotopes can be\nmade at low cost. The use of radioisotopes has become\nwidespread since the early 1950s, and there are now some 280\nresearch reactors in 56 countries producing them.\n\nIn medicine, radioisotopes are widely used for diagnosis, and also\nfor treatment and research. Radioactive chemical tracers emit\ngamma radiation which provides diagnostic information about a\nperson's anatomy and the functioning of specific organs.\nRadiotherapy also employs radioisotopes in the treatment of some\nillnesses, such as cancer. More powerful gamma sources are used\nto sterilize syringes, bandages and other medical equipment. About\none in two people in Western countries is likely to experience the\nbenefits of nuclear medicine in their lifetime, and gamma\n\nhitps;//world-nuclear.org/information-library/nuclear-fuel-cycle/uranium-resources/uranium-and-depleted-uranium#:~:text=High-enriched uraniumé&text.... 9/17,\n\n213/25, 4:26 AM Uranium and Depleted Uranium - World Nuclear Association\nsterilisation of equipment is almost universal. (See information page\non Radioisotopes in Medicine.)\n\nIn the preservation of food, radioisotopes are used to inhibit the\nsprouting of root crops after harvesting, to kill parasites and pests,\nand to control the ripening of stored fruit and vegetables. Irradiated\nfoodstuffs are accepted by world and national health authorities for\nhuman consumption in an increasing number of countries. They\ninclude potatoes, onions, dried and fresh fruits, grain and grain\nproducts, poultry and some fish. Some prepacked foods can also be\nirradiated.\n\nAgriculturally, in the growing crops and breeding livestock,\nradioisotopes also play an important role. They are used to produce\nhigh-yielding, disease- and weather-resistant varieties of crops, to\nstudy how fertilizers and insecticides work, and to improve the\nproductivity and health of domestic animals. Industrially, and in\nmining, they are used to examine welds, to detect leaks, to study\nthe rate of wear of metals, and for on-stream analysis of a wide\nrange of minerals and fuels. (See information page on\nRadicisotopes in Industry.)\n\nEnvironmentally, radioisotopes are used to trace and analyse\npollutants, to study the movement of surface water, and to measure\nwater runoffs from rain and snow, as well as the flow rates of\nstreams and rivers.\n\nMost household smoke detectors use a radioisotope (americium-\n241) derived from the plutonium formed in nuclear reactors. These\nalarms save many lives.\n\nDepleted uranium\n\nEvery tonne of natural uranium produced and enriched for use in a\nnuclear reactor gives about 130 kg of enriched fuel (3.5% or more\nU-235). The balance is depleted uranium tails (U-238, typically with\n0.22% U-235 if from Western enrichment plants, 0.10% from\nRussian ones). This major portion has been depleted in its fissile U-\n235 isotope (and, incidentally, U-234) by the enrichment process. It\nis commonly known as DU if the focus is on the actual material, or\nenrichment tails if the focus is on its place in the fuel cycle and its\nU-235 assay.\n\nDU tails are either stored as UF¢ or {especially in France and now |\nalso Russia and the USA) deconverted back to U3Og, which is more\n\nhitps;//world-nuclear.org/information-library/nuclear-fuel-cycle/uranium-resources/uranium-and-depleted-uranium#.~:text=High-enriched uraniuméte,.. 10/17\n\n213/25, 4:26 AM Uranium and Depleted Uranium - World Nuclear Association\nbenign chemically and thus more suited for long-term storage. It is\nalso less chemically toxic. Every year over 50,000 tonnes of\ndepleted uranium joins already substantial stockpiles in the USA,\nEurope and Russia. World stock is about 1.6 million tonnes.\nSome DU is drawn from these stockpiles to dilute high-enriched\n{>90%) uranium released from weapons programs, particularly in\nRussia, and destined for use in civil reactors (see information page\non Military Warheads as a Source of Nuclear Fuel). This weapons-\ngrade material is diluted about 25:1 with depleted uranium, or 29:1\nwith depleted uranium that has been enriched slightly (to 1.5% U-\n235) to minimize levels of (natural} U-234 in the product.\nSome, assaying 0.25-0.40% U-235 fram historic enrichment, has\nbeen sent to Russia for re-enrichment, using surplus plant capacity\nthere to produce either natural uranium equivalent or low-enriched\nuranium (4-5% U-235).\nThe main current use for DU is used in mixed oxide (MOX) fuel, by\nmixing with plutonium (see information page on Mixed Oxide (MOX),\nEuel).\nPotentially DU can be used as fuel in future generations of fast\nneutron reactors. In the long-term perspective it thus needs to be\nseen as d resource.\nOther uses depend on the metal's very high density (1.7 times that\nof lead). Hence, where maximum mass must fit in minimum space,\nsuch as aircraft control surface and helicopter counterweights,\nyacht keels, etc, it is often well suited. Until the mid 1970s it was\nused in dental porcelains. In addition it is used for radiation\nshielding in hospital and industrial radiography, being some five\ntimes more effective than lead in this role (in Australia some 6\ntonnes is used thus, in about 60 items of equipment).\nAlso because of its density, it is used as solid slugs or penetrators in\narmour-piercing projectiles, alloyed with abut 0.75% titanium. DU is\npyrophoric, so that upon impact about 30% of the projectile\natomizes and burns to uranium oxide dust. It was widely used in\nthe 1990/91 Gulf War {300 tonnes) and less so in the 1998/99\nKosovo War (11 tonnes). As well as ground-based artillery, the A-\n10 ‘Warthog’ aircraft can fire 30mm DU armour-piercing rounds.\nHealth aspects of DU |\n\nhitps:/world-nuclear.org/information-library/nuclear-fuel-cycle/uranium-resources/uranium-and-depleted-uranium#~:text=High-enriched uraniumate... 11/47\n\n213/25, 4:26 AM Uranium and Depleted Uranium - World Nuclear Association\nDepleted uranium is not classified as a dangerous substance\nradiologically, though it is a potential hazard in large quantities,\nbeyond what could conceivably be breathed. Its emissions are very\nlow, since the half-life of U-238 is the same as the age of the Earth\n(4.5 billion years). There are no reputable reports of cancer or other\nnegative health effects from radiation exposure to ingested or\ninhaled natural or depleted uranium, despite much study.\n\nHowever, uranium does have a chemical toxicity about the same as\nthat of lead, so inhaled furne or ingested oxide is considered a\nhealth hazard. Most uranium actually absorbed into the body is\nexcreted within days, the balance being laid down in bone and\nkidneys. Its biological effect is principally kidney damage. The World\nHealth Organization {WHO} has set a tolerable daily intake level for\nuranium of 0.6 microgram/kg body weight, orally. (This is about\neight times our normal background intake from natural sources.)\nStandards for drinking water and concentrations in air are set\naccordingly.\n\nLike most radionuclides, it is not known as a carcinogen, or to cause\nbirth defects (from effects in utero) or to cause genetic mutations.\nRadiation from DU munitions depends on how long since the\nuranium has been separated from the lighter isotopes so that its\ndecay products start to build up. Decay of U-238 gives rise to Th-\n234, Pa-234 (beta emitters) and U-234 (an alpha emitter)k. On this\nbasis, in a few months, DU is weakly radioactive with an activity of\naround 40 kBa/g quoted. (If it is fresh from the enrichment plant and\nhence fairly pure, the activity is 15 kBa/g, compared with 25 kBa/g\nfor pure natural uranium. Fresh DU from enriching reprocessed\nuranium has U-236 in it and more U-234 so is about 23 kBq/g.}\n\nIn 2001, the UN Environment Programme {UNEP) examined the\neffects of nine tonnes of DU munitions having been used in Kosovo,\nchecking the sites targeted by it4. UNEP found no widespread\ncontamination, no sign of contamination in water of the food chain\nand no correlation with reported ill-health in NATO peacekeepers. A\ntwo-year study® by Sandia National Laboratories in USA reported\nin 2005 that consistent with earlier studies!, reports of serious\nhealth risks from DU exposure during the 1991 Gulf War are not\nsupported by medical statistics or by analysis.\n\nAn editorial in the Radiological Protection Bulletin of the UK's\nNational Radiation Protection Board stated: \"DU is radioactive and\ndoses from inhalation of dust or from handling bare spent rounds\nneed io be assessed properly. However, the scientific consensus at\npresent is that the risks are likely to be small and easily avoidable,\n\nhitps;//world-nuclear.org/information-library/nuclear-fuel-cycle/uranium-resources/uranium-and-depleted-uranium#.~:text=High-enriched uraniuméte,.. 1247\n\n213/25, 4:26 AM Uranium and Depleted Uranium - World Nuclear Association\nespecially compared with the other risks the armed forces have to\ntake in war.\"®\nThus DU is clearly dangerous for military targets, but for anyone\nelse — even in a war zone — there is little hazard. Ingestion or\ninhalation of uranium oxide dust resulting from the impact of DU\nmunitions on their targets is the main possible exposure route.\nOther forms of uranium, legacy materials\nAs well as natural uranium, enriched uranium, depleted uranium\ntails and reprocessed uranium, there are other forms of it, some as\nlegacy materials arising from military processing.\n\nSlightly irradiated uranium (SIU, 0.65% U-235 in Russia) arises from\nmilitary plutonium production with low burn-up of natural uranium,\nafter reprocessing to separate that plutonium (essentially Pu-239).\nIf SIU is enriched, the product can readily be used in nuclear plants\nand the tails become DSIU, with lower content of even uranium\nisotopes (232, 234, 236) than normal RepU, hence more valuable.\nNotes & references\n\nNotes\n\na. The half-life is the time it takes for a radionuclide to lose half of its\nown radioactivity. [Back]\n\nb. The becquerel (Bq) is a unit or measure of actual radioactivity in\nmaterial (as distinct from the radiation it emits), with reference to\nthe number of nuclear disintegrations per second (1 Bg =1\ndisintegration/sec). For further information on units of radioactivity\nsee the Units of radiation and radioactivity section in the\ninformation page on Nuclear Radiation and Health Effects [Back\n\nc. U-235 can fission following capture of a low-energy (or ‘thermal’\nneutron to form a new compound nucleus, which then splits into\ntwo daughter fragments and two or three neutrons (average\naround 2.5), releasing energy in the process.

Sometimes Pu-239 simply captures a neutron without splitting,\nand it becomes Pu-240. Because the Pu-2339 is either progressively\nburned or becomes Pu-240, the longer the fuel stays in the reactor\nthe more Pu-240 accumulates in it. The significance of this is that\nwhen the used fuel is removed after about three years, the\nplutonium in it is not suitable for making weapons — because Pu-\n240 has a relatively high rate of spontaneous fission — but can be\nrecycled as fuel. (See also information page on Plutonium). [Back]\ne. Neutrons released in fission are initially fast (velocity about 10%\nem/s, or energy above 1 MeV), but fission in U-235 is most readily\ncaused by slow (thermal) neutrons (velocity about 105 cm/s, or\nenergy about 0.02 eV). A moderator material comprising light\natoms thus surrounds the fuel rods in a reactor to slow down the\nneutrons in elastic collisions. (See also information page on Physics\nof Nuclear Energy) [Back\nf. For reactors which use natural uranium as their fuel (and which\nrequire graphite or heavy water as a moderator} the\nU30g concentrate simply needs to be refined and converted directly\nto uranium dioxide. [Back]\ng. Recovered uranium (especially from earlier military reprocessing)\nmay be contaminated with traces of fission products. Over 2002-06\nUSEC cleaned up 7400 tonnes of technetium-contaminated\nuranium from the US Department of Energy. [Back\nh. Recovered uranium also contains a higher proportion of U-234\nthan fresh reactor fuel. As well as having a greater specific activity\nthan both U-235 and U-238, the presence of U-234 alters the\nreactivity as it absorbs neutrons. [Back]\ni. Neutron absorption by Th-232 produces Th-233, which has a\nhalf-life of about 22 minutes. This undergoes beta decay to form\nPa-233 (half-life 27 days), most of which forms U-233 by further\nbeta decay. Around 11% of the U-233 is converted by further\nneutron absorption to U-235, which is the fissile isotope of uranium\nused in conventional nuclear reactors. A small amount of the Pa-\n233 and U-233 forms U-232 in the reactor. Separated U-233 is\ntherefore always contaminated with traces of U-232, which has a\n69-year half-life but whose daughter productsi, particularly\nthallium-208, are strong gamma emitters with very short half-lives.\nThis creates significant problems in handling the bred U-233 and\nmakes it easy to detect, hence conferring proliferation resistance.\nBack)\n\nhitps:/Aworld-nuclear.org/information-library/nuclear-fuel-cycle/uranium-resources/uranium-and-depleted-uranium#~:text=High-enriched uraniumate... 14/47\n\n213/25, 4:26 AM Uranium and Depleted Uranium - World Nuclear Association\nJ. The decay chain of U-232 has six short-lived decay products\nbefore TI-208, which precedes stable Pb-208. [Back]\nk, U-238 {half-life 4.5 billion years) decays to thorium-234 (half-life\n24 days), which beta decays to protactinium-234 (half-life one\nminute}, which beta decays to U-234 {alpha emitter, half-life\n246,000 years). [Back\n|. For example, a 2001 paper by the Australasian Radiation\nProtection Society (ARPS), which quotes several studies, concludes\nthat health risks associated with the levels of DU exposure\nexperienced during the Gulf War are essentially zero. A summary of\nthe ARPS statement reads as follows:\nSome military personnel involved in the 1991 Gulf War complained\nof continuing stress-like symptoms for which no obvious cause was\nfound. These symptoms were at times attributed to the use of\ndepleted uranium in shells and other missiles, which are said to\nhave caused toxic effects. Similar complaints arose from later\nfighting in the Balkans (Kosovo). Because of the latency period for\nthe induction of cancer by radiation, it is not credible that any cases\nof radiation-induced cancer could in the short term be attributed to\nthe Kosovo conflict. Furthermore, extensive studies have concluded\nthat no radiological health hazard should be expected from\nexposure to depleted uranium. The risk from external exposure is\nessentially zero, even when pure metal is handled. No detectable\nincreases of cancer, leukaemia, birth defects or other negative\nhealth effects have ever been observed from radiation exposure to\ninhaled or ingested natural uranium concentrates, at levels far\nexceeding those likely in areas where DU munitions have been\nused. This is mainly because the low radioactivity per unit mass of\nuranium means that the mass needed for significant internal\nexposure would be virtually impossible to accumulate in the body —\nand DU is less than half as radioactive as natural uranium.
