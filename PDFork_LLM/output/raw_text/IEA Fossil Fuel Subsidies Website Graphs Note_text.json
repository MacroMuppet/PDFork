Those for natural gas and electricity consumption\nmore than doubled compared with 2021, while oil subsidies rose by around\n85%. The total value of subsidies declined in 2023 as some government\n\nprovisions expired. Meanwhile, many others are tied directly to energy\nprices, which pulled back from record highs in many parts of the world.\nHowever, fossil fuel subsidies for consumers remain elevated compared\nwith their historical averages.\n\nWhile subsidies generally aim to make energy more affordable for\nconsumers, many are poorly targeted and disproportionately benefit\nhigher-income groups. Our data and analysis provide crucial insights for\npolicy makers looking to pivot away from inefficient fossil fuel subsidies, a\nkey objective set at forums such as COP and the G20.\n\nKey findings\n\nDistortions in today’s energy system favour\nincumbent fuels\n\nThe need to keep energy affordable is a reason why many governments\nintervene to keep regulated fuel and electricity prices low. During the\nglobal energy crisis, short-term affordability measures soared. By April\n2023, these expenditures reached some $900 billion in direct grants,\nvouchers, tax reductions and price regulations.\n\nIn 2023, governments — especially in emerging and developing economies\n- continued to heavily subsidise the use of fossil fuels, spending $620\nbillion. This amount is significantly above the $70 billion that was spent on\nsupport for consumer-facing clean energy investments including grants or\nrebates for electric vehicles, efficiency improvements or heat pumps.\nStrategies for Affordable and Fair Clean Energy Transitions ©\n\n2114125, 450 PM Fossil Fuel Subsiles ~ Topics - IEA\nFossil fuel consumption subsidies, 2015-2023 Open\nbillion USD (2023, MER)\nQQ OCS\n280... $ SS oan. — STS sa _—oo\n000.

This surge was a result of\ndisruptions in energy markets that led to international fuel prices\nsurpassing the actual costs paid by many consumers. The unprecedented\nsubsidies in 2022 were double those of 2021, which were already almost\nfive times higher than the levels recorded in 2020. This jump was\nparticularly pronounced due to the global energy crisis triggered by\nRussia's invasion of Ukraine. The IEA has long advocated removing or at\nleast reducing fossil fuel subsidies because they distort markets, send the\nwrong price signals to users, widen fiscal deficits in emerging and\ndeveloping economies, and discourage the adoption of cleaner renewable\nenergies.\n\nThe global energy crisis pushed fossil fuel consumption subsidies to an (6)\nall-time high in 2022\n\n2114/25, 4:50 PM Fossil Fuel Subsidies — Topics - IEA\nValue of fossil-fuel subsidies by fuel in the top 25 countries, 2022 Open\nhttps:/Avww.iea.org/topics/fossil-fuel-subsidies BA2\n\n2114/25, 4:50 PM Fossil Fuel Subsidies — Topics - IEA\nhttps:/Awww.iea.org/topics/fossil-fuel-subsidies 62\n\n2114125, 450 PM Fossil Fuel Subsiles ~ Topics - IEA\nbillion USD\n0 50 100 150 200\nI Ly U\nRussia\nIran p |__| __] O\nChina a\nSaudiArabia a\nEgypt po fe)\nInda | O J[[ |\nAlgeria J (e)\nIndonesia | O | |\nuAE [|__| a\nKazakhstan |_| [|_| 1)\nVietnam [Ll] 0 |\nPakistan |_| |] O\nBangladesh | [| _|o\nUzbekistan [| [| oO\nrag | ~L| OO\nKuwait |] |_| O\nArgentina | 1d]\nUkraine |_| | O\nNigeria | [TO\nMalaysia |__ [o\nTurkmenistan || [| O\nVenezuela || | O\nLibya | | O\nAzerbaijan [|] O\nQatar [|] O\n0 10 20 30 40\n\n2114/25, 4:50 PM Fossil Fuel Subsidies — Topics - IEA\nshare of GDP (MER)\nIEA.
