The\nconundrum of how to meet that requirement for clean, reliable, and secure\nbase-load energy only has one real answer: nuclear.\nThree things that suggest this is just the start of a tech and nuclear\npartnership powering the Al revolution:\nCoalition of the ambitious provides certainty to end users and the\nsupply chain\nLike any major infrastructure project, political and financial support are\nparamount in decision making and providing certainty to the supply chain.\nThis support has never been clearer with the goal to triple global nuclear\ncapacity by 2050 announced by 25 countries at COP28 last year, endorsed\nby the nuclear industry through the @Net Zero Nuclear initiative, and\nsupported by 14 major global banks and financial institutions less than a\nmonth ago. There is now a coalition of the ambitious ready to collaborate\nwith the end energy users who are asking for nuclear power plants - the\nadage “if you build it, they will come” seems to be reversing \"If they come,\nwe'll build it’.\nThis is the beginning of a wave, with electricity demand rising\nThe International Energy Agency (IEA) World Energy Outlook last week\nforecast a sixfold increase in eleciricity demand by 2050. The IEA’s\nExecutive Director Fatih Birol described us as entering the “Age of\nElectricity*. While the need for this increased electrification is undeniable,\nelectricity is an energy vector so we will need a mix of clean energy\nsources to generate it.

The leaders and winner of this Al revolution will be those that can\nprovide clean and reliable energy, so you can expect countries investing in\ntheir nuclear energy capabilities to have a head start.\nGlobal demand for clean electricity is set to rise dramatically over the\ncoming decades, driven by the need to decarbonize, to power economic\ndevelopment and meet the needs of almost a billion people still without\nregular access to electricity.\nThe emergence of data centres as a major new source of demand for clean\nelectricity has only strengthened the imperative to accelerate deployment\nof clean electricity capacity, and the significant role of nuclear energy.
