Weapons-grade plutonium has over 93% Pu-239 and can be\nused, like reactor-grade plutonium, in fuel for electricity production.\nHighly-enriched uranium from weapons stockpiles has been displacing\nsome 8850 tonnes of U30g production from mines each year, and met\nabout 13% to 19% of world reactor requirements through to 2013.\n\nFor more than five decades, concern has centred on the possibility that uranium intended\n\nfor commercial nuclear power might be diverted for use in weapons. This gave way to a\n\nfocus on the role of military uranium as a major source of fuel for commercial nuclear\n\npower.\n\nPrivacy - Terms:\nhttps://world-nuclear.org/information-library/nuclear-fuel-cycle/uranium-resources/military-warheads-as-a-source-of-nuclear-fuel 16\n\n2113/25, 4:19 AM Military Warheads as a Source of Nuclear Fuel - World Nuclear Association\nSince 1987 the United States and countries of the former USSR have signed a series of\ndisarmament treaties to reduce the nuclear arsenals by about 80%.\nNuclear materials declared surplus to military requirements by the USA and Russia have\nbeen converted into fuel for commercial nuclear reactors. This continues. With the\ndisintegration of the Soviet Union, a unique opportunity arose to deploy military weapons\nmaterial for making electricity. A 1993 agreement covered essentially the enrichment\ncomponent of this material, but left unresolved the question of feed from mines, and a\n1999 agreement dealt with what happened to the feed material.\nThe main weapons material is highly enriched uranium (HEU), containing at least 20%\nuranium-235 (U-235) and usually about 90% U-235. HEU can be blended down with\nuranium containing low levels of U-235 to produce low-enriched uranium (LEU), less than\n5% U-235, fuel for power reactors. It is blended with depleted uranium (mosily U-238),\nnatural uranium (0.7% U-235}, or partially-enriched uranium.\nHighly-enriched uranium in US and Russian weapons and other military stockpiles\namounts to about 1500 tonnes*, equivalent to about seven times annual world mine\nproduction.\n* according to TradeTech: Russia 720 t +/- 120 t, USA 600t.\nWorld stockpiles of weapons-grade plutonium are reported to be some 260 tonnes, which\nif used in mixed oxide fuel in conventional reactors would be equivalent to a little over one\nyear’s world uranium production. Military plutonium can blended with uranium oxide to\nform mixed oxide (MOX) fuel.\nAfter LEU or MOX is burned in power reactors, the spent fuel is not suitable for weapons\nmanufacture.\nMegatons to Megawatts, the Russian HEU deal\nhttps://world-nuclear.org/information-library/nuclear-fuel-cycle/uranium-resources/military-warheads-as-a-source-of-nuclear-fuel 26\n\n2113/25, 4:19 AM Military Warheads as a Source of Nuclear Fuel - World Nuclear Association\nCommitments by the USA and Russia to convert nuclear weapons into fuel for electricity\nproduction was known as the Megatons to Megawatts program.\nSurplus weapons-grade HEU resulting from the various disarmament agreements led in\n1993 to an agreement between the US and Russian governments. Under this Russia\nwould convert 500 tonnes of HEU from warheads and military stockpiles (equivalent to\naround 20,000 bombs) to LEU to be bought by the USA for use in civil nuclear reactors.\nIn 1994, a US$13 billion implementing contract was signed between the US Enrichment\nCorporation (now USEC Inc) and Russia's Techsnabexport {Tenex) as executive agents for\nthe US and Russian governments. USEC purchased 500 tonnes of weapons-grade HEU\nover 20 years to 2013, at a rate of up to 30 tonnes/year from 1999. The HEU was\nprogressively blended down to 14,446 t of LEU in Russia, using 1.5% U-235 (re-enriched\ndepleted uranium tails), to restrict levels of U-234 and U-236 in the final product to\nwestern specifications.* USEC then sold the LEU to its utility customers as fuel. The LEU\nenrichment levels specified in the agreement were 3.6%, 4.0%, 4.4% and 4.95%, though it\nis understood that 4.4% was typical, and possibly that used in the later years of the\nagreement.\n* HEU metal is first removed from a warhead, machined into shavings, oxidized and fluorinated. The resulting highly\nenriched uranium hexafluoride is then mixed in a gaseous stream with slightly enriched uranium to form LEU suitable\nfor commercial nuclear reactors. The LEU is transferred to shipping cylinders and sent to a collection point in St.\nPetersburg, Russia. USEC took possession of the material there and shipped it to the USA where it was included in\nUSEC’s inventory for delivery to customers.\nIt was essentially an enrichment deal totalling about 90 million SWU. About 150,000 t of\nnatural uranium was exchanged for the LEU, of which 112,000 t sold on the market under\nthe terms of the 1999 feed agreement and 38,000 t sent to Russia. This is equivalent to an\naverage of 8850 t/yr of U30g from mines over the 20 years. In the latter years it supplied\nabout 13% of world uranium demand.\nOverall the blending down of 500 tonnes of Russian HEU resulted in about 14,446 tonnes\nof LEU over 20 years. This is equivalent to about 150,000 tonnes of natural U (177,000 t\nU30g), about 2.5 times annual world demand.\nhttps://world-nuclear.org/information-library/nuclear-fuel-cycle/uranium-resources/military-warheads-as-a-source-of-nuclear-fuel 36\n\n2113/25, 4:19 AM Military Warheads as a Source of Nuclear Fuel - World Nuclear Association\nIn 1999 a supplementary agreement addressed what should happen to the uranium feed\nfrom mines, against which the blended down LEU was supplied to customers. See section\nbelow on the 1999 Agreement.\nThe last of the 500 tonnes of HEU was downblended in August 2013 by Russia's\nElectroChemical Plant (ECP) at Zelenogorsk and shipped in November. Other plants\ninvolved in the project were Urals Electrochemical Combine at Novouralsk, Siberian\nChemical Combine at Seversk, Angarsk Electrolysis & Chemical Combine, and PA Mayak at\nOzersk. The whole deal is equivalent to 20,000 nuclear warheads and 89 million SWU.\nAccording to Tenex, total revenue was US$17 billion, including hard currency gains and the\ncost of natural uranium component.\nRussia has other military HEU which it may blend down for its own use, using simply\ndepleted uranium (giving a satisfactory grade of LEU for use in Russian reactors).\nUS HEU disposition\nFor its part, the US government initially declared just over 174 tonnes of HEU (of various\nenrichments} to be surplus from military stockpiles. Of this, USEC took delivery of 14.2\ntonnes in the form of uranium hexafluoride (UFg) containing around 75% U-235, and 50\ntonnes as uranium oxide or metal containing around 40% U-235. Downblending of the\nUF, was completed in 1998, to produce 387 tonnes of LEU. Some 13.5 tonnes of the HEU\noxide or metal had been processed by September 2001 to produce 140.3 tonnes of LEU. In\n2004 the Nuclear Regulatory Commission issued a licence for downblending 33 tonnes\nHEU by Nuclear Fuel Services in Tennessee and in 2005 the first delivery was made to a\nTVA power plant.\nDOE's National Nuclear Security Administration (NNSA)* in 2005 announced plans to\nremove a further 200 tonnes of HEU from military stockpiles. Of this, 160 tonnes was\nretained for naval propulsion, thus postponing the need for building a new uranium high-\nenrichment facility for at least 50 years. An additional 20 tonnes was reserved for space\nmissions and for research reactors. The final 20 tonnes was to be downblended to LEU for\nhttps://world-nuclear.org/information-library/nuclear-fuel-cycle/uranium-resources/military-warheads-as-a-source-of-nuclear-fuel ANG\n\n2113/25, 4:19 AM Military Warheads as a Source of Nuclear Fuel - World Nuclear Association\nresearch reactors, power generation and for 17 tonnes, the new reliable fuel supply\ninitiative (see below).\n* Established by Congress in 2000, NNSA is a separately organized agency within the U.S. Department of Energy\nresponsible for enhancing national security through the military application of nuclear science. NNSA maintains and\nenhances the safety, security, reliability and performance of the U.S. nuclear weapons stockpile without nuclear testing;\nworks to reduce global danger from weapons of mass destruction: provides the U.S. Navy with safe and effective\nnuclear propulsion; and responds to nuclear and radiological emergencies in the United States and abroad.\nAlso in 2005, NNSA said that it was committing about 40 tonnes of off-specification HEU\n(with elevated levels of U-236) to the Blended Low-Enriched Uranium (BLEU) program.\nThis material would be used by TVA. In 2008 NNSA was negotiating with TVA to release a\nfurther 21 tonnes of HEU under the program, which would yield about 250 tonnes of LEU,\nsome of which might be sold to other utilities,\nIn mid-2007 the NNSA awarded contracts to Nuclear Fuel Services and Wesdyne\nInternational to downblend 17.4 tonnes of HEU from dismantled warheads to be part of a\nnew international fuel reserve. NFS downblended the material in Tennessee to yield some\n290 tonnes of LEU (4.95% U-235) by early 2012. Wesdyne, the prime contractor, is then\nstoring 230 tonnes of the LEU at the Westinghouse fuel fabrication plant in South Carolina\nto be available for the American Assured Fuel Supply (AFS) program. It will take about 60\ntonnes as payment in kind, to be sold on the market over a three to four year period. This\nfirst batch of LEU will be available for use in civilian reactors by nations in good standing\nwith the International Atomic Energy Agency that have good nonproliferation credentials\nand are not pursuing uranium enrichment and reprocessing technologies. It will also now\nbe available to domestic utilities. The fuel - worth some $500 million — will be sold at the\ncurrent market price.\nIn June 2009 NNSA awarded a further contract ($209 million) to NFS and Wesdyne for\n12.1 tonnes of HEU which will yield some 220 tonnes of LEU by 2012. This second batch\nof LEU is to provide fuel supply assurance for utilities which participate in DOE's mixed-\noxide fuel program utilising surplus plutonium from US weapons. (The AFS scheme is |\nconsistent with international concerns to limit the spread of enrichment technology to\n\nhttps://world-nuclear.org/information-library/nuclear-fuel-cycle/uranium-resources/military-warheads-as-a-source-of-nuclear-fuel 56\n\n2113/25, 4:19 AM Military Warheads as a Source of Nuclear Fuel - World Nuclear Association\n\ncountries without well-established nuclear fuel cycles. Russia has agreed to join the\ninitiative.)\nIn the short term most US military HEU is likely to be blended down to 20% U-235, then\nstored. In this form it is not useable for weapons.\nHow the Market Works\nNormally, a utility buys natural uranium from a mining company as \"yellowcake\" (U30¢)\nand has it converted to UFg. It then supplies this feed to USEC, paying them for the\nenrichment component. USEC runs its energy-intensive enrichment plant to separate an\nappropriate amount of enriched uranium (eg at 3.5 - 5.0% U-235, leaving a lot of depleted\nuranium). USEC then returns the enriched uranium to the utility for its reactor.\n\nnm <e (ERY Sto clistomers\n. Enrichment? *\n\n“customer? . vii Depleted j\n\nywatility eed arent:\nA different, and somewhat complicated, system is used for the Russian material. The utility\nsupplies the feed component of natural uranium as before and pays USEC for the\nenrichment componeni. But instead of running their plant, USEC pays the Russians for\nsome blended-down weapons uranium and passes this on to the customer utility as\n“enriched” uranium fuel. The customers receive the blended-down Russian material, paid\nfor as if it were their own uranium which had been enriched.\n\nhttps://world-nuclear.org/information-library/nuclear-fuel-cycle/uranium-resources/military-warheads-as-a-source-of-nuclear-fuel Bie\n\n2113/25, 4:19 AM Military Warheads as a Source of Nuclear Fuel - World Nuclear Association\n* Bown In,\n» Bussias\n“ xe saregitmety, TRB genres copper firey\ni, _ Warehouse ;: a {Uo edstomer! {\ncustomer”\nutility .. a\nA a =\nEN fs\nFeed tos\n4 stockpile: |\nUSEC pays Russia for the enrichment services component (basically energy) of the low-\nenriched product it receives. This amounts to about 5.5 million SWU per year. Russia takes\nownership of the corresponding amount of natural uranium \"feed\" provided to USEC by its\nutility customers for toll enrichment services. Under the 1999 agreement (below) at least\n72% of the feed is sold to Cameco, Areva and Nukern in the proportion 45/45/10, and the\nremainder is sent to Russia for domestic use there. In 2009 Rosatom said that its portion of\nthe natural uranium feed to date — worth US$ 2.7 billion — had been received in Russia.\n1999 Market Agreement re natural uranium feed to\nhttps://world-nuclear.org/information-library/nuclear-fuel-cycle/uranium-resources/military-warheads-as-a-source-of-nuclear-fuel THE\n\n2113/25, 4:19 AM Military Warheads as a Source of Nuclear Fuel - World Nuclear Association\n\nAfter years of stalled negotiations on this matter, a major agreement was approved early\nin 1999 by the US and Russian governments. It involved 163,000 tonnes of natural U30g\nfeed to be supplied over the remaining 15 years of the US-Russian HEU agreement.\nCameco, Cogema (now Areva), and Nukem signed the commercial agreement with Tenex\nof Russia, giving them \"exclusive options to purchase\" 118,000 tonnes of this (nominally\n70%), leaving the remainder \"available to Tenex\". One important stipulation was that\nstockpiles, each of some 26,000 tonnes UsOs, would be held by both Russian and US\ngovernments for ten years, to 2009. The US stockpile already existed, Russia's was built\nup over the next few years from all feed not purchased by Tenex or an associate, and\nRussia was free to sell only what exceeded this.\nThe new agreement did not change the overall supply and demand situation, but it\nremoved some major uncertainties over how the material would be released to the market.\nThe 1993 agreement significantly depressed uranium exploration activities and the\nuranium price, which took until about 2003 to recover.\nPlutonium and MOX\nDisarmament will also give rise to some 150-200 tonnes of weapons-grade plutonium\n{Pu}. Weapons-grade plutonium has over 93% of the fissile isotope, Pu-239, and can be\nused, like reactor-grade Pu, in fuel for electricity production. Options considered for it\nincluded:\n\nImmobilisation with high-level waste - treating plutonium as waste,\n\nFabrication with uranium oxide as a MOX fuel for burning in existing reactors,\n\nFabrication with thorium as a fuel for existing Russian reactors,\n\nFuelling fast-neutron reactors. |\n\nhttps://world-nuclear.org/information-library/nuclear-fuel-cycle/uranium-resources/military-warheads-as-a-source-of-nuclear-fuel Bie\n\n2113/25, 4:19 AM Military Warheads as a Source of Nuclear Fuel - World Nuclear Association\nIn 1994 the USA announced that about half of its military plutonium stockpile was surplus\nto military requirements. This included non-pit material, and about 20 tonnes of it was of\nsuch quality that it might not be possible to utilize it for MOX. In 2012 the US DOE\nplutonium inventory was announced as being 95.4 tonnes as of 2009, after some\ntransuranic wastes containing 4.8 t of plutonium had been disposed of at the Waste\nIsolation Pilot Plant (WIPP) in New Mexico. The 95.4 t was composed of 81.3 t weapons\ngrade, 12.7 t fuel grade, and 1.4 t reactor grade plutonium. Since 1944, 103.4 tonnes has\nbeen produced, and a further 8.0 t had come from industry, foreign countries and research\nreactors. Some 3.4 tonnes had been used in tests, 7.8 t discarded as waste and 2.8 t\notherwise removed. Russia’s inventory of weapons-grade plutonium is unknown, but is\nassumed to be of the same order as USA's.\nIn June 2000, the USA and Russia agreed to dispose of at least 34 tonnes each of\nweapons-grade plutonium by 2014. The USA undertook to pursue a dual track program\n{immobilisation and MOX), self-funded, while the G-7 nations were to provide some US$\n2.5 billion to set up Russia's program. The latter was initially MOX-orfented for VVER\nreactors, the high cost being because this was not part of Russia's fuel cycle policy. The\nUSA agreed to allow the Russian plutonium to be used in BN-600 and BN-800 fast\nneutron reactors, and the timeline stretched to 2018. However, the G7 funding was not\navailable on this basis and Russia is funding most of the program, with the USA\ncontributing $400 million. The 68 tonnes of weapons-grade plutonium in both countries is\nequivalent to about 12,000 tonnes of natural uranium.\nIn 2011 an amending protocol to the 2000 agreement came into force, confirming the\nRussian use of fast reactors and specifying a weapons plutonium disposition rate of 1.3\nt/yr in each country from 2018. However, after the Russian MOX plant had been built and\nthe US project stalled, Russia unilaterally cancelled the agreement in October 2016. A bill\nwas introduced to Russia's parliament, with an explanatory note saying that there were\nboth political and technical reasons to cancel the deal, even though it could be renewed\nunder certain conditions related to relaxing US sanctions. The presidential decree said the\nmain reason for cancellation is \"the emergence of a threat to strategic stability as a result\nof US hostile actions against Russia.\" |\n\nhttps:/Wworld-nuclear. org/information-library/nuclear-fuel-cycle/uranium-resources/milltary-warheads-as-a-source-of-nuclear-fuel 916\n\n2113/25, 4:19 AM Military Warheads as a Source of Nuclear Fuel - World Nuclear Association\nWeapons-grade plutonium entering the civil fuel cycle needs to be kept under very tight\nsecurity, and there are some technical measures needed to achieve this. MOX fuel made\nfrom it should degrade it so that Pu-239 cannot be extracted. As it became clear that this\ncould be achieved, the USA dropped its immobilisation plans for most military\nplutonium,* and this is reflected in the April 2010 agreement with Russia.\n\nUSA projects\n\nAfter environmental and safety reviews, the US Nuclear Regulatory Commission\nauthorized construction of a MOX fuel fabrication plant (MFFF) at the DOE Savannah River\nsite in South Carolina by Duke, Cogema, Stone & Webster. Construction started in August\n2007, by Shaw Areva MOX Services. It would make about 1700 civil MOX fuel assemblies\nfrom depleted uranium and at least 34 tonnes of weapons-grade plutonium, unlike other\nMOxX plants which use fresh reactor-grade plutonium having around one third non-fissile\nplutonium isotopes. US reactors using MOX fuel will need to licensed for it. The MFFF is\ndesigned to turn 3.5 t/yr of weapons-grade plutonium into about 150 MOX fuel\nassemblies, both PWR and BWR. The project includes a facility for plutonium pits\ndismantlement and metallic plutonium conversion to oxide which is complex and has\ndelayed progress.\n\nShaw Areva MOX Services is under contract to the National Nuclear Security\nAdministration (NNSA), which will own the plant, originally expected to be in operation\nfrom 2016, then 2019. The high cost of the plant — $3.5 billion plus $1.3 billion contingency\nand $183 million per year to operate - is justified on non-proliferation grounds. Annual cost\nwould be offset by revenue.* However, early in 2014 the project was excluded from the\nDOE budget request for NNSA due to cost escalation, so faced being shut down while\n60% complete. This would leave the USA in default on the 2000 bilateral agreement, while\nRussia has fulfilled its side.\n\n* The following is a comment on this US situation from Dr C. Wolfe, former chairman of the\nTechnical Advisory Panel to the Department of Energy's Plutonium Focus Area, whose task\nhad been to advise on technology to enable the disposition of the excess plutonium: In\ndiscussion with Russia \"the USA often emphasized elaborate technology schemes to\n\nhttps://world-nuclear.org/information-library/nuclear-fuel-cycle/uranium-resources/military-warheads-as-a-source-of-nuclear-fuel 10/16\n\n2113/25, 4:19 AM Military Warheads as a Source of Nuclear Fuel - World Nuclear Association\nimmobilize the plutonium in a proliferation-resistant state. These included grouts, synthetic\nrock, glass and co-disposal with spent nuclear fuel. The Russians were astounded. They\ncouldn't believe that we were willing to take this material, which we had spent billions of\ndollars producing, and just throw it away. Not only throw it away, but spend a lot of\nadditional money to get rid of it. The Russians saw it for what it was: a tremendous energy\nresource, The US eventually came to the same conclusion and opted for converting 34\nmetric tons of weapons-grade plutonium into MOX fuel to provide electrical energy for the\nUS economy.\" (Aiken Standard 10/8/09)\nIn June 2005 the first four fuel assemblies with mixed oxide fuel made from US military\nplutonium {plus depleted uranium) started generating electricity in Duke Power's\nCatawba-1 nuclear power plant in South Carolina, on a trial basis. They incorporated 140\nkg of weapons-grade plutonium. The plutonium was made into 2 tonnes of pellets at the\nCadrache plant and then fabricated into fuel assemblies at the Melox plant in France. This\ntrial was concluded satisfactorily.\nDOE was moving all its surplus non-pit weapons plutonium — reported to be 12.8 tonnes —\nto Savannah River by 2010. Once the material is consolidated there, the Department's\nplans for disposing of it involve the use of three Savannah River site facilities: the MOX Fuel\nFabrication Facility (MFFF, under construction) for 7.8 tonnes, the existing H-Canyon\nprocessing plant followed by a proposed new small-scale plutonium vitrification plant for\nthe balance of 5.0 tonnes. The H-Canyon facility* is the last such US plant able to treat\nused HEU fuel and similar materials still operational.\n*H-Canyon dates from 1955 and originally recovered uranium, neptunium and plutonium from used military and\nresearch reactor HEU fuel. Since 1998 it has recovered HEU from degraded materials and spent fuel, to recycle it as.\nLEU. This program will continue to 2019,\nFollowing DOE's September 2007 addition of 9 tonnes of plutonium from dismantled\nweapons to the MOX program, making 43.4 tonnes surplus to defence needs and\ndesignated for MOX, NNSA decided that the Savannah River plant might also produce\nstarter fuel for advanced fast reactors, part of the advanced fuel cycle initiative (AFCI)\nprogram. |\n\nhttps://world-nuclear.org/information-library/nuclear-fuel-cycle/uranium-resources/military-warheads-as-a-source-of-nuclear-fuel 4116\n\n2113/25, 4:19 AM Military Warheads as a Source of Nuclear Fuel - World Nuclear Association\nMeanwhile the US has developed a \"spent fuel standard\". This specifies that plutonium\nshould never be more accessible than if it were incorporated in spent fuel and thus\nprotected from interference by strong gamma radiation. The plutonium immobilisation\nplant, if and when it is eventually built, would thus incorporate the plutonium in a version\nof Synroc ( artificial rock), and encase small discs of this in canisters of vitrified high-level\nradioactive waste. Alternatively, plutonium would be mixed with fission products and\nvitrified at the small plant proposed for Savannah River.\nEurope's well-developed MOX capacity suggests that weapons plutonium could be\ndisposed of relatively quickly. Input weapons-grade plutonium might need to be mixed\nwith reactor grade material or blended with Pu-238, but using such MOX as 30% of the\nfuel in one third of the world's reactor capacity would remove about 15 tonnes of warhead\nplutonium per year. This would amount to burning 3000 warheads per year to produce\n110 billion kWh of electricity.\nAbout 40 reactors in Europe are licensed to use MOX fuel, and 30 French reactors are\nlicensed to use it as 30% of their fuel.\nRussian projects\nRussia is using its plutonium to fuel fast neutron reactors such as its BN-600 and BN-800,\nand later BREST at Beloyarsk. The USA earlier insisted that it duplicate US plans to make it\ninto MOX fuel for late-model conventional reactors, and for this Russia insisted that the\nUSA pay all costs. But after announcement of the Global Nuclear Energy Partnership in\n2006 with its proposals for use of fast reactors, US objection to Russian plans\ndisappeared. The 34 tonnes of plutonium initially available for MOX would have been\nenough for 1350 fuel assemblies for light-water reactors, but instead is going into MOX\nfuel for BN-600 and BN-800 fast reactors — the former with one-third MOX core and the\nlatter with full MOX core, and accounting for most of the usage. The USA has agreed to\ncontribute US$ 400 million towards the cost of this — much less than for the MOX option in\nVVER reactors. The BN-600 will be run without a breeding blanket and the BN-800 at\nconversion ratio of less than 1.\n\nhttps://world-nuclear.org/information-library/nuclear-fuel-cycle/uranium-resources/military-warheads-as-a-source-of-nuclear-fuel 1216\n\n2113/25, 4:19 AM Military Warheads as a Source of Nuclear Fuel - World Nuclear Association\nA small pelletized MOX fuel fabrication plant has operated at the Mayak Production\nAssociation facility at Ozersk since 1993, for BN-600 fuel (40 fuel assemblies per year),\nand it supplied some initial pelletized MOX fuel for BN-800 start-up.\nThe 60 t/yr commercial MOX Fuel Fabrication Facility (MFFF) commenced operation at\nZheleznogorsk in 2015, operated by the Mining & Chemical Combine (MCC). It represents\nthe first industrial-scale use of plutonium in the Russian civil fuel cycle. lt makes pelletized\nMOX fuel assemblies for the BN-800 and future BN-1200 fast reactors. The MOX can have\nup to 30% plutonium. The Research Institute of Atomic Reactors (RIAR or NIIAR) at\nDimitrovgrad, has a small MOX fuel fabrication plant producing vibropacked fuel which is\nmore readily recycled.\nIn collaboration with TVEL, the Siberian Chemical Combine (SCC) at Seversk is making test\nbatches of dense mixed nitride uranium-plutonium (MNUP) fuel for fast reactors,\nessentially prototype fuel for BREST fast reactors which are being developed. Burning\nSCC’s test batch MNUP fuel in the BN-600 fast reactor commenced in 2015. The BN-800\nreactor has a uranium blanket but will operate as a net plutonium consumer for the life of\nthe disposition project. Jointly the two BN reactors are expected to burn 1.5 tonnes of this\nweapons plutonium per year.\nThe USA and Russia earlier intended to continue cooperative development of a gas-cooled\nhigh-temperature reactor (GT-MHR) in Russia which was to \"create additional possibilities\nfor speeding up plutonium disposition\" from about 2015. This plan has lapsed.\nThe 2000 US-Russian agreement precludes the reprocessing of MOX fuel using military\nplutonium if the plutonium is separated out, so such reprocessing will be either to give\nplutonium plus uranium or plus actinides. Russia is said to have 40 tonnes of separated\nreactor-grade plutonium already from reprocessed fuel.\nUK plans\nIn 1998 the UK held an estimated 7.6 tonnes of military plutonium, of which 3.5 tonnes\nwas weapons-grade. A total of 4.4 tonnes was subsequently declared surplus to military\nhttps://world-nuclear.org/information-library/nuclear-fuel-cycle/uranium-resources/military-warheads-as-a-source-of-nuclear-fuel 13/16\n\n2113/25, 4:19 AM Military Warheads as a Source of Nuclear Fuel - World Nuclear Association\nneeds. (The UK also holds about 100 tonnes of reactor-grade plutonium for which uses are\nbeing evaluated.)\nThorium-plutonium fuel project\nSince the early 1990s Russia has had a program to develop a thorium-uranium fuel, which\nthen moved to have a particular emphasis on utilisation of weapons-grade plutonium in a\nthorium-plutonium fuel. The program was based at Moscow's Kurchatov Institute and\ninvolved the US company Lightbridge Corporation (formerly Thorium Power) and US\ngovernment funding to design fuel for Russian VVER-1000 reactors.\nWhereas normal fuel uses enriched uranium oxide throughout the fuel assembly, the new\ndesign has a demountable centre portion and blanket arrangement, with plutonium-\nzirconium metal fuel rods in the centre and uranium-thorium oxide pellets in conventional\nfuel rods around it*. The Th-232 in the blanket captures neutrons to become U-233, which\nis fissile - as is the core Pu-239. Blanket material remains in the reactor for nine years but\nthe centre portion is burned for only three years (as in a normal VVER). Design of the seed\nfuel rods in the centre portion draws on extensive experience of Russian navy reactors.\n* More precisely: A normal VVER-1000 fuel assembly has 331 rods each 9 mm diameter forming a hexagonal\nassembly 235 mm wide. Here, the centre portion of each assembly is 155 mm across and holds the seed material\nconsisting of metallic Pu-Zr alloy {Pu is about 10% of alloy, and isotopically over 90% Pu-239) as 108 twisted tricorn-\nsection rods 12.75 mm across with Zr-1%Nb cladding. The sub-critical blanket consists of U-Th oxide fuel pellets (9\nU:Th, the U enriched up to almost 20%) in 228 Zr-1%Nb cladding tubes 8.4 mm diameter - four layers around the\ncentre portion. The blanket material achieves 100 GWd/t burn-up. Together as one fuel assembly the seed and blanket\nhave the same geometry as a normal VVER-1000 fuel assembly.\nThe thorium-plutonium fuel claims four advantages over MOx: proliferation resistance,\ncompatibility with existing reactors — which will need minimal modification to be able to\nburn it, and the fuel can be made in existing plants in Russia. In addition, a lot more\nplutonium can be put into a single fuel assembly than with MOX, so that three times as\nmuch can be disposed of as when using MOX. The spent fuel amounts to about half the\nhttps://world-nuclear.org/information-library/nuclear-fuel-cycle/uranium-resources/military-warheads-as-a-source-of-nuclear-fuel 14/16\n\n2113/25, 4:19 AM Military Warheads as a Source of Nuclear Fuel - World Nuclear Association\nvolume of MOX and is even less likely to allow recovery of weapons-useable material than\nspent MOX fuel, since less fissile plutonium remains in it. With an estimated 150 tonnes of\nweapons Pu in Russia, the thorium-plutonium project would not necessarily cut across\nexisting plans to make MOX and mixed nitride fuel. However, the program appears to have\nlapsed.\nSee also information papers: Plutonium, Mixed Oxide Fuel, Fuel Fabrication and Synroc.\nNotes & references\nIvanov, 2000, paper in Proceedings of 25th Ul Symposium.\nNATO ASI series, 1994, Managing the Plutonium Surplus: Applications and Technical\nOptions.\nUnderhill, D H, 1998, paper to U'98 Conference, Adelaide.\nNNSA, US-Russia Partnership Reaches Key Milestone in Converting Russian Nuclear\nWeapons into US Nuclear Fuel, 24 June 2013.\nThorium Power 2003, Weapons-grade Plutonium Burning Fuel for Russian VVER-1000\nNuclear Power Plants.\nMorozov et al, Thorium fuel as a superior approach to disposing of excess weapons-grade\nplutonium in Russian VVER-1000 reactors, Nuclear Future, Vol 1 No. 1 (2005)\nOUR ASSOCIATION ADDRESS GENERAL ENQUIRIES MEMBERSHIP ENQUIRIES MEDIA ENQUIRIES [\nhttps://world-nuclear.org/information-library/nuclear-fuel-cycle/uranium-resources/military-warheads-as-a-source-of-nuclear-fuel 15/16\n\n2113/25, 4:19 AM Mllitary Warheads as a Source of Nuclear Fuel - World Nuclear Association\n\nOur Mission York House, t +44 (0}20 7451 1520 Member support Henry Preston CONNECT WITH US\n\nLeadership 23 Kingsway, f: +44 (0}20 7839 1501 members@world-nuclear.org +44 (0)20 7451 1523\n\nour Merb London, €: info@world-nuclearorg e: press@world-nucteararg\n\nur Members WC2B 6UJ, Joining enquiries\n\nVacancies United Kingdom enrolment@world-nuclear.org\n\nContact Us\n\nPRIVACY NOTICE COOKIES POLICY REUSE OF WORLD NUCLEAR ASSOCIATION CONTENT\n\n© 2016-2026 World Nuclear Association, registered in England and Wales, number 01215741.\nhttps://world-nuclear.org/information-library/nuclear-fuel-cycle/uranium-resources/military-warheads-as-a-source-of- nuclear-fuel 16/16\n\n",
