We show how the approval of the Plan in July 1979, with a significant\nreduction in the nuclear energy component, was influenced by the anti-nuclear protest movements in Spain.\nDespite the efforts of the Spanish Atomic Forum to counter its message, the anti-nuclear movement was\nstrengthened by reactions to the Three Miles Island accident in March 1979.\n\nKeywords: Nuclear industry, anti-nuclear movement, Spanish Atomic Forum, Franco regime, Spain.\nIntroduction\n\nThe atomic debate erupted into the public sphere of Western countries during the 1960s and 1970s with\nconfrontations between anti-nuclear activists and pro-nuclear associations. Waves of anti-nuclear protest\nspread rapidly in countries that had invested heavily in nuclear programs to meet the energy crisis in 1973.\nPublic perception of nuclear power was becoming increasingly negative, and the term nuclear evoked\nwidespread fears about accidents, radioactivity or bombs. In this context, the future of nuclear was highly\ndependent on public and political acceptance. Pro-nuclear coalitions were mainly composed of nuclear\nscientists and engineering firms, electric utilities, nuclear plant manufacturers, and agencies promoting\nnuclear power, i.e., the so-called “Atomic Industrial Establishment” (Lewis 1972). During the 1950s,\nIndustrial Nuclear Forums were founded by pro-nuclear lobbies in countries utilizing or developing nuclear\npower, Their aim was to communicate favorable information on specific projects and on nuclear power in\ngeneral in order to enhance the credibility of the nuclear industry and improve its public acceptance.\n\nThe main goal of this study was to analyze the role played by the nuclear industry in Spain during\nthe 1960s and 1970s in the context of a growing antinuclear movement and increasing concerns among the\ngeneral population. There is a wide historiography on the introduction and development of nuclear energy in\nSpain, but it has mainly addressed political, military, or technological issues (Presas i Puig 2005, Romero\nand Sénchez-Ron 2001; Orddfiez and Sanchez-Ron 1996). Research has also focused on anti-nuclear activity\nin Spain during the final years of Franco regime (Costa 1976; Fernandez 1999; Lopez Romo 2008; Lopez\nRomo and Lanero Taboas 2010). However, little attention has been paid so far to the role of the industry\nitself in the development of nuclear power in Spain or to the actions taken to counteract the rising anti-\n\n2\n\nnuclear movement in the 1960s and 1970s.\n\nIn a first attempt to fill this historiographical gap, we focused on the Forum Atdmico Espaiiol\n(Spanish Atomic Forum, hereafter FAE), the industrial association that promoted the interests of the nuclear\nsector in Spain. We sought to identify and clarify the main arguments of the nuclear sector in the Spanish\npublic arena by analyzing the abundant material published by the FAE during the period from 1962 through\n1979, starting with the setting up of the FAE and ending after the Three Miles Island (hereafter TMT)\naccident. We shall also discuss the relevance of the accident in Harrisburg as a significant turing point in\nSpanish public opinion on the nuclear industry.\n\nWe focus on the last years of this period, 1977 to 1979, which coincided with the discussion of a new\nNational Energy Plan (hereafter NEP) in Congress, with some important local protests, and with the TMI\naccident. We completed our study of trends in Spanish public opinion by analyzing pro-nuclear and anti-\nnuclear discourses in two leading newspapers of the time, ABC and E/ Pais, and in two of the most important\nregional newspapers, La Gaceta del Norte and El Periédico de Catalunya.\n\nAnti-nuclear movements in the decades of protest\n\nThe 1960s were marked by public discontent organized in different types of protest movement, including the\nanti-nuclear wing of the environmentalist movement, the feminist movement, and the peace movement, with\na varying degree of interactions among them (Kriesi et al. 1995: 8; Giugni 2004: 44-45). However, although\nthe 1960s have usually been perceived as the decade of protest, it was the 1970s in which a wide variety of\nsocial movements entered the public arena (Freeman and Johnson 1999: 5), They maintained most of the\nstructural goals underlying their creation during the 1960s, but their concems and strategies changed in\naccordance with the new times.\n\nThe anti-nuclear movement provides a good illustration of this development. Nuclear power has\nalways been controversial, and the distrust of the population and their gradual resistance were already\nmanifest by the mid-1950s, mainly in protests by peace and nuclear disarmament movements against the\nhazards of nuclear weapons testing and their effects on the environment and neighboring populations (Taylor,\n1994). Nevertheless, public awareness of nuclear risks was not widespread until the expansion of nuclear\npower programs during the 1960s, when many more communities were affected by siting proposals (Surrey\nand Hugget 1976; Rudig 1990).\n\nThe construction of nuclear power plants was promoted with particular intensity by governments\nduring the 1973 energy crisis to reduce their dependence on oil and supposedly provide a cheap source of\nelectricity. This development was led by the USA nuclear industry. In early 1973, the American Energy\nCommission (hereafter AEC) predicted a huge increase in nuclear capacity, with industry executives talking\nof “a net inerease in utility commitment to nuclear power” and “the virtual collapse of competition from\nfossil fuels” (Walker 2006: 7-8). Several citizens’ groups emerged to confront the expansion of the nuclear\nindustry, and the 1970s saw a shift in the anti-nuclear movement toward protests against the development of\n\n3\n\nnuclear power as a source of energy. The nuclear power conflict became described as one of the most intense\ncontroversies in the history of technology (Kitschelt 1986: 57).\n\nAnti-nuclear movements pursued distinct strategies and had a different impact on overall energy\npolicy in each national case, depending on the political opportunity structure of the country in question\n(Kitschelt 1986: 57-85; Shawki 2010: 383-385).! However, they all shared a number of common features that\nshaped the anti-nuclear struggle: a previous protest movement against nuclear weapons testing and against\ntadioactive pollution; a rapid rise in environmental concerns during the 1960s; a movement towards greater\nsocial responsibility in science; and new cultural and political values opposed to the economic system and\nenergy growth.” Most of these concems were also important to environmentalist and pacifist movements, but\nthe anti-nuclear movement was distinguished by its focus on the specific risks of nuclear power, including\nthe large-scale effects of a potential accident, the possibility of long-term mortality from cancer, the potential\ngenetic effects on future generations, and the association between nuclear power and nuclear weapons\n(Surrey and Hugget 1976: 286-288; Rudig 1990).\n\nThe opposition to nuclear power was greater than expected, especially in Europe. In France, the first\ntwo decades of nuclear development took place in an atmosphere of political consensus, free from any public\nopposition until the early 1970s, Nevertheless, there were strong anti-nuclear protests against new siting\nproposals, especially in Fessenheim (1971) and Marckolsheim (1974) on the German border. A wave of\nprotest rapidly spread to Germany and Switzerland, helped by the political opportunities presented in both\ncountries through mass mobilizations for regional claims (Kriesi et al. 1995: 181).\n\nAnti-nuclear protests were connected across Europe, with the different movements imitating\n\nsuccessful tactics employed in other countries (Kriesi et al. 1995; Taylor, 1994; Rudig 1990; Falk 1982; Mills\nand Williams 1986). They argued for a slowing in the growth of energy consumption and for the\ndevelopment of other energy sources, emphasizing the need for safeguards in relation to the transport,\nreprocessing, and disposal of radioactive materials (Surrey and Huggett 1976: 297-298; Rudig 1990: 112-\n130). Major demonstrations against government nuclear plans took place in different countries during the\n1970s. The successful “Whyl experience” in Germany’ encouraged other mobilizations throughout Europe,\n‘Political opportunity structures are comprised of specific configurations of resources, institutional arrangements, and historical\nprecedents for social mobilization, which facilitate the development of protest movements in some instances and constrain them in\nothers.” (Kitschelt 1986: 58),\n2 While we can find some similarities between the protests in Europe and the USA, Japan represents a particular case, The bombs in\nHiroshima and Nagasaki, the severe seismic conditions and the Bikini incident produced a complex and conflictive scenario around.\nnuclear energy in Japan. The anti-nuclear opposition in Japan has been widely discussed by several authors, who have described the\ndifferent facets of the Japanese anti-nuclear movement. For instance, Akaha (1985: 75-89) reports the influence of the anti-nuclear\nmovement in the parliamentary resolution that has guided Japancse nuclear policy since the late 1960s, known as the “thrce\nnonnuclear principles”; while Higuchi emphasizes the environmentalist origins of the Japanese anti-nuclear movements against the\ncentrality of Hiroshima and Nagasaki within this activism (Higuchi 2008). Nevertheless, there is a wide consensus about the major\nimportance of the movement against nuclear tests in the mid-1950s, and more than one-third of the Japan population had signed a\npetition to ban muclear tests by the summer of 1955 (Yamazaki 2009: 132-145).\n\nPolitical, economic and labor representatives worked together to rebuild the national industry complex, and they agreed in the\ncreation of a new electric utility (Electricité de France) and the atomic energy commission, strongly supported by De Gaulle (Hetch\n1996: 486-488).\n\n* Wyttl, a small village in the southwestern comer of Germany, was proposed in 1971 as a possible site for a nuclear power station. In\n\nthe years that followed, the incipient local opposition had little impact on politicians and planners. Official permission for the plant\n\nwas granted and earthworks began on February 17 1975 (Patterson 1986: 113). Just the day after, local people spontaneously\n4\n\nincluding strong protests in Austria, Switzerland, France, aud Spain (Mills and Williams 1986: 375-376),\n\nAmong the numerous local anti-nuclear protests in the USA during the 1970s, some captured public\nattention at a national level, including activities by the Clamshell Alliance protests at Seabrook Station\nNuclear Power Plant and by the Abalone Alliance at Diablo Canyon Nuclear Power Plant. After the 1979\nTMI accident, protests spreads around the country, and 65,000 people joined a large demonstration against\nnuclear power in Washington D.C. in May 1979 (Giugni 2004: 44-45).\n\nThe backlash: Reaction of the industrial lobbies\n\nDuring the post-war years and the Cold War, the positive perception and acceptance of nuclear power was\ninfluenced by propaganda techniques and communication campaigns targeting public opinion. The best\nexample was the Atoms for Peace program developed by the Eisenhower administration (Krige 2006; Weart\n1988; Hewlett and Holl 1989; Forgan 2003).\n\nWhen the civil atomic programs started in the 1950s, they were led by different governmental\nnuclear agencies and involved both private and public investment (Hewlett 1990). The US Atomic Industrial\nForum (hereafter AIF) was created in 1954 and represented more than 400 companies and private\ncorporations in the nuclear field by 1956. In the United Kingdom, the British Nuclear Energy Society and the\nInstitution of Nuclear Engineers began to serve the industry and represent its interests in 1956, a few years\nafter the British nuclear industry first came into being (British Nuclear Energy Society 1956). During the late\n1950s, following the creation of the AIF, several industrial associations were established in Europe, such as\nthe Deutsches Atomforum in Germany; the Forum Atomique Francais in France and the Forum Italiano\nDell’Energia Nucleare in Italy. The European Atomic Forum, Foratom, the Brussels-based trade association\nfor the nuclear energy industry in Europe, was founded in 1959 (Caro et al. 1995; 398).\n\nAfter the first substantial opposition to a planned reactor in the 1950s in the USA (Goodman 1961),\nleaders of the industry started to become worried about a hazard that was new for them.’ By 1969, the AIF's\nPublic Affairs and Information Committee was alarmed about the rising anti-nuclear movements and about\nthe growing national press coverage of the issue.® During the early 1970s, even some of the most aggressive\npromoters of nuclear energy at the political level took serious note of the environmental concerns and anti-\nnuclear opposition. Several states proposed more restrictive environmental legislation for nuclear sites\noccupied the site and the police used force to remove them two days later, on February 20, Television coverage of the rough\ntreatment of the local farmers by the police contributed to tum nuclear power into a major national issue (Fach and Grande 1992: 20).\nSubsequent support came ftom the university town of Freiburg, when about 30,000 people re-occupied the Wyhl site on February 23.\n‘The Wyhl occupation and the subsequent demonstration in Freiburg gencrated extensive debate in Germany and, on March 21 1975\nan administrative court withdrew the construction license for the plant (Rudig 1990; 130-135; Mills and Williams 1986: 375-376,\nGottlieb 2005: 237). The plant was never built and the land eventually became a nature reserve. The importance of the Wyhl\nexperience in encouraging the emergence of local and regional grassroots activism has been highlighted (Mills and Williams 1986:\n375-376, Rudig 1990). The growing protest after the Whyl conflict has been described as a prelude to the “sudden death” of the\nnuclear program in the late 1970s (Fach and Grande 1992: 20-21). Anti-nuclear success at Wyhl also inspired nuclear opposition in\nthe rest of Europe and North America (Patterson 1986: 113; Gottlieb 2005: 237; Rudig 1990: 130-135).\n\n5 ‘The members of the AIF and the insurance companies pointed out that the risks associated with fuel production, reprocessing\nand waste storage were as great in the long term as those associated with the reactors. See Damian (1992: 606).\n° The Chair of this Committee cited the article “The nukes are in hot water”, published in 1969 by Sports Hustrated, as the first\nindication of this change (Balogh 1991: 264),\n\n5\n\n(Balogh 1991: 265-285). Consequently, the AIF and the energy-utility complex focused their efforts on the\ndelegitimization of the anti-nuclear movement rather than on a public debate about nuclear hazards.’\n\nThe best example of this public struggle was “Proposition 15°” in the California election in June\n1976, The Proposition called for stricter legislative regulation of the nuclear power industry, and inspired six\nsimilar ballots in other states and in Switzerland. Representatives of the industry feared that success of the\nProposition would have an anti-nuclear domino effect (Wellock 1998: 149), The nuclear industry in the USA,\nled by the ATF, made available a large number of documents arguing the pro-nuclear case. They mainly\nhighlighted the possible economic effects of a nuclear moratorium, the environmental problems of coal\nmining, and the illegality of the Proposition (Kenward 1976). Notwithstanding the eventual rejection of the\nProposition, it was perceived by the nuclear industry as a bittersweet victory because it had contributed to a\ngaining of momentum and influential support for the anti-nuclear movement (Wellock 1998: 332).\n\nBy the early 1970s, the electric companies were finding it increasingly difficult to obtain project\nlicenses, and several projects in Europe and Japan had been withdrawn by 1972 due to local opposition\n(Young 1983: 1-16). Support for nuclear power was led by the national industrial associations, which\nlaunched various communication campaigns highlighting the need for nuclear power in the context of an\nenergy crisis. These campaigns detailed the high safety standards in nuclear industry and promoted\nconsultation processes and public discussions with representatives of local communities, unions, and other\ncivil associations affected by siting proposals (European Nuclear Society 1979; Surrey and Hugget 1976:\n299-300; Hetch 1996: 488-489; Yamazaki 2009: 137-138.). In Spain, they also played on fears of becoming\nover-dependent upon oil and emphasized the presence of uranium reserves in the country (Sanchez-Vazquez\n2012: 77-78).\n\nBy the late 1970s, every country with a commercial nuclear program had experienced its own anti-\nnuclear reaction with specific national characteristics. Advocates of nuclear energy were surprised by the\nintense public opposition to the large scale application of this energy source, However, the experience drawn\nfrom public hearings, debates, and face-to-face discussions with representatives of the anti-nuclear\nmovements made them aware “of modes of thought and criteria of judgment that they had not previously\nencountered” (Hafele 1974: 303).\n\nThe nuclear industry in Spain (1962-1976)\n\nThe importance of the military nature of Franco regime in shaping the early Spanish interest in nuclear\ntechnology (Presas i Puig 2005; Orddfiez and SAnchez-Ron 1996) was consolidated by the discovery and\nexploitation of uranium deposits in Spain in the early 1950s.* Eisenhower's Atoms for Peace Program’ and\n7 As it was put by Frank Shants, special project manager of the New Hampshire Public Service Company “Instead of trying to arouse\nthe public for nuclear power, we should change course and try to arouse the public against the antinuclear groups ...” (Davidon 1979:\ne Shain began its own production of uranium on an industrial scale, becoming the third country in Europe, after United Kingdom and\nFrance, with a pilot chemical treatment plant (Caro et al. 1995: 50-56).\n\n° The Spanish case shows the propaganda facet of the Atoms for Peace programme to perfection (Weart, 1988: 162-165). On July\n1955, USA and Spain signed an agreement in Washington D.C, for cooperation “conceming civil uses of atomic energy”, The\n\n6\n\nthe First International Conference on the Peaceful Uses of Atomic Energy have been acknowledged as\nrelevant factors encouraging the Spanish government to develop a Spanish nuclear power industry.'° The\nopening of the Spanish market to private American companies involved in the construction of power reactors\nwas effectively promoted in this context.\n\nTn the 1960s, there was a change in Spanish economic and social situation and an opening up to the\noutside world, Agreement was reached between the main Spanish political force, the falangists (nationalists),\nand the new technocrats on the need to encourage the development of nuclear energy. This agreement\nallowed “one of the poorest countries in Western Europe to enter the exclusive club of nuclear producing\ncountries” (De la Torre and Rubio 2014: 2). However, while the falangists supported nuclear energy as a\nmeans of strengthening Spanish autonomy, the technocrats saw it as the best means to liberalize the national\neconomy and promote the involvement of private companies in nuclear power production. The nationalist\nline was backed by the National Institute of Industry (Instituto Nacional de Industria, INI) headed by Juan\nAntonio Suanzes, The INI diverged from the official policies on nuclear power presented by the Nuclear\nEnergy Board (Junta de Energia Nuclear, JEN), the governmental agency responsible for all aspects of\nnuclear management until the 1960s, when private industry started to gain importance in Spanish nuclear\ndevelopment (Romero and Sanchez-Ron 2001: 123-150; Gomez Mendoza 2007: 551-553; Sanchez-Vazquez\n2012: 68-70).\n\nThese conflicts and divergences within the Spanish Government during the late 1950s are crucial for\nan understanding of this process. Faced with the obstructionist attitude of the INI, the JEN and the private\ncompanies adopted a policy of active cooperation at the experimental and technological level, supporting the\nproposals of the technocrats (Gémez Mendoza 2007: 551).\n\nHence, the technoeratic argument prevailed over the nationalist view, because the gradual\ninternational integration of the country made it easier for the Spanish industry to acquire foreign technology\nand buy nuclear reactors “keys-in-hand” (Presas i Puig 2005: 210-214; Romero and Sanchez-Ron 2001: 195-\n201), although some major figures in the regime complained about Spain's self-imposed dependence on\nforeigners and its inappropriate industrial strategy (Presas i Puig, 2005: 214-215). This change in the attitude\nof the government can also be interpreted in the context of a new phase in global nuclear development,\nwhich demanded a new organization system focused on commercial reactors, as reported in other national\ncases’, In so doing, the leadership of the Spanish nuclear sector started to be transferred from the\ngovernmental Nuclear Energy Board to private industry (Presas i Puig 2009; Sanchez-Vazquez 2010: 85-90),\nagreement made it clear that the USA effectively controlled nuclear matters in Spain through the AEC. It also pointed out that\n“private organizations in either the USA or Spain may deal directly with private individuals and private organizations in the other\ncountry (Ordofiez and Sanchez-Ron 1996: 195-196).\n\n19 ‘The favorable climate of opinion in the Conference, as well as the estimations for the consumption of electricity in the sixties,\npointed clearly to nuclear power as a solution, even when its economic viability remained controversial. (Weart 1988: 158; Barca\nSalom 2005: 163-181).\n\n‘This model was based on linking together certain economic sectors, including infrastructure construction, electrical and\nmetallurgical materials, and financing [banks, insurance]. It also reinforced commercial relationships with the United States (and to a\nlesser extent with Germany and France), which strengthened the military and geo-strategic position of Spain in the Western world\n(Romero and Saénchez-Ron 2001; 201; De la Torre and Rubio 2013: 2-3).\n\n7\n\ncontributing to create what has been called the Spanish version of the “Nuclear Iron Triangle”\"?, which\nbrought together politicians from the government, technicians and scientists from the Nuclear Energy Board,\nand representatives from private companies (De la Torre and Rubio 2014: 16).\n\nThe Spanish nuclear industry “boom” began in 1963, when a newly founded company, Nuclenor,\nwas licensed to build a nuclear power station in Santa Maria de Garofia, Burgos. The reactor was purchased\n“keys-in-hand” from General Electric. Simultaneously, the company Cenusa applied for permission to build\na new power plant in Zorita, Guadalajara, which, in 1968, became the first to be successfully completed and\noperative in Spain. The reactor was purchased from Westinghouse (Romero de Pablos, 2012: 49-54; Caro et\nal. 1996: 355-360), In 1972, the newly founded nuclear company Hifrensa”’ constructed the Vandellés I plant\n(Tarragona) using French technology based on natural uranium. In 1971 and 1972, six new 930 MW reactors\nwere purchased from Westinghouse: Almaraz I and 1; Lemoniz I and II, which were never completed; and\nAsc6 T and II (Romero de Pablos, 2012: 55-58; Romero and Sdnchez-Ron 2001: 254-260).\n\nThe energy crisis of 1973 brought a review of energy requirements and gave renewed impetus to the\ndemand for nuclear power, as reflected in the first NEP of 1975. Eleven more stations were planned between\n1973 and 1976, but only four were finally completed (Sanchez-Vazquez 2010: 282-286). While there was\nlittle participation by Spanish industry in the first three power plants (Burgos, Guadalajara, and Tarragona),\nthis situation changed with the new power plants built in the 1970s, when up to 80% of projects were in the\nhands of private Spanish companies (Presas i Puig 2005: 217).\n\n2 Expression used by Brian Balogh for the Nuclear Program in the United States (Balogh, 1991).\n3 Hispano Francesa de Energia Nuclear, formed by three electrical companies from Catalonia (Fecsa, Enher and Hidroeléctrica de\nCataluiia) and Electricité de France (EDF) (Anes et al 2001:47).\n\n8\n\nlege op ot me or\nSGioe pp RPCODOLN, ooops nol ShimUANAYEEMONE PUNTS ENDAISS ws\nUg teigeer es Oo.

The 50 founding companies included the main electric companies in Spain (i.e., Hidroeléctrica\nEspafiola, Iberduero, Electra de Viesgo, Endesa, Hidroeléctrica del Cantabrico, Union Eléctrica Madrilefia,\nCompaiifa Sevillana de Electricidad, and Hidroeléctrica de Catalufia), new companies established to manage\nSpanish nuclear facilities (.e., Cenusa and Nuclenor), manufacturers of nuclear components and systems\n(i.e., Construcciones Nucleares and Sociedad Espafiola de Construcciones Babcock y Wilcox), private\nengineering companies (i.e., Tecnatom and Estudios y Proyectos Eléctricos)}, the Spanish Nuclear Energy\nBoard, insurance companies (i.e. Unién Tberoamericana and La Estrella), and a bank (Banco de Vizeaya)\n(Férum Atémico Espafiol 1962: 18-20).\n\nApart from acting as the voice of the industry in energy policy discussions and promoting the\ncommercial uses of nuclear energy, FAE’s specific objectives and emphases changed over time to meet the\nneeds of the sector. During the 1960s, FAE’s major concerns were the promotion of commercial nuclear\npower, the development of different technical aspects, and integration within Foratom, aimed at gaining\ninfluence in the European setting. To meet this last objective, the FAE set up several study groups to support\nthe work of Foratom in specific tasks. During the celebration of the First Nuclear Conference organized by\nthe FAE and held in Madrid in 1963, the Foratom Executive Committee held its first meeting in Spain to\ndiscuss the role of FAE in the organization. The president of the FAE, José Maria Oriol, was named vice-\n\n9\n\npresident of Foratom in 1964 and became president of the organization in 1966, strengthening the influence\nof the FAE in the European nuclear field during the late 1960s (Caro et al. 1996: 398-399).\n\nIn this context of euphoria for the Spanish nuclear sector, changes in Spanish socio-political situation\nbrought the public relations aspect into prominence during the early 1970s (Romero and Sdnchez-Ron 2001:\n260; Sanchez-Vazquez 2010: 85-90).\n\nThe late anti-nuclear awakening in Spain: From Palomares (1966) to the “Long Anti-nuclear March”\n(1974-1977)\n\nDuring the 1960s, social opposition to nuclear energy was almost an irrelevant issue in Franco’s Spain,\nattributable to the prohibition by the powerful repressive system of any expression of opposition or\nquestioning of the regime’s policies (Ys4s 2007: 32). FAE’s activities during this decade showed a\nremarkable lack of concern about public opinion in comparison to the European or American cases. This\nposition did not even change after the so-called “Palomares incident” in 1966, one of the most high-profile\naccidents involving American nuclear weapons outside the USA. On January 17 1966, a USAF B-52G\nbomber collided with a KC-135 tanker during mid-air refueling off the coast of Spain. Out of the four Mk28\ntype hydrogen bombs lost by the bomber, three were found on land near the small fishing village of\nPalomares in Almeria, Southern Spain. The non-nuclear explosives in two of the bombs detonated upon\nimpact, contaminating an area of two square kilometers with radioactive plutonium. The fourth bomb, which\nfell into the Mediterranean Sea, was recovered intact after a 12-week search (Megara 2006; Ordditez and\nSanchez-Ron 1996; 212).\n\nSpanish government applied its usual propaganda methods to defuse possible social alarm about\nenvironmental pollution. Spanish Official Newsreel NO-DO, which was the main source of visual\ninformation for Spaniards up to the late 1960s, covered a swim by the Minister of Tourism Fraga Iribarne\nand the US ambassador Angier Biddle Duke at Palomares beach in March 1966, which became an enduring\nimage of nuclear power in Franco’s Spain. Nevertheless, the incident became the starting point for structured\nand visible opposition to nuclear energy in Spain (SAnchez-Vazquez 2010: 218-229).\n\nThere is a surprising lack of references to the incident in FAE publications. Up to this point, almost\nall references in FAE publications about anti-nuclear demonstrations or public opinion came from abroad,\"\nThis could be attributed to the immaturity and lack of developed structure of the anti-nuclear movement in\nSpain and to the government support for the sector, but it may also reflect a conscious strategy of the nuclear\nlobby to invisibilize the movement.\n\nHowever, in response to the considerable number of new nuclear power plants planned in the first\nNEP in 1975, a strong anti-nuclear movement emerged in the 1970s in Spain, which ultimately prevented the\ncompletion of most of the projects. All of the local and regional demonstrations against the new planned\nstations became known as the Long Anti-Nuclear March (Larga marcha antinuclear) (Fernandez 1999: 119-\n4 Tn the Boletines Informativos of 1966, periodicals edited by the FAE during that year, there is a total lack of references to the\nincident (Férum Atémico Espafiol, 1966a to 1966e).\n\n10\n\n129). The first protest actions began in 1974 in the Basque Country and Navarra against projects in Ea-\nIspaster, Deba, and Tudela (Lépez Romo and Lanero Taboas 2010; Lépez Romo, 2008). Several heated\ndemonstrations took place in the affected regions during 1975, and power plant projects in Sdstago and\nEscatron (Aragén); Xove (Galicia); Tarifa and Dofiana (Andalusia), and Aguilas (Murcia) were withdrawn\n(Costa 1976: 50-75).\n\nGiven the political situation in Spain during the 1970s, it would not be accurate to refer to a\nhomogeneous “Spanish” anti-nuclear movement. The anti-nuclear protests were closely linked to nationalist\nand pro-independence movements in regions like Catalonia, the Basque Country or Galicia, which\ninfluenced the shaping and development of these protests (Mora Ticé 2012; Lopez Romo and Lanero Taboas\n2010; Lopez Romo, 2008). In fact, the proliferation of discourses and collective actions of opposition to\nnuclear power plants became a valuable tool for nationalist movements to expand their presence in the public\narena in terms of the political opportunities presented by mass mobilizations. In other Spanish regions, the\narguments against nuclear power were posed in non-nationalist terms, and the protests contributed to\nstrengthening the associative movement and the demands for democracy (Lopez Romo and Lanero Taboas\n2010: 751-752).\n\nIn order to coordinate and draw together these regional mobilizations, a national organization was\ncreated in Soria in May 1977: the Anti-nuclear State Coordinator (Coordinadora Estatal Antinuclear,\nhereafter CEA). It was driven by such organizations as the Anti-Nuclear Committee of Catalonia (Comité\nAntinuclear de Catalufia), or the Defense Committee for a Non-Nuclear Basque Coast (Comisién de Defensa\nde una Costa Vasca No Nuclear), CEA did not have a stable structure or a fixed membership for\norganizations, which were able to join and leave freely. It usually met three times a year, with periods of\nhigher and lower frequency (Cabal 1996, Bigas 1991: 91-99). The structural demands of the anti-nuclear\nprotest included the call for democracy, in common with other Spanish social movements of the time. During\nthis period, from Franco’s death in 1975 to the first democratic elections in 1977, civil society in Spain\nexperienced a turbulent and exciting time and anti-nuclear movements reached their peak (Preston 1986: 60-\n72; Ysas 2007).\n\nFAE’s publications included several statements by representatives of the industry and nuclear\ninstitutions that expressed confidence in government support but also evidenced some disquiet about the\noutbreaks of unexpected opposition. This increasing anxiety is reflected in the topics chosen for FAE\nconferences and lectures. By 1977, the Spanish nuclear sector was fully aware of the problems related to the\nanti-nuclear movement.’* The Annual Nuclear Symposium organized by the FAE that year included a session\ndevoted to “Nuclear Energy and Public Opinion”, in which Spanish nuclear industry representatives\ndescribed their increasing concerns about the public reaction (Férum Atomico Espajfiol, 1977c).\n\nLeméniz conflict, the drafting of the second National Energy Plan and the reaction of the Spanish\n15 As reflected in periodicals published during 1976 and 1977, which started to express the increasing worries of the sector (Forum\nAtémico Espafiol, 1976, 1977a, 1977b).\n\n11\n\nAtomic Forum (1978)\n\nTwo major anti-nuclear events took place in Spain in 1978: conflict around the Leméniz Nuclear Power Plant\nin the Basque province of Vizcaya and mobilizations in advance of the approval of the second NEP in July\n1979, The building of the power station in Lemdéniz was opposed by ETA, the paramilitary Basque\nindependence organization, as well as by the anti-nuclear organization the Defense Committee for a Non-\nNuclear Basque Coast and several anti-nuclear local committees created in different towns (Lopez Romo\n2008: 13). They pointed to the lack of an operating license by /berduero (the company in charge) and\nhighlighted the hazards of nuclear waste (La Gaceta del Norte 1976a; Lopez Romo 2011). In August 1976, a\nmassive demonstration against the power plant took place near Plentzia and Gérliz, two small towns near\nLemoniz'®, On December 18 1977, an ETA commando unit attacked a Guardia Civil post guarding the\nstation, and one of the unit, was injured in the attack and died a month later. On March 17 1978, ETA planted.\na bomb in the reactor of the station, leaving two workers dead and more than a dozen injured (Lopez Romo\n2008; La Gaceta del Norte 19782). The explosion also caused substantial material damage to the facility'’,\nforcing Iberduero to delay its construction (Mez et al. 2009: 371; Lopez Romo 2011). The outbreak of\nviolence and the deaths prompted considerable condemnation in the regional press (La Gaceta del Norte\n1978b) and provoked intense debate within the Basque anti-nuclear movement (Lépez Romo 2008: 16).\n\nIt was under these conflictive circumstances that the discussion on the second NEP took place,\nbringing the nuclear issue to the forefront of public debate. The second NEP resulted from political\nagreements reached during the so-called Pactos de la Moncloa (Moncloa Pacts) in 1977, which involved all\ndemocratic political forces in Spain committed to a stable transition to a democratic system (Cuerdo 1999:\n165). The first draft of the second NEP proposed a significant increase of 37.7% over the nuclear power\nsupply proposed in the first NEP (Ministerio de Industria y Energia 1978), The anti-nuclear movement\nreacted to this nuclearization proposal with intense demonstrations, and demands for a moratorium were\nincluded in the political programs of the Socialist (PSOE) and Communist (PCE) Spanish parties. These\npolitical pressures forced the Ministry of Industry to draw up an alternative NEP. The media were paying\nincreasing attention to the arguments around energy policy, and the energy sector and the FAE contracted\npublic relations agencies in order to strengthen its position in the public debate (El Pais 1978a).\n\nThe redrafting of NEP was highly controversial, even within the Spanish government. It caused an\nopen confrontation between the Ministries of Industry and Economy. The Minister of Industry and his team\nwere radically opposed to Minister of Economy’s proposal for the nationalization of all nuclear plants built\nafter 1987 (El Pais 1978b). Based on new projections for future energy demand and the availability of local\nresources (coal and hydraulic power), the second draft of the NEP included a reduction of the nuclear energy\nprogram contemplated in the first draft, authorizing the construction of only three new plants in addition to\nthe seven already under construction. This implied the withdrawal of authorization for six plants awaiting\n‘6 The attendance figures vary according to different sources, but the response was massive; between 15,000 and 50,000 people (La\nGaceta del Norte 1976b; Lopez Romo and Lanero Taboas 2010: 760).\nrey damage was assessed at several hundred million pesetas according to sources close to Iberduero (La Gaceta del Norte\n\n12\n\napproval at that time. The Minister of Industry supported this reduction by arguing that the earlier nuclear\nplans had been based on an accumulated annual economic growth of around 6% that had been reduced to\n4%. The new draft was the cause of bitter controversy between the Ministry and the private sectors involved\nin the nuclear program (E] Pais 1978c).\n\nThe daily press also reflected the rising anti-nuclear environment. In May 1978, the newborn center-\nleft newspaper £7 Pais published an editorial entitled “Promises and dangers of nuclear energy” (El Pais\n1978d). It criticized the huge investment planned for the construction of nuclear power plants (estimated at\naround 325,000 million pesetas). It criticized the government’s commitment to nuclear energy as a means of\nlimiting the dependence on oil, claiming that it ignored the potential hazards of environmental pollution or\ncatastrophic accident.\n\nA month later, the sociologist Mario Gaviria, one of the leaders of environmental activism in Spain,\ndescribed “planning errors committed by the main electric companies between 1969 and 1972, when they\ndecided on the nuclearization of Spain” (El Pais 1978e). According to Gaviria, the NEPs were ideological\ndocuments used to correct successive forecast errors by the electricity sector and to support investment by\nprivate companies in nuclear power plants. He also suggested that the underlying objective of the Plan,\nadvocated by the Americans and supported by the Spanish electric and nuclear sector, was to replace oil with\nnuclear energy (El Pais 1978e).\n\nThe FAE emerged as the public representative of the nuclear sector in response to this negative\nenvironment for nuclear energy in Spain. The FAE made strong efforts to counteract the opposition through\npublic interventions in the print media, radio and TV. Alfonso Alvarez Miranda, the president of the FAB, led\nthese appearances in the media during the first half of 1978, with forthright statements that “saying no to\nnuclear energy, is saying yes to the recession and unemployment” and that “causes of opposition to nuclear\npower have no serious scientific basis but underlying emotional causes, as the memories of the atomic bombs\ndropped on Hiroshima and Nagasaki” (ABC 1978a). He also described the opposition to nuclear energy as\nmore ideological than technical, and insisted that nuclear energy was necessary, safe and affordable (ABC\n1978b). Hence, the nuclear sector strategy focused on the need for nuclear energy for economic development\nand attempted to delegitimize the opposition as “less technical” and prone to unfounded fears associated with\nthe memories of Hiroshima and nuclear bombs tests. These arguments were similar to those propagated by\nother nuclear lobbies during the 1970s.\n\nBesides the FAE, the nuclear option was strongly supported in this debate by other representatives of\nthe private energy sector, such as the managers of oil and electric companies, as revealed in a “Survey among\nenergy sector experts” published by ABC in May 1978.8\n18 The survey was conducted among five leading experts of the Spanish energy scctor. These experts were Alfonso Alvarez Miranda,\npresident of FAE; Emilio Sanz Hurtado, manager of the oil company Petroliber and member of the Technical Commission of the\nMinister of Economy for the drafting of the NEP; Roberto Conteno, manager of the energy company Campsa and also member of the\nTechnical Commission of the Minister of Economy; Juan Alegre Marcet, president of Unesa (Association of Spanish electric\ncompanies), and Julio Calleja Gonzdlez-Camino, president of Hispanoil (another oil company). The survey comprised two questions:\n1. Do you suppart nuclear energy? 2. Would you nationalize the sector? To the first question, all five answers were “yes”, and ina\ncategorical manner, For the second question, there was a more nuanced response, with 2 “yes” and 3 “no” (ABC 1978c).\n\n13\n\nA draft of the second NEP was presented to Congress in July 1978, after major amendments to\nearlier drafts. According to E/ Pais, the positive reaction of the electrical and nuclear sectors indicated that\nthe private sector had again won the battle (El Pais 1978f). However, the NEP failed to gain approval, and\npublic debate on energy policy continued throughout the second half of 1978, with no changes in the\narguments presented by each side (El Periédico de Catalunya 1978a).\n\nThe first turning point in the nuclear debate was prompted by the celebration of the Austrian\nteferendum on nuclear energy on November 5 1978, related to approval for the start-up of the Zwentendorf\nNuclear Power Plant (Hirsch and Nowotny 1977; Pelinka 1983: 253-261). The referendum resulted in a\nnarrow majority against the Zwentendorf plan and represented an unexpected defeat for the European\nnuclear lobby as a whole. The right-wing newspaper ARC published a special report on the possibility of a\nnuclear referendum in Spain (ABC, 1978d) that included statements by representatives of the nuclear sector\n(e.g., the FAE President and the Director of the Nuclear Energy Board) on the need for nuclear energy to\nensure the economic development of the country (ABC, 1978e). The “bases of the anti-nuclear opposition”\nwere described by the ABC editorial staff on the same page as: the incomplete or developing nature of the\ntechnology; ecological disruption and pollution; lack of economic viability; progressive restriction of\nfreedoms to guarantee the security of nuclear facilities; higher concentration of economic and political\npower; and increasing foreign dependence in energy matters (ABC 1978f).\n\nThe FAE intensified its efforts to counteract the increasingly negative perception of the public and to\nsupport the nuclear option in the drafting of the new NEP. Besides the public appearances in the media, it set\nup a “Public Information Campaign” similar to those organized by the Industrial Forums in the USA, France\nand Switzerland and to the campaign launched by Foratom in the same year (Férum Atémico Espafiol 1978a:\n8). One of the main features of the campaign was the creation of a Public Opinion Working Group focused\non designing and carrying out opinion polls. According to the polling results obtained, nuclear energy was\nperceived as the most dangerous and most polluting option’®. It was seen as something new and mysterious\nbut with a bad reputation. In comparison to a poll by the Minister of Industry in 1975, the new polls revealed\na worsening of the public image of the nuclear industry (Férum Atémico Espafiol 1978a: 8). Other activities\nof the Working Group included the compilation of favorable news clippings for sending to news agencies\n(Férum Atémico Espafiol 1978c: 3) and an “immediate response” service to counter stories or articles in the\ndaily press that cast nuclear energy in a negative light (Férum Atémico Espafiol 1978d: 32-35). The public\ninformation campaign also invelved the publication of documents and public reports advocating nuclear\nenergy, the selection of audiences and topics for conferences or talks given by members of the FAE, and the\nachievement of media coverage for their presentations (Forum Atémico Espafiol 1978b: 24).\n\nFurther research is required to establish whether FAE’s public information campaign was effective in\nchanging the public perception of nuclear energy. However, one example of the limited success of FAE’s\nattempts to reshape the debate on nuclear energy in Spain may be the objections to the NEP draft raised by\naoe ey ‘was carried out during January and February 1978 by the consulting agency AGEUROP (Forum Atémico Espafiol\n\na: 8-10).\n14\n\nall political groups when it was discussed in Congress in December 1978, leading to the need for it to be\ntedrafted once again (E] Periddico de Catalunya 1978b).\n\nThe Three Mile Island (TMI) accident and the decline of the nuclear industry in Spain\n\nThe TMI accident is known as the first “major” accident in nuclear industry history. It occurred at TMI\nPower Plant in Pennsylvania, on March 28 1979, It represented a major shock to the nuclear industry, which\nhad emphasized the safety of the plants as one of the main arguments in the pro-nuclear discourse during the\n1970s, While the public health consequences of the accident remain controversial and have been described as\n“frustratingly ambiguous” (Walker 2000), consensus has been achieved on its major impact on the economy\nand on public opinion. According to the JAEA, the TMI accident was a significant turning point in the global\ndevelopment of nuclear power.” However, it has been claimed the accident did not initiate the demise of the\nnuclear power industry, as many planned nuclear power plants in USA had already been canceled between\n1973 and 1979.\"\n\nThe first reactions to the accident came from the US Nuclear industry representatives. In a display of\nhumility and concern, the president of the AIF Carl Walske declared: “I thought we were better than that\nbefore the accident happened”. In addition, William J. Lannouette, a journalist specialized in nuclear power,\nreported that some of them were “stunned and dispirited” (Walker 2006: 222). The nuclear sector as a whole\ndecided to take action to deal with the crisis. The AIF established a committee to coordinate communication\nactivities, realizing that this accident could cause severe damage to the nuclear industry worldwide (Walker\n2006: 223),\n\nIn Spain, the impact of the accident on public opinion was a matter of great concer to FAE leaders\nand the pro-nuclear lobby. Fears were also raised about its effects on the prospects for the NEP, which had\nyet to be approved and remained under public debate (Forum Atémico Espaiiol 1979b: 5-7). At a conference\nheld in Bilbao on the day after the accident, the new President of FAE, José Antonio Gallego Gredilla, stated\nthat they had to stick to the \"cold language of science, facts, and logic\" against the \"emotional and passionate\narguments\" used by anti-nuclear protestors (La Gaceta del Norte 1979).\n\nDuring 1979, some major anti-nuclear demonstrations took place in Spain against the NEP and in\nfavor of a nuclear moratorium, especially in Barcelona (El Periédico de Catalunya 1979a/ 1979b). Days after\nthe accident, in April 1979, a group of Spanish environmental organizations publicly called for the\nimmediate cessation of the Spanish nuclear development program and a five-year moratorium on building\nnuclear power plants to provide time for a thorough debate on the risks. The group claimed that Spain could\nmeet its energy needs without recourse to nuclear energy and demanded that the current NEP draft be\n29 From 1963 to 1979, the number of reactors under constriction globally increased every year except in 1971 and 1978 (ABA\n2012). However, following this event, the number of reactors under construction in the US declined every year from 1980 to 1998.\nMany similar Babcock and Wilcox reactors on order were canceled. Eventually, 51 American nuclear reactors were canceled from\n1980 to 1984 (EIA 1983).\n\n71 As a result of post-oil-shock analysis and conclusions of overcapacity, many planned nuclear power plants had already been\ncanceled between 1973 and 1979 due to more stringent Federal requirements, more strident local opposition and significantly\nlengthened construction times (Hertsgaard 1983: 95-97).\n\n15\n\nwithdrawn. from Congress and replaced by a transitional strategy that excluded nuclear energy (El Pais\n1979a).\n\nThe nuclear industry sector feared that the impact of the accident would focus the debate exclusively\non nuclear policy. There were also concerns about the plants under construction and those with prior\nauthorization sector, given the support for the nuclear moratorium announced by the Socialist and\nCommunist parties (Forum Atémico Espafiol 1979a: 17-20). The chairman of the Congress Energy\nCommittee, Josep Maria Triginer, claimed that the accident could even reinforce the Spanish nuclear\nprogram if it led to improvements in safety measures, although he admitted that it could ultimately lead the\ngovernment to reconsider the entire nuclear policy (El Periodico de Catalunya 1979c).\n\nThe government accepted the opposition’s proposals to improve the security and control of nuclear\nfacilities, but the new Minister of Industry and Energy, Carlos Bustelo ruted out any consideration of a\nmoratorium (ABC 1979). FAE representatives and the Working Group on Public Opinion published\ninformative notes detailing the technical causes of the accident. However, a print media analysis carried out\nby the FAE yielded very disappointing results, because the nuclear sector had expected a less aggressive\ntreatment of the issue by the media (Forum Atomico Espariol 1979b: 7).\n\nThe new NEP was eventually approved by Congress on July 27 1979. The absence of previsions for\nthe massive nuclearization of the country is attributable to the active civil opposition to the plan, the TMI\naccident, and delays in the construction of the new nuclear power plants due to the immense investment costs\ninvolved, among others (Cuerdo 1999: 161-178). Priority was given to local resources, such as coal and.\nhydraulic power, as had been proposed in the second draft of the Plan. The approved NEP gave nuclear\nenergy a place as a complementary source for completing the energy supply, but only under “the strictest\nsecurity measures” (El Pais 1979b). This was seen as a victory for the environmentalist and anti-nuclear\nmovements in Spain (Fernandez 1999: 302) and a discouraging decision for the nuclear sector and the FAE.\nIn late March 1984, the Socialist government approved a moratorium, and only 11 out of the 37 originally\nplanned commercial nuclear reactors (including 20 already licensed) were finally built in Spain.\n\nConclusion\n\nAlthough nuclear energy had been a controversial issue since the 1950s, the expansion of the nuclear\nindustry during the 1960s and 1970s stimulated the growth of anti-nuclear movements and brought the\nnuclear debate into the public arena. Despite the complexity of the international anti-nuclear scenario in the\nlate 1970s, several general trends can be identified, including the intensification of the protest as the growth\nof nuclear programs increased and the coalition of different interest groups against nuclear energy. Nuclear\nindustrial associations emerged and played a key role in advocating nuclear energy with varying degrees of\nsupport from the national governments.\n\nAs in other countries developing a nuclear program, the FAE took a leading role as representative of\nthe Spanish nuclear sector. The lack of democracy in the 1960s reduced the importance and public visibility\nof anti-nuclear movements. Not surprisingly, therefore, FAE’s concerns about public opinion emerged later\n\n16\n\nthan in other countries. By the mid-1970s, the combination of an intense anti-nuclear struggle and growing\ncalls for democracy in Spain led the FAE to enter the public arena with different communication strategies.\nTheir main arguments included the need for nuclear power to meet increasing energy needs, the problems of\ncoal and alternative energy sources, and the high safety record of nuclear power. Their strategy was to\noppose anti-nuclear claims on nuclear costs, safety and waste management.\n\nAnti-nuclear protests peaked in Spain in the late 1970s during the long debate before approval of the\nsecond NEP in July £979, confronting the pro-nuclear discourse with warnings about the potential dangers\nand the enormous investment required. The anti-nuclear movement in Spain was heterogeneous and highly\ninfluenced by regionalist and nationalist movements and by the demands for democracy, which gave anti-\nnuclear protests in Spain certain distinctive features. The first NEP approved in 1975 envisaged what was\nperceived at the time as the nuclearization of Spain. After the first democratic elections in Spain in 1977, the\nso-called Pactos de la Moncloa generated a political commitment to mid-term energy planning resulting in\nthe second 10-year NEP (1977-1987). The public debate on nuclear energy taking place in the late 1970s\naround the drafting of the new NEP paralleled a deterioration of the public image of the nuclear industry,\nwhich was exacerbated by the results of the 1978 Austrian referendum on nuclear energy and especially by\nnews of the TMI accident, In fact, the impact of the TMI accident appears to have been crucial in persuading\nthe Spanish government to abandon their plan for nuclear energy to be the main energy source, as eventually\nembodied in the 1979 NEP. From 1978 onwards, the FAE mounted a highly active public campaign to\ncounteract the increasingly negative perception of nuclear energy in Spanish public opinion. The campaign,\nprobably unrivalled in any other Spanish industrial sector, was similar to those launched by nuclear lobbies\nin the USA and the rest of Europe. The final version of the 1979 NEP was perceived by the FAE and the\nnuclear sector as a bitter defeat and by the Spanish environmental and anti-nuclear movements as a sweet\nvictory.\n\nReferences\n\nABC. 1978a, “Hay que ahorrar energia y reestructurar el sector”.

The 1955 conference in Geneva is misnamed: It was the\nInternational Conference on the Peaceful Uses of Atomic Energy.\nResponse: We now give the correct name of the conference.\nComment 2. Far more substantially, the author gives us no idea at all of the social make-up of\nthe protest movement in Spain, This is a serious omission and needs to be rectified. Nor are\nwe told much about the regional diversity of that protest movement, We are made aware of\nETAs violent opposition to nuclear power, but we are told little or nothing about the peaceful\nprotesters in the Basque region, in Catalonia, and in the capital, Madrid — for example.\nGranted the importance of regional differences in Spain this is a nuance that needs to be\nincluded in a more detailed analysis of just who was against nuclear power, what forms their\nprotest took, and how their opposition was managed by the authorities (apart from eventually\nbacking off from their earlier strong support for the nuclear option).\nResponse: We agree that it would be very helpful to provide further information on the\nregional diversity of the protest movement. We have included a new paragraph in section 5\n[The late anti-nuclear awakening in Spain: From Palomares (1966) to the “Long Anti-nuclear\nMarch” {1974-1977}] exploring how opposition to nuclear power plants became a valuable\ntool for the nationalist movements to expand their presence in the public space in terms of the\npolitical opportunities presented by mass mobilizations. Moreover, we have provided further\ndetails on the protests carried out in the Basque Country and Catalonia.\nWe very much appreciate the work put in by this reviewer and the positive remarks.\nReviewer #2:\nComment 1. The text first describes the American and European anti-nuclear movement,\nbefore introducing the Spanish case. However, it fails to take into consideration the fact that\nthe latter was active during a brutal dictatorship which prohibited any expression of opposition\nor questioning of the regimes policies in any shape or form; in this case its political and\neconomic policies. This aspect, which, when it is discussed in the text, is given insufficient\nclarity and importance, totally conditioned not only the policies of Francos regime with regard\nto nuclear development, but also the strategies of the Spanish anti-nuclear movement. The\nreality of the Spanish political situation in the 1960s, as well as in the 1970s and 1980s, makes\nit impossible to refer to a homogeneous \"Spanish\" anti-nuclear movement. The processes of\nnational liberation (Catalonia, the Basque Country, later terrorist acts), open opposition to the\ndictatorship {far-left parties and non-parliamentary movements}, the indecision and\nsubsequent acceptance by the Spanish Communist Party (PCE) and the Spanish Socialist Party\n(PSOE until the 80s) of the nuclear option, the anti-NATO movement, etc. make the Spanish\ncase one that is difficult to compare with the rest of the international anti-nuclear movements\nin the way that the article seems to suggest. It is only later that the dynamics of the anti-\nnuclear and pro-peace movement (against NATO) can be compared with other social\nmovements in Europe: its (albeit indecisive) influence on the nuclear moratorium and the\nsocio-cultural impact of the campaign against Spain joining NATO and against compulsory\nmilitary service.\nIn this regard, there are a number of publications that the author should take into account:\n\nRaul Lopez Romo, (2008) «Tifiendo la patria de verde y violeta. Las relaciones del nacionalismo\nvasco radical con los movimientos antinuclear y feminista en la Transicién», in: Ayeres en\ndiscusion: temas clave de Historia Contemporanea hoy\", coord. by Maria Encarna\n\nNicolas Marin, Carmen Gonzdlez Martinez, 2008.\n\nRaul Lépez Romo, Daniel Lanero Tdboas.

El moviment ecologista a Catalunya: el seu origen, evolucid i insercié a la\nsocietat catalana. Doctoral thesis. Universitat Autonoma de Barcelona Barcelona, September\n2012.\n\nResponse: We are very grateful for the information and references on the regional diversity of\nthe protest movement. We have included a new paragraph in section 5 exploring how\nopposition to nuclear power plants became a valuable tool for the nationalist movements to\nexpand their presence in the public space in terms of the political opportunities presented by\nmass mobilizations. Moreover, we have provided further details on the protests carried out in\nthe Basque Country, Galicia and Catalonia. We have also commented on the way in which the\nFrancoist repressive system affected the protest in Spain.\n\nWe have also completed the section in which the Lemoniz incident is described [Section 6:\nLeméniz conflict, the drafting of the second National Energy Plan and the reaction of the\nSpanish Atomic Forum (1978)]. The papers by Lopez Romo on the Lemoniz conflict cited by the\nreviewer proved highly valuable for this purpose, deepening the analysis of the conflict,\nexploring the links between ETA and the anti-nuclear movement in the Basque Country, and\nexamining further reactions of the civil society to the event.\n\nWe are grateful to the reviewer for the suggested reading on these topics, improving\nunderstanding of the links between the nationalist protest and the anti-nuclear movements,\nespecially in the Basque Country and Catalonia.\n\nComment 2. Moreover, it is not sufficient to analyse newspapers published in Madrid, such as\nABC and El Pais, in order to understand the process. It is essential also to include publications\nby the antinuclear movement, such as: BIEN - Boletin de Informacién sobre Energia Nuclear.\nComité Antinuclear de Catalunya. A good introduction can be found in: Alemany, J. (1995). \"El\nmoviment ecologista a través de les seves publicacions\". Catalonia Culture, 42, pp. 32-35. In\naddition, newspapers which reflect regionalist and nationalist perspectives such as Punto y\nHora de Eukal Herria, Egin, La Gazeta del Norte, Tele/eXpres, Mundo Diario, Avui, El Periddico\nde Catalunya should be consulted.\n\nResponse: We have now included analyses of two regional newspapers: La Gaceta del Norte\nand El Periddico de Catalunya, Unfortunately, we have been unable to gain access to the other\nsuggested sources.\n\nComment 3. Furthermore, the structure of the Spanish nuclear programme during the years of\nthe dictatorship deserves a more in-depth analysis than that put forward by the author. The in-\nfighting within the regime itself during the period of the autocracy, as exemplified by Suanzes,\nits main ideologue, and Otero Navascués, the head of the nuclear programme, are key to\nunderstanding the success of the change of orientation proposed by the \"technocrats\" and the\ntechnological options of the electrical companies, but this is not described in the article,\nStudies devoted to the history of the electrical companies involved are also of interest:\n\nAnes, G. y Gémez Mendoza, A.. 2006. \"Un siglo de luz: historia empresarial de Iberdrola\".\n(Madrid): Iberdrola.\n\nAnes, G., S.

El Estado y el desarrollo de la energia nuclear en Espaiia,\nc. 1950-1985.\n\nResponse: We are grateful for this comment and for the valuable bibliographic\nrecommendations. We have added new information and citations on this issue in section 4\n[The nuclear industry in Spain (1962-1976)]\n\nWe have included a new paragraph on the relevance of conflicts and divergences within the\nSpanish Government in order to understand how the view proposed by the technocrats was\nreinforced. We have also expanded our description of the process of development of the\nSpanish nuclear program, based on information provided by the paper of De la Torre and\nRubio (2013). Furthermore, we have completed the details of the electric companies involved\nin the nuclear sector, using data published by G6mez Mendoza (2007) and Anes et al. (2001).\nWe are very grateful for the insights and recommendations of this reviewer, which have led to\nmajor improvements in our paper.\n\n",
