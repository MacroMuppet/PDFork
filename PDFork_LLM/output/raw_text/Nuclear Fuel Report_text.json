Report: Global Scenarios for Demand\nand Supply Availability 2023-2040. —\n\nhitps:/Aworld-nuclear.org/our-association/publications/global-trends-reports/nuclear-fuel-report 13\n\n213/25, 4:29 AM Global Scenarios for Demand and Supply Availability 2023-2040 - World Nuclear Association\nThe report considers three scenarios, the Reference Scenario,\ninformed by government and utility targets and objectives, the\nLower Scenario, which assumes delays in implementing these\nplans, and the Upper Scenario, which is underpinned by more\nfavourable conditions, largely reflecting the targets announced in\nmany countries to achieve net-zero carbon emissions, and the\nacceptance that nuclear power will play an indispensable role in\nreaching this goal.\n\nFrom the current 391 GWe of operable nuclear capacity, the\nReference Scenario projects that nuclear capacity will reach 686\nGWe by 2040 (up 71 GWe from the 2021 edition), with capacity\nreaching 931 GWe in the Upper Scenario {up 92 GWe) and 486\nGWe in the Lower Scenario (up 37 GWe).\n\nWorld reactor requirements for uranium in 2023 are estimated at\nabout 65,650 tU. In the Reference Scenario these are expected to\nrise to almost 130,000 tU in 2040, with requirements rising to\n184,300 tU in the Upper Scenario and nearly 87,000 tU in the\nLower Scenario by the same date.\n\nGeopolitical instability, notably resulting from the Russia-Ukraine\nwar has also led to increased interest in nuclear power for energy\nsecurity and sovereignty. The same instability has had significant\nimplications for the globalized market for nuclear fuel cycle\nservices, with utilities, suppliers and governments in North America\nand Europe pursuing opportunities to diversify supplies.\nExtending the planned operating lifetimes of the existing fleet of\nnuclear reactors is one of the positive changes from the previous\nedition of the report. Several countries with larger reactor fleets are\nallowing existing plants to operate for up to 60 years, and in the\nUSA, to 80 years. Upwards of 140 reactors could be subject to\nextended operation in the period to 2040, driven by economics,\nemissions reduction targets, as well as security of supply.\nTogether with gigawatt-scale reactors, governments, utilities and\nindustrial end-users are showing a strong interest in small modular\nreactors and microreactors, including advanced designs that offer\nsimpler construction and financing. SMRs contribute up to 10% of\ntotal large-scale capacity in the Upper Scenario in 2040, although\nonly 0.4% in the Lower Scenario.\n\nPrimary production of uranium from mines, conversion plants and\nenrichment plants continues to supply the majority of the demand\nfor nuclear reactors around the globe. In the near term, secondary\n\nhitps:/Aworld-nuclear.org/our-association/publications/global-trends-reports/nuclear-fuel-report 213\n\n213/25, 4:29 AM Global Scenarios for Demand and Supply Availability 2023-2040 - World Nuclear Association\nsupplies of uranium will continue to play a role in bridging the gap\nbetween supply and demand. However, secondary supply is\nprojected to have a gradually diminishing role in the world market,\ndecreasing from the current level in supplying 11-14% of reactor\nuranium requirements to 4-11% in 2050.\n\nWorld Nuclear Association Member organisations can download a\nPDF of the report from the Members website.\nOUR ASSOCIATION ADDRESS\nOur Mission York House,\nLeadership 23 Kingsway,\nLondon,\nOur Members WC2B 6U),\nVacancies United Kingdom\nContact Us\nGENERAL ENQUIRIES.
