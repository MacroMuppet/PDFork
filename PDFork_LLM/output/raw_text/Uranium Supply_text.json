In the uranium\nmarket, however, high prices in the late 1970s gave way to depressed prices in the whole\nof the period of the 1980s and 1990s, with spot prices below the cost of production for all\nbut the lowest cost mines. Spot prices recovered from 2003 to 2009, but have been weak\nsince then.\nThe quoted spot prices through to about 2007 applied only to day-to-day marginal trading\nand represented a small portion of supply, though since 2008 the proportion has veo.\napproximately doubled, to about one-quarter in the last decade. Most trade is via 3-15 =\nhttps://world-nuclear.org/information-library/nuclear-fuel-cycle/uranium-resources/uranium-markets 110\n\n2113/25, 4:19 AM Uranium Markets - World Nuclear Association\nyear term contracts with producers selling directly to utilities at a higher price than the spot\nmarket, reflecting the security of supply. The specified price in these contracts is, however,\noften related to the spot price at the time of delivery.\nIn 2000, primary market participants — utilities and producers — accounted for 95% of the\nspot market. That share decreased to two-thirds by 2005 and one-third by 2011 and it\nhas remained at 30-40% since. The rest comes from the financial community, namely\ntraders and financiers who have moved in on the market, bringing greater liquidity and\nefficiency.\nThe reasons for fluctuation in mineral prices relate to demand and perceptions of scarcity.\nThe price cannot indefinitely stay below the cost of production, nor will it remain at very\nhigh levels for longer than it takes for new producers to enter the market and anxiety about\nsupply to subside.\nSpot and long-term uranium prices (2000-2023)\n1H\n10-—$—<$£_£_  _—$_$_$___ | TE\nay ATS HLS\nfits A gen Rts.\"\nso ——c_ pi A |e\nfi ames tT AN pee fi\nLe ng PE | Makes | >\n¥2o0b 2002 fp004 gods: aoa!

This includes\ninitial cores for new reactors coming online. The capacity is growing slowly, and at the\nsame time the reactors are being run more productively, with higher capacity factors, and\nreactor power levels. However, these factors increasing fuel demand are offset by a trend\nfor increased efficiencies, so demand is dampened — over the 20 years from 1970 there\nwas a 25% reduction in uranium demand per kWh output in Europe due to such\nimprovements, which continue today.\nEach GWe of increased new capacity will require about 150 tU/yr of extra mine production\nroutinely, and about 300-450 tU for the first fuel load.\nFuel burn-up is measured in units such as MW days per tonne U (MWd/tU). Increases in\nburn-up reduce the number of fresh fuel assemblies which need to be loaded. Higher burn-\nups therefore result in potential cost savings for the utility at both ends of the fuel cycle.\nHowever, increases in burn-up sometimes (but not always) require increased enrichment\nlevels in the fuel assemblies, which increases the uranium and/or the enrichment needed\nfor each assembly, thus increasing the cost of each assembly. During 1980-2010 burn-up\nlevels increased, compared with original designs, to around 40,000 MWadftU for most\nLWRs, with reductions in specific uranium consumption. Some utilities have continued to\nincrease burn-ups further, and levels of 45-50 GWdAU are now common. However,\nincreasing burn-up above 40 GWd/tU only reduces specific uranium consumption slightly,\nwhile very slightly increasing specific enrichment requirements. For example, an increase\nfrom 40 to 50 GWad/tU reduces uranium requirements by 4-5% and increases enrichment\nrequirements by about 2-3%.\nGenerally, utilities have pursued higher enrichment and burn-ups, and when uranium |\nprices were high they specified low tails assays from enrichment, to get more fuel from it,\nhttps://world-nuclear.org/information-library/nuclear-fuel-cycle/uranium-resources/uranium-markets 310\n\n2113/25, 4:19 AM Uranium Markets - World Nuclear Association\nso that significantly less natural uranium feed was required. However, more enrichment\nenergy was then needed. There is a clear trade-off between energy input to enrichment\nand uranium input.\nPercentage variation in uranium requirements and separative work unit (SWU)\nrequirements with different tails assays\n$0.0\n$$ —p_@_@@@@@_$€_/$?_$_€_ seperti\nO] 012 O14t 1016) O18 ..0.20e0 20: Thee. 026 078s oat O82 pad\nSa —_..,\na\neen \"Tails assay (%).\n: \"= Changelin uranium reqiitements @: —+Changein SWU requirements (2\nNotes: from a base tails assay of 0.22% U-235\nSource: World Nuclear Association\nBecause of the cost structure of nuclear power generation, with high capital and low fuel\ncosts, the demand for uranium fuel is much more predictable than with probably any other\nmineral commodity. Once reactors are built, it is very cost-effective to keep them running at\nhttps://world-nuclear.org/information-library/nuclear-fuel-cycle/uranium-resources/uranium-markets 40\n\n2113/25, 4:19 AM Uranium Markets - World Nuclear Association\nhigh capacity and for utilities to make any adjustments to load trends by cutting back on\nfossil fuel use. Demand forecasts for uranium thus depend largely on installed and\noperable capacity, regardless of economic fluctuations. However, this picture is\ncomplicated by policies which give preferential grid access to subsidized wind and solar\nPV sources.\nLooking ten years ahead, the market is expected to grow. The Reference Scenario of the\n2023 edition of the World Nuclear Association's Nuclear Fuel Report shows a 28%\nincrease in uranium demand over 2023-30 (for an 18% increase in reactor capacity —\nmany new cores will be required). Demand thereafter will depend on new plants being\nbuilt and the rate at which older plants are retired — the Reference Scenario of the\n2023 Nuclear Fuel Report has a 51% increase in uranium demand for the decade 2031-\n2040. Licensing of plant lifetime extensions and the economic attractiveness of continued\noperation of older reactors are critical factors in the medium-term uranium market.\nHowever, with electricity demand by 2040 potentially increasing by about 50% from that\nof 2022 (based on the International Energy Agency's World Energy Outlook 2023 report),\nthere is plenty of scope for growth in nuclear capacity in a world concerned with limiting\ncarbon emissions.\nSupply\nMines in 2022 supplied some 58,201 tonnes of uranium oxide concentrate (U30g)\ncontaining 49,355 tU, 74% of the utilities' annual requirements (see also information page\non World Uranium Mining). The balance is made up from secondary sources including\nstockpiled uranium held by utilities, and in the last few years of low prices those civil\nstockpiles have been built up again following their depletion over 1990-2005. At the end of\n2022 they were estimated at about 36,000 tU in Europe, 40,000 tU in the USA,\nabout 132,000 tU in China, and about 49,000 tU in the rest of Asia.\nNote that at the prices which utilities are likely to be paying for current delivery, only one-\nthird of the cost of the fuel loaded into a nuclear reactor is the actual ex-mine (or other) |\nhttps://world-nuclear.org/information-library/nuclear-fuel-cycle/uranium-resources/uranium-markets 510\n\n2113/25, 4:19 AM Uranium Markets - World Nuclear Association\n\nsupply. The balance is mostly the cost of enrichment and fuel fabrication, with a small\nelement for uranium conversion.\nWith the main growth in uranium demand being in Russia and China, it is noteworthy that\nthe vertically-integrated sovereign nuclear industries in these countries (and potentially\nIndia) have sought equity in uranium mines abroad, bypassing the market to some extent.\nStrategic investment in uranium production, even if itis not lowest-cost, has become the\npriority while world prices have been generally low. Russia's ARMZ bought Canada-based\nUranium One in 2013, and China holds equity in mines in Niger, Namibia, Kazakhstan,\nUzbekistan and Canada.\nSupply from elsewhere\nAs well as existing and likely new mines, nuclear fuel supply may be from secondary\nsources including:\n\nRecycled uranium and plutonium from used fuel, as mixed oxide (MOX) fuel.\n\nRe-enriched depleted uranium tails.\n\nEx-military weapons-grade uranium, blended down.\n\nCivil stockpiles.\n\nEx-military weapons-grade plutonium, as MOX fuel.\nCommercial reprocessing plants are operating in France and Russia with a combined\ncapacity of about 2000 tonnes of heavy metal (tHM)} per year. World reprocessing capacity\nwould increase by 800 tHM with the restart of the Japanese plant at Rokkasho-Mura.\nFurther capacity is under construction in Russia and China, and there are a number of\nother plants with small reprocessing capacities worldwide.\n\nhttps://world-nuclear.org/information-library/nuclear-fuel-cycle/uranium-resources/uranium-markets 60\n\n2113/25, 4:19 AM Uranium Markets - World Nuclear Association\n\nMilitary uranium for weapons was enriched to much higher levels than that for the civil fuel\ncycle. Weapons-grade material is about 97% U-235, and this can be diluted about 25:1\nwith depleted uranium (or 30:1 with enriched depleted uranium) to reduce it to about 4%,\nsuitable for use in a power reactor. From 1999 to 2013 the dilution of 30 tonnes per year of\nsuch material displaced about 9720 tonnes U3Og per year of mine production. (See also\npage on Military Warheads as a Source of Nuclear Fuel.)\nThe following graph gives an historical perspective, showing how early production went\nfirst into military inventories and then, in the early 1980s, into civil stockpiles. It is this early\nproduction which has made up the shortfall in supply from mines since the mid-1980s.\nHowever, the shortfall is diminishing towards the level of continuing secondary supplies.\nWorld uranium production and reactor requirements, 1945-2022, tU\n\n88.000\n\n8§98,90$@$}° — imi ii ii\n\nBs a) a anaes Vea Q :\n\n50,0005, 7 ra ‘A. vant > =\n\nPf40.000: THATS et ORY a & prt 1\n‘oi 2 5 nan A a perns Boe ro :\n“\"e4bii950 T9SS 196071968 TO70N975/4980 198534990:1995 2000; 200852010 2018'2020;2028\niF owls: “Hussy = - Ei abikiatany; =.
