In the\nuranium market, however, high prices in the late 1970s gave way\nto depressed prices in the whole of the period of the 1980s and\n1990s, with spot prices below the cost of production for all but the\nlowest cost mines. Spot prices recovered from 2003 to 2009, but\nhave been weak since then.\nThe quoted spot prices through to about 2007 applied only to day-\nto-day marginal trading and represented a small portion of supply,\nthough since 2008 the proportion has approximately doubled, to\nabout one-quarter in the last decade. Most trade is via 3-15 year\nterm contracts with producers selling directly to utilities at a higher\nprice than the spot market, reflecting the security of supply. The\nspecified price in these contracts is, however, often related to the oe\nspot price at the time of delivery. “)\nracy «Terms\nhttps:world-nuclear.org/information-library/nuclear-fuel-cycle/uranium-resources/uranium-markets#supply-from-elsewhere 19\n\n2113/25, 4:27 AM Uranium Markets « World Nuclear Association\n\nIn 2000, primary market participants — utilities and producers —\naccounted for 95% of the spot market. That share decreased to\ntwo-thirds by 2005 and one-third by 2011 and it has remained at\n30-40% since. The rest comes from the financial community,\nnamely traders and financiers who have moved in on the market,\nbringing greater liquidity and efficiency.\nThe reasons for fluctuation in mineral prices relate to demand and\nperceptions of scarcity. The price cannot indefinitely stay below the\ncost of production, nor will it remain at very high levels for longer\nthan it takes for new producers to enter the market and anxiety\nabout supply to subside.\nSpot and long-term uranium prices (2000-2023)\ngq)\nog ————_____——__\n\n50 ———————c— li— —L— —! hos\n\n° 2000 2002 2004 2006 ‘2008 2010 2012 2014 2016 2078 2020 2022 2024\n\n— Uranium spot price (6/Ib U,0,)  — Long-term uranum price ($/lb U,0,)\nSource: Cameco, UxC, TradeTech\nDemand\nAbout 440 reactors with combined capacity of about 390 GWe\nrequire some 80,000 tonnes of uranium oxide concentrate\ncontaining about 67,500 tonnes of uranium (tU) from mines (or the\nequivalent from stockpiles or secondary sources) each year. This\nincludes initial cores for new reactors coming online. The capacity is\ngrowing slowly, and at the same time the reactors are being run\nmore productively, with higher capacity factors, and reactor power\nlevels, However, these factors increasing fuel demand are offsetby |\na trend for increased efficiencies, so demand is dampened — over “)\nthe 20 years from 1970 there was a 25% reduction in uranium |\nhttps:/world-nuclear.org/information-library/nuclear-fuel-cycle/uranium-resources/uranium-markets#supply-from-elsewhere 29\n\n2113/25, 4:27 AM Uranium Markets « World Nuclear Association\n\ndemand per kWh output in Europe due to such improvements,\nwhich continue today.\nEach GWe of increased new capacity will require about 150 tU/yr of\nextra mine production routinely, and about 300-450 tU for the first\nfuel load.\nFuel burn-up is measured in units such as MW days per tonne U\n(MWd/tU}. Increases in burn-up reduce the number of fresh fuel\nassemblies which need to be loaded. Higher burn-ups therefore\nresult in potential cost savings for the utility at both ends of the fuel\ncycle. However, increases in burn-up sometimes (but not always)\nrequire increased enrichment levels in the fuel assemblies, which\nincreases the uranium and/or the enrichment needed for each\nassembly, thus increasing the cost of each assembly. During 1980-\n2010 burn-up levels increased, compared with original designs, to\naround 40,000 MWd/tU for most LWRs, with reductions in specific\nuranium consumption. Some utilities have continued to increase\nburn-ups further, and levels of 45-50 GWd/tU are now common.\nHowever, increasing burn-up above 40 GWad/tU only reduces\nspecific uranium consumption slightly, while very slightly increasing\nspecific enrichment requirements. For example, an increase from 40\nto 50 GWad/tU reduces uranium requirements by 4-5% and\nincreases enrichment requirements by about 2-3%,\nGenerally, utilities have pursued higher enrichment and burn-ups,\nand when uranium prices were high they specified low tails assays\nfrom enrichment, to get more fuel from it, so that significantly less\nnatural uranium feed was required. However, more enrichment\nenergy was then needed. There is a clear trade-off between energy\ninput to enrichment and uranium input.\nPercentage variation in uranium requirements and\nseparative work unit (SWU) requirements with different tails\nassays\n\nee\n\na\n\nhttps:world-nuclear.org/information-library/nuclear-fuel-cycle/uranium-resources/uranium-markets#supply-from-elsewhere 38\n\n2113/25, 4:27 AM Uranium Markets « World Nuclear Association\n\n40.0 —_—$—— — — —\nCO OO TgTTTT nl\n2.9 ——— ri  !} mL  —_—\n0.0 eee\n\n0.

Once reactors are built, it is very cost-effective to keep\nthem running at high capacity and for utilities to make any\nadjustments to load trends by cutting back on fossil fuel use.\nDemand forecasts for uranium thus depend largely on installed and\noperable capacity, regardless of economic fluctuations. However,\nthis picture is complicated by policies which give preferential grid\naccess to subsidized wind and solar PV sources.\nLooking ten years ahead, the market is expected to grow. The\nReference Scenario of the 2023 edition of the World Nuclear\nAssociation's Nuclear Fue! Report shows a 28% increase in\nuranium demand over 2023-30 (for an 18% increase in reactor\ncapacity — many new cores will be required). Demand thereafter\nwill depend on new plants being built and the rate at which older\nplanis are retired — the Reference Scenario of the 2023 Nuclear Fuel\nReport has a 51% increase in uranium demand for the decade\n2031-2040, Licensing of plant lifetime extensions and the economic\nattractiveness of continued operation of older reactors are critical\nfactors in the medium-term uranium market.

Weapons-grade material is about\n97% U-235, and this can be diluted about 25:1 with depleted\nuranium (or 30:1 with enriched depleted uranium) to reduce it to\nabout 4%, suitable for use in a power reactor.
