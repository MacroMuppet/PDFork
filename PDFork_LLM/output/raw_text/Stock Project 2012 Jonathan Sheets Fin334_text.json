My thoughts that ALXN would run-up to its December PDUFA amid speculation, \nproved to be horribly false. ALGN was a horrible performer as well. I guess I should have \ndiversified more within my healthcare picks and my portfolio as a whole. It was surprising to see \nSLV hold up pretty well given that the market appears to be discounting Bernankeâ€™s ability to \nprint money into infinity. I should have foreseen the effect of the Fiscal Cliff on the markets, and \ntried to buy special dividend issuers. TCBI was a surprising non-mover after a strong summer \nperformance. \n \nIt also appears I am due to get 4/5 regardless of what I write about in this paragraph because I \ndid not further diversify my portfolio. That is what I get for not reading all of the rules. I have \ntranslated this life lesson into reading all of the CQA rules so that we are not disqualified. As of \nthe current standings in that competition we are 2nd in returns, 1st in Sharpe, and 1st in \nAlpha/Beta rankings. \n \n\n",
