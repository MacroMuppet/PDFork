Uranium is a common metal found in rocks all over the world.\nUranium occurs in combination with small amounts of other elements. Economically recoverable uranium reserves are located in the\nwestern United States, Australia, Canada, Central Asia, Africa, and South America.\nUranium production in the United States peaked in 1980, and uranium purchases by U.S. nuclear power plant operators from domestic\nsuppliers peaked in 1981. Since 1992, the majority of uranium purchased by U.S. nuclear power plant operators was imported.\nhttps:/Awww.eia.gov/energyexplained/nuclear/where-our-uranium-comes-from.php 43\n\n2/13/25, 4:21 AM Where our uranium comes from - U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA)\nSources of uranium for U.S. nuclear power plants, 1950-2022\nmillion pounds of uranium oxide\n0 =\n600—§ S$ HZJAT}]NTNTNNNNH,__ 1,\n| ey eG\n408 es dA OY\n30 ————, — ————\n20. ————_f— KNOL i\nee\n10 ———f———— eee\ni)\n1950 1960 1970 1980 1990 2000 2010 2020\n— domestic concentrate production\n— purchased imports\n— U.S. power plant purchases from domestic suppliers\nData source: U.S. Energy Information Administration, Monthly Energy Review, Table 8.2, June 2023\nZIT) Note: Data withheld for U.S. power plant purchases from domestic suppliers in 2019 and for domestic production in 2020 to\n@1a! avoid disclosure of individual company data.\nClick to enlarge\nOwners and operators of U.S. civilian nuclear power reactors purchased 40.5 million pounds of U,Oge (equivalent) from U.S. and foreign\nsuppliers during 2022.\nhttps:/Avww.eia.govlenergyexplained/nuclear'where-our-uranium-comes-from.php 213\n\n2113/25, 4:21 AM Where our uranium comes from - U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA)\nSources and percentage shares of total U.S. purchases of uranium in 2022 were:\ni 0, i i) : f°) : [s)\n| Canada | Kazakhstan _ Russia _ Uzbekistan\n199 | f°)\n9% 16%\nAustralia Six other countries combined\nData source: Uranium Marketing Annual Report, Table 3, June 2023\nNote: The six other countries include Germany, Malawi, Namibia, Niger, South Africa, and the United States with country data withheld to\nprotect individual company data.\nLast updated: August 23, 2023, with data available from source reports as indicated.\nhttps:/Awww.eia.gov/energyexplained/nuclear/where-our-uranium-comes-from.php 33,\n\n",
