Of the $37 million in shareholder funds, \n$20 million would be  a penalty paid to the State of California ’s General Fund and $17 million would \nbe spent on pole loading assessments and resulting remediation work in Malibu Canyon and \nsurroun ding areas.  \n \nUnder the settlement agreement, SCE admits it violated the law by not taking prompt action to  \nprevent telecommunications company NextG from attaching fiber optic cable to joint poles in \nMalibu  Canyon after an SCE planner determined in response  to a Joint Pole  Committee inquiry that \nNextG’s proposed attachment would cause poles in  Malibu Canyon to be overloaded.  Further, SCE \nadmits that one of its  employee s concluded that a replacement pole  did not comply  with the CPUC’s \nsafety regulations  for new construction, which should have caused SCE to take steps as early  as \nNovember 2007 to remedy the situation.  \n \nThe proposed settlement agreement represents 75 percent of the Safety and Enforcement Division’s \nrecommended penalty. “I am pleased to present this settlement agreement to the Commissioners for \ntheir consideration,” said Brigadier General (CA) Jack Hagan, the Director of the Safety and \nEnforcement Division.  “ As part of the settlement SCE  acknowledg es its responsibility in a major \nincident.  If t he settlement is approved it will go a long way toward making SCE’s system safer and \nmore reliable.”  \n\n \n 2 \n \nThe fire started on October 21, 2007, when Santa Ana winds swept through Malibu Canyon in Los \nAngeles County. Three utility poles located next to Malibu C anyon Road fell to the ground and \nignited a fire. The fire burned 3,836 acres, destroyed 14 structures and 36 vehicles, and damaged 19 \nother structures. The CPUC opened a penalty consideration case on January 29, 2009, to determine if \nAT&T, NextG, SCE, Spr int, and Verizon Wireless violated any provisions of the California Public \nUtilities Code and/or CPUC decisions, rules, or General Orders with respect to their facilities that \nwere involved in the ignition of the Malibu Canyon Fire, as the companies had fa cilities attached to \nthe fallen poles, and several were joint owners of the fallen poles.  \n \nThe proposed  settlement with SCE is the third and last settlement  regarding the fire . The first \nsettlement for $12 million between the Safety and Enforcement Divisio n and AT&T, Verizon , and \nSprint, was approved by the CPUC in September 2012 .  The second settlement between NextG and \nthe Safety and Enforcement Division  is pending Commissioner approval.  Assuming that the \nCommissioners approve the two pending settlements , the total amounts under all three settlements \nwould be $63.5 million, of which $35.4 million would go  to the General Fund and $28.1 million \nwould  go to remedial measures.  \n \nThe proposed settlement agreement is expected to come before the CPUC’s Commission ers for a \nvote later this year .  \n \nThe proposed settlement agreement  is available at  http://www.cpuc. ca.gov/NR/rdonlyres/BE491829 -3C66 -\n41A3 -BEE9 -D786744D62D3/0/I0901018SEDandSCEJointMotionforExpeditiousApprovalofSettlement.pdf . \n \nFor more information on the CPUC, please visit www.cpuc.ca.gov . \n### \n \n \n",
