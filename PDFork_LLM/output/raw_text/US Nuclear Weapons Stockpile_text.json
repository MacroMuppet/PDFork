These weapons\n—along with the submarines, ballistic missiles, and aircraft that deliver them—constitute the nation’s strategic deterrent. For more\nthan 75 years the nuclear deterrent has underpinned America's security, deterring our adversaries, reassuring our allies and partners,\nand promoting global stability.\nThe Office of Defense Programs is responsible for maintaining and modernizing the stockpile. Our engineers and technicians ensure\nthe health of the weapons by studying and replacing components and materials as they age. Scientists conduct experiments using\nsome of the most advanced facilities in the world to enhance our understanding of weapon performance. Production facilities\nmanufacture the thousands of materials and components that comprise modern nuclear weapons, assuring their long-term\nreliability.\nFE | ee ree SAT ae Ne PL tg a ee \\\nNURI |) fas POC SAR OLE ING Cre ht OA ES Dd Se Pf Po oo ES eaten \\ i\neee Las i Tg aa Feit: a: ou i‘ CH Ata aS tg — .

As the United States confronts the unprecedented challenge of deterring two nuclear peers,\nthe age of our stockpile requires an intensive modernization program. Likewise, our infrastructure has atrophied since the Cold War\nand must be recapitalized. As we revitalize our facilities and infrastructure, NNSA is building a responsive complex with modern\ntechnology, allowing us to adapt to changing requirements driven by shifting world conditions.\nThe transparency NNSA provides regarding our Nuclear Security Enterprise is unique among the world’s nuclear weapon states.\nDetails about nuclear weapons, the deterrence mission, and NNSA's management of the stockpile can be found in the current\nStockpile Stewardship and Management Plan and the Nuclear Matters Handbook.\nuf\nhttps:/Awww.energy.gow/nnsa/us-nuclear-weapons-stockpile 4H8\n\n2113128, 4:39 AM The U.S. Nuclear Weapons Stockpile | Department of Energy\nAt NNSA we are applying the power of science not simply to enhance U.S. security but in pursuit of a more peaceful, prosperous,\nand stable world.\nUS: Nuclear Weaporis Stockpile, 1945:2023\n{inctades active and inactive warheads:\nBBO $$\n| Max Warheads?/31)255 j\n36,000: |}: Cuban Missile: § F ()!\n25,000, |} |\" — | End of Cold War (1989)\nye oe\n20,000) }————_______—} oo\nt : \" F\n115,000; _f Sa\nif AW\n. i\n10,000: =f IY\n7 \\._ [asof2028:3,748)\n5,000; -—— f° SSS.\nof — oF\n1945; 1955! 1985; YS7S a aay ys $1995 91995 72005 2015 12023\nFiscal Year:\nThe Post-Cold War Stockpile\nThe U.S. nuclear stockpile is the smallest it has been since 1960. As of 2023, the stockpile stood at 3,748 warheads—a roughly 88\npercent reduction in size since its peak of 31,255 warheads in the late 1960s. Most weapons in the current stockpile were produced\nduring the 1970s and 1980s. At the time they were built, these weapons were not designed or intended to last indefinitely.\nAs a result of the voluntary moratorium on nuclear explosive testing the United States has observed since 1992, NNSA now ensures\nthe reliability of the nation’s nuclear weapons through the Stockpile Stewardship Program. Comprising a wide range of scientific\nactivities, from modeling and simulation to subcritical nuclear experiments, this program allows us to assess and certify the\nstockpile with extraordinary confidence.\nNevertheless, maintaining the stockpile today is much more difficult than during the Cold War. In addition to designing,\nmanufacturing, and sustaining weapons without nuclear explosive testing, we must accommodate arms contro! verification in our\nproduction processes and exercise care for the workforce and environment in every phase of the weapon lifecycle. Meeting these\nchallenges depends on the unparalleled ingenuity and resourcefulness of NNSA's Nuclear Security Enterprise.\nComposed of a nationwide network of national laboratories and production facilities and more than 65,000 nuclear security\nprofessionals, the enterprise conducts the research, development, testing, and production needed to deliver the nuclear stockpile\nto the U.S. military.\nnts: uwa-energy.govinnsalus-nuclear-weapons-stockpile “58\n\n2113/25, 4:39 AM The U.S. Nuclear Weapons Stockpile | Department of Energy\nInterested in a career in Defense Programs?\nNNSA shares responsibility for the nuclear deterrent with the Department of Defense (DoD).

To succeed, deterrence requires our adversaries to understand that the costs of aggression against\nthe United States or its allies and partners will always outweigh any conceivable benefits. The credibility of this guarantee requires a\nnuclear stockpile that is unfailingly reliable and effective.\nNNSA’s Stockpile Management Program encompasses the full range of a weapon's lifecycle, from design and development to\nproduction and maintenance and ultimately to dismantlement and disassembly. Each weapon type requires routine maintenance,\nrepair, replacement of limited life components, surveillance (the thorough examination of a weapon), and other activities to ensure\ntheir safety, security, effectiveness, and reliability.\nIn the current stockpile, the average duration since a warhead was manufactured or refurbished is roughly 28 years. Over the next\ntwo decades, the stockpile will be sustained and modernized through vigorous surveillance, assessment, life extension,\nmodification, acquisition, and dismantlement efforts. NNSA delivered more than 200 modernized weapons to the DoD in 2023\nalone—the most since the end of the Cold War—and comparable demand is expected over the next decade and beyond.\nOur scientists and engineers provide assurance that the United States can deliver militarily effective weapons. As we work with the\nDoD to evaluate the needs of the deterrent, NNSA will deliver new capabilities to fill deterrence gaps. NNSA is also undertaking\ntransformative initiatives to protect against adversary subversion of nuclear weapons and associated capabilities.\nTogether we supply the crucial ingredient needed for deterrence to succeed—our adversaries’ recognition that U.S. threats to\nretaliate swiftly and decisively against any strategic attack on the United States or its allies are backed by indisputable nuclear\ncapabilities.\n\nStockpile Sustainment\n\nWarhead Modernization\n\nProduction Operations\n\nNuclear Enterprise Assurance\n\nMore Information on Stockpile Management\n\nhttps:/Awww.energy.gow/nnsa/us-nuclear-weapons-stockpile 98\n\n2113/25, 4:39 AM The U.S. Nuclear Weapons Stockpile | Department of Energy\nwe ot ae 7 . zlotare ut : . ‘ . ot — ‘ ae oo &\nWSs alecearececsaine | (GF eMC ©, ar CEES OY (a\nie Ses tat rer ren: (Ee Boe I oP AIRE Sere ees ALG ss ras (ia a.\nEA i aan AS \\ V/A CRN) | cag CORR nica: == (eng\nGed er Mo pete Pie eR ee Bee PoNe ye oe RS SE fia ey\nSay TIS Se TN ge ORS PN ef JR\ntors he fe ee es Se ermememmrmeas C (ECETTRERIEE: \\\\ aad Ak En) Sak RED HEIRS AE a ee\neee eat it L od ena : we A PO SE PA ee a Es a = Wises\na = PP ie oe en ee pe dba erty Ff PAPE es en ED Oe\na a Oe cae ar ais YB a asap Ty WO aa ee TP APS eed Be SAA\nSst eons Re a 0 RES nn hae NA GER S\n3) Sandia National Labs tests a prototype of the Mark 21 fuze to ensure it meets requirements and specifications.\n°\nResearch, Development, Test, and Evaluation\nDeterrence of America’s adversaries hinges on the credibility of our nuclear capabilities, and the very foundation of the U.S. nuclear\ndeterrent is the scientific knowledge resident in and generated by the Nuclear Security Enterprise. Until 1992, the United States\ndemonstrated the reliability of the stockpile in part through nuclear explosive tests. Since the end of nuclear explosives testing,\nNNSA has established credibility by operating state-of-the-art science facilities, where research and development, modeling of\nnuclear weapons performance, and computer simulations serve as substitutes for nuclear explosive tests.\nnts: uwa-energy.govinnsalus-nuclear-weapons-stockpile “ote\n\n2113128, 4:39 AM The U.S. Nuclear Weapons Stockpile | Department of Energy\npre FO RAAERKE Ses ace Aone To Scene ace en a acre SSE eee\noo po ISTEBNA\nUno SAY pss 1 ens hig GPE leer Ee |\nMU iggy geen y npeeON NUNN) Me Teo a eee =\nLE AEDES SGN S50 SR er\na The 29-foot-radius indoor centrifuge used for flight environment testing at Sandia National Labs' Centrifuge Complex.\nNuclear fusion breakthroughs at the National Ignition Facility are advancing our understanding of the stockpile, deriving knowledge\nonce accessible only through nuclear explosive tests.

In addition to the fissile cores of the weapons, high\nexplosives are used to generate a nuclear detonation, and a multitude of non-nuclear components enable the reliable functioning of\nthe weapons.\nMuch of the production base that made these materials and components during the Cold War has since been shuttered. The United\nStates is now recapitalizing its production facilities and infrastructure as part of a broader strategy to modernize the nuclear\ndeterrent. This revitalized enterprise will enable timely adaptation to changing requirements driven by a shifting global security\nenvironment, all while avoiding much of the waste, inefficiency, and environmental toll that characterized the first decades of the\nnuclear age.\nMajor construction projects are underway across the country to refurbish existing facilities and build new, state-of-the-art\nproduction complexes for the nuclear stockpile. In particular, facilities are being built to manufacture the plutonium “pits” at the\nheart of our nuclear weapons and process uranium, lithium, and tritium for the stockpile. Such investments are critical to answering\nthe challenge of deterring two nuclear peer adversaries in the coming decades and assuring America’s allies and partners over the\nlong term.\nThese projects require extraordinary choreography to maintain current rates of production while simultaneously building the\ncapacity for the future stockpile. Furthermore, like many U.S. defense systems, nuclear weapons rely on commercially\nmanufactured parts and components, requiring close partnerships between NNSA and private sector companies to provide\nassurance that the quantity and quality of each meets the nation’s needs.\nAs the current weapons in our inventory age, NNSA must ensure the nuclear stockpile is properly sized and militarily effective for\nmany decades to come.\nPlutonium Pit Production\nnts: uwa-energy.govinnsalus-nuclear-weapons-stockpile “128\n\n2113128, 4:39 AM The U.S. Nuclear Weapons Stockpile | Department of Energy\nLithium Modernization\nTritium Modernization\nDomestic Uranium Enrichment\nEnriched Uranium Modernization\nDepleted Uranium Modernization\nHigh Explosives and Energetics\nNon-nuclear Components\nTechnology and Partnerships\nNNSA maintains partnerships with federal and non-federal entities to apply outside technical and commercial knowledge to sustain\nthe nuclear deterrent and advance broader national security missions.

At the intersection of these requirements sits a team of experts who provide the tailored\nprocesses, tools, and training for the federal workforce to manage nuclear stockpile programs and projects.\nThe Office of Systems Engineering and Integration is responsible for enabling informed decision-making across the nuclear security\nenterprise. This process involves systematically defining and implementing enterprise-level requirements to align stockpile\nactivities with the policy drivers of the deterrence mission. The office serves as the connective tissue between NNSA’s eight\nnational laboratories, plants, and sites in assessing and managing risk to the stockpile mission. Experts lead strategic planning and\nportfolio analyses concerning the workforce and production capacity, including modeling and simulation of NNSA‘s ability to\ndeliver nuclear weapons to the Department of Defense on schedules consistent with national security.\nAnother key function of the office is engaging with stakeholders inside and outside of the U.S. Government. Experts lead\nnegotiations with DoD counterparts concerning military requirements for U.S. nuclear weapons, engaging with the U.S. Air Force,\nNavy, Joint Staff, Office of the Secretary of Defense, and combatant commands. The office also works closely with partners in the\nprivate sector, performing industrial base monitoring to ensure suppliers of components and materials for the stockpile are\ncommercially viable. As part of this portfolio, we conduct supply chain risk management to confirm that critical supplies are\navailable and free from foreign subversion or manipulation. Together these activities provide assurance that the nuclear security\nenterprise can deliver a reliable and militarily effective stockpile for as long as our national security depends on it.\nnts: uwa-energy.govinnsalus-nuclear-weapons-stockpile “14a\n\n2113/25, 4:39 AM The U.S. Nuclear Weapons Stockpile | Department of Energy\neee\n0 eee oo\nat ered rae ON GA\npases wis ni Gee eri ler ON WAS fete NY eT eN UES On eae gem ER phere\nNes SENS Zoe FOS NEEL ACS Et PIO NEY ROE) Rte SEEN EEN\npee ae Mie wie Yard eet No ey RE ee Guts ehcaey nS re Sele een Cope ee it\nNCOs AOC eae Te ey, CON ERG:\nPAID SD | bcraracatcn Pod VR HAUSMAN CREAN Goo ENN ATE NEN AA FCAPS ATE Ap PMRW ES AL ON eh aa kn eet reel eR MERC NG RG Bepar Vee]\nPam Gre Seas snge uel Ney a See AN ISH) ase\nee NE cy See PEAS a ce OS CONES oe eS ES)\nSF lve SENN a eed EER Cogn SM SCR? yah ial § yibeh ae ably; UNTER RSS TE RT ESY. ae\ninsoge cas dey ANN eee (Ct, We Gl iat OETA SQUIRE WH\nURES af 2d BRP er oe, Rb Os oar cea ORC RNa oe 4 RS ml RUS WE persetige pie iz.8 SN Ey CN I oat IG cars\nBee em aoe es NEAR te NAPE IRS ee Salem OWN aN Re\nee, OY KK oy a Vato SULA RGN eA Se) GE eT\neal Sau Le Kaa, 4 aes el at\nSo Coes Oo eee ae, En ED eee AV ssp y i a sena e Peterr oe Seo ea Seot Reais aeal as\nee ee SS\nHow NNSA moves nuclear weapons and materials\nNNSA‘s Office of Secure Transportation (OST) is responsible for the safe and secure transport of U.S. nuclear weapons,\ncomponents, and special nuclear materials such as enriched uranium and plutonium in the contiguous United States.
