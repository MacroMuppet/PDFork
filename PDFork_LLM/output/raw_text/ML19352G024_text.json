The proposed LAR will be submitted to \nthe NRC for prior review and approval in the second quarter of 2020. This code validation \nestablishes the area of interest for the American Centrifuge Operating, LLC (ACO) HALED \nprocess and evaluates benchmark experiments such that code system bias, bias uncertainty, and an \nupper subcritical limit can be established. This validation also provides the justification for using \na minimum margin of subcriticality of 0.02 for the American Centrifuge Plant Upper Subcritical \nLimit determination. \nAfter the NRC staff has had an opportunity to review the enclosed report, ACO is available to \nsupport a discussion with the NRC to address questions or clarify issues. \nThe enclosure contains Proprietary Information and in accordance with the guidance provided by \nthe U.S. Department of Energy, also contains Official Use Only information.
