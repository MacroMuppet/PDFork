Uranium exploration is undertaken by\nmany companies, often going over areas that were mined in the\n1950s-80s.\nMost US uranium-producing states are 'agreement states’ vis a vis\nthe Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) and have authority to\nissue permits and regulate uranium mining and milling. The NRC's\nrole is then minimal. In February 2015 Wyoming, the major uranium\nproduction state, passed legislation to make it an agreement state,\nalong with all the other uranium-producing states. The NRC agreed\nto this in 2018. Five of the six operating uranium recovery facilities\npreviously under NRC oversight are in Wyoming. Under a 2010\nagreement the NRC collaborates with the federal Bureau of Land\nManagement (BLM) on environmental assessment of mine\nproposals. A majority of US uranium production comes from\nWyoming's Powder River Basin.\nHowever, land access is partly controlled by the US government,\nand in 2011 the Interior Secretary issued an order banning new\nhardrock uranium mining in about 4000 square km of land in\nArizona for 20 years, which sterilized 145,000 tU of known\nresources according to the Nuclear Energy Institute (NEI) and also\nmuch prospective ground. The industry contends that uranium\nexploration and mining here would not compromise the Grand\nCanyon watershed. The land is not within the Grand Canyon\nNational Park or the buffer zone protecting the national park. The\nindustry contends that that the land withdrawal is not justified by\ninformation in the Interior Department's environmental assessmeni,\nand is an “arbitrary agency action” under the Administrative vac Tens\n\nhitps:/world-nuclear.org/information-library/country-profiles/countries-t-z/us-uranium-mining 1128\n\n213/25, 4:28 AM ‘US Uranium Mining and Exploration - World Nuclear Association\nProcedure Act, and that it fails to comply with the National\nEnvironmental Policy Act by failing to take the “hard look” at the\nwithdrawal’s consequences that the US Supreme Court required in\na unanimous 1989 decision. In March 2013 a US District Court\njudge declined to overturn the mining ban, and in October 2014 the\nUS District Court affirmed the ban (see Nuclear Energy Institute\ncomment}. This was then appealed, and in December 2017 the US\nCourt of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit upheld the earlier decisions.\nIn January 2015 the Environment Protection Agency (EPA)\nproposed new health and environmental protection standards for\nuranium extraction including tighter groundwater quality and\nmonitoring standards, under the Uranium Mill Tailings Radiation\nControl Act of 1978. The proposed standards address the increased\nuse of ISL for uranium recovery in the USA. The proposed rule\ndescribes how ISL facilities are to characterize groundwater\nchemistry before commencing uranium mining. The rule would also\nrequire compliance with whichever standard is most stringent from\nthe Safe Drinking Water Act, the Resource Conservation and\nRecovery Act, or the Uranium Mill Tailings Radiation Control Act for\neach of 13 groundwater constituents: arsenic, barium, cadmium,\nchromium, lead, mercury, selenium, silver, nitrate, molybdenum,\nradium, total uranium, and gross alpha particle activity. The final\npost-mining water quality would need to match the original, and be\nmonitored for 30 years by the operator unless chemistry was\nsatisfactory and stable over three years. The final standards will be\nadministered by the NRC.\n\nUS Uranium Production, tonnes U\nISL\noperations,\n\nCompany poe rock | 2023 | 2044 | 2015 2016 2017 2018\nmill\n\nCameco Ranch - ais | 556 358 118 0\nHighland,\nwy\n\n= fee PE EF\nButte, NE\nWillow\n\nUr-Energy Lost Creek, | 51 211 =| 280 216 98 110\nWY drummed drummed | drummed | drurr\n\nhitps:/world-nuclear.org/information-library/country-profiles/countries-t-z/us-uranium-mining 2129\n\n213/25, 4:28 AM ‘US Uranium Mining and Exploration - World Nuclear Association\nISL\noperations,\nCompany hard rock | 2023 | 2024 | 2015 2016 2017 2018\nmill\n01 (207 (102 (116\ncaptured) captured) | captured) | captr\n.

This is the first uranium-bearing calcrete identified in\nthe USA {cf. Australia and Namibia) and it is relatively shallow.\nEnergy Fuels — EFRC\nEnergy Fuels Resources Corporation (EFRC, a Colorado-based\nsubsidiary of Energy Fuels Inc of Toronto) is the largest US uranium\nmining company (after Cameco). In Apri] 2012 EFRC agreed to take\nover all Denison Mines! US assets and operations, including the\nWhite Mesa mill, in a C$106 million merger. In August 2013 Energy\nFuels took over Strathmore Minerals in a C$29 million deal. Korea\nElectric Power Co. (KEPCO) was the largest shareholder in both\ncompanies. It supported the takeovers and held 9.6% of the\nexpanded EFRC company (as well as retaining equity in Denison).\nKEPCO's long-term offtake agreement with Denison Mines was\nassigned to EFRC as part of the June 2012 takeover of Denison’s\nUS assets. In December 2013 EFRC entered into a strategic\nrelationship with KEPCO as its largest shareholder, focused on\ndevelopment of the Wyoming projects and uranium supply. At the\nend of 2016 KEPCO equity in EFRC was transferred to KHNP\nCanada Energy Ltd.\n\nIn June 2015 EFRC completed its $150 million takeover of Uranerz\n\nEnergy Corp. Its takeover of Mestena Uranium was finalised in mid-\n2016.\n\nte ery a FEN hia\nice ree EE A EN\npera SN TE TES = ae We\n\ni Re = 2 i RS | Gy fal Hea RR NENY uh\nes a Reig: ea can ACW AE\nSees ee AEN MR a TV) phot AO\n\nhitps:#/world-nuclear.orginformation-library/country-profiles/countries-t-z/us-uranium-mining 4129\n\n213/25, 4:28 AM ‘US Uranium Mining and Exploration - World Nuclear Association\nWhite Mesa Mill (Energy Fuels)\nEFRC claims a licensed capacity of over 4400 tU per year, and says\nit has the capability — with improved uranium prices and the receipt\nof additional permits - to produce about half of that on a sustained\nbasis. However, in 2016 it produced 129 tU from Nichols Ranch\nand 262 tU through the White Mesa mill, including 164 tU from the\nPinenut project. In 2017 it produced 100 tU from Nichols Ranch and\n504 tU through White Mesa.\nEFRC has a number of mines in Utah and Colorado that contain\nsubstantial high-grade vanadium resources, including the\nWhirlwind Mine and the La Sal Complex straddling the Utah-\nColorado border about 120 km north of White Mesa, and where it\nhas received government approvals for an expansion.\nUranerz Energy Corp, which became part of Energy Fuels in mid-\n2015, received an NRC materials licence for its Nichols Ranch ISL\noperation in the Powder River Basin of Wyoming in July 2011, and\nits final state approval in October 2012. Production commenced in\nApril 2014, with loaded resin being trucked to Cameco’s Smith\nRanch plant for recovery, under a toll processing agreement. The\ninitial plant capacity is 300 tU/yr. EFRC built its own elution plant,\nwhich was commissioned and licensed early in 2016.\nEFRC has NI 43-101 compliant resources of 6060 tU at about 0.1%\nU in seven Uranerz deposits, including measured and indicated\nresources of 1137 tU for Nichols Ranch itself, 860 tU for Hank, and\n1100 tU for West North-Butte. The company added the contiguous\nJane Dough permit area, with 1052 tU, to the Nichols Ranch project,\nand this was fully permitted by the NRC in March 2017. It will be\nfollowed by Hank as a satellite operation, and the BLM issued\napproval for this in mid-2015. The Uranerz North Reno Creek\nproperty east of Nichols Ranch was sold by EFRC to UEC in 2017\nfor $5.4 million, with 1650 tU measured and indicated resources at\n0.048 %U grade.\nEFRC’s main pending development projects in 2015 were Sheep\nMountain WY, Roca Honda NM, and Bullfrog in the Henry\nMountains complex of Utah. Other EFRC mines would \"remain on\nstandby until [market] conditions improve.” However, in 2016\nCanyon mine (now Pinyon Plain mine) in Arizona was being\npromoted as an early prospective start-up — see below.\nThe White Mesa mill in southeastern Utah (near 'Four Corners’), had\nbeen operated by Denison Mines for its own and purchased ore {the\n\nhitps:/world-nuclear.org/information-library/country-profiles/countries-t-z/us-uranium-mining 5/29\n\n213/25, 4:28 AM ‘US Uranium Mining and Exploration - World Nuclear Association\ncompany advertised its ore-buying programme), as well as doing\nsome toll milling. The mill was built in 1980 and refurbished in\n2007, with versatile licensed capacity of about 3000 tU/yr. It has\nproduced over 17,000 tU from 125 different mines and over 20,000\nt vanadium to 2019, with two types of feed: from Colorado Plateau,\ncarnotite in sandstone; and from Arizona Strip breccia pipes, fine\ngrain urananite, It has an alternate feed circuit to process “other\nuranium-bearing materials, such as remediation wastes and those\nderived from uranium conversion and other metal processing,”\nwhich may be very high grade. Treatment of these may be\nseparate, or blended in the primary leach circuit, and it has\nrecovered over 550 tU from such sources since 2005. In addition it\ncalcines UO, from Nichols Ranch. Some ore is hauled over 1000 km\nto the mill.\n\nWhite Mesa also has a vanadium co-product recovery circuit,\nunused since 2013, but recommissioned and which restarted\nproduction in 2019. In the short term, EFRC expects to produce\nabout 100 tonnes of vanadium pentoxide (V205) per month from\nuranium tailings from the La Sal mines. Beyond that, vanadium has\npotential as co-product from the company’s La Sal complex and\nWhirlwind mines on the Utah-Colorado border.\nWhite Mesa produced 21% of US uranium over 2011-15. It\nproduced 476 tU over 15 months to the end of 2013, with 700 t of\nvanadium oxide.* Some of its feed in 2013 came from Cameco’s\nBlind River tailings in Ontario, Production in 2014 was 362 tU, and\n114 tU in 2015, of which 28 tonnes was toll processed for a third\nparty. The company closed the mill in late 2015 on account of\nmarket conditions, while stockpiling feed to meet sales\ncommitments in 2016. Production of 262 tU in 2016 was expected\nto come from stockpiled Pinenut ore (177 tU}, stockpiled alternate\nfeed materials (64 tU) and recovery from tailings pond returns (10\ntU). Production in 2017 was 138.5 tU from EFRC's existing tailings\nthere and 365.5 tU from alternate feed materials on a toll\nprocessing basis, total 504 tU which is 54% of the US total for the\nyear.\n* During 2013 the White Mesa mill processed 18,370 t of Arizona 1 ore,\n2,052 t of Pinenut ore, 11,181 t of Daneros ore, 41,782 t of Pandora ore,\n40,669 tons of Beaver ore, and 8,894 t of purchased ore to produce 388 tU.\nIn 2020 EFRC arranged to import about 2000 tonnes of uranium-\nbearing material from Silmet, a rare earths processing plant in\nEstonia, for White Mesa. The material is tailings from tantalum-\nhitps:/world-nuclear.org/information-library/country-profiles/countries-t-z/us-uranium-mining 6/29\n\n213/25, 4:28 AM US Uranium Mining and Exploration - World Nuclear Association\nniobium recovery, with uranium grade equivalent to US high-grade\nores. In March 2020, EFRC joined Canadian-based Neo\nPerformance Materials to launch a US-European rare earth\nelements (REE) initiative to produce value-added REE products\nfrom natural monazite sands, a by-product of heavy mineral sands\nmined in southeastern USA, especially Georgia. In March 2021\nEFRC commenced production of a mixed rare earth carbonate\nextracted from natural monazite sands at the White Mesa mill. A\nportion of this REE carbonate production is shipped to Neo's REE\nseparations facility in Sillamae, Estonia (Silmet). Neo then\nprocesses the REE carbonate into separated REE materials for use\nin permanent magnets and other REE-based advanced materials.\nEFRC retains the uranium recovered from the monazite sands. It is\naiming to source 15,000 tonnes of monazite per year, which would\nutilize 2% of White Mesa’s capacity and supply half of US demand\nfor REE. US monazite contains about 55% REE, and about 22% of\nthis is neodymium and praseodymium (light REE) and 8% heavy\nREE including dysprosium and terbium.\n\nEFRC has several mines in the Uravan Mineral Belt on the Colorado\nPlateau (straddling the Utah-Colorado border) containing 2100 tU\nin placer deposits plus vanadium co-product (Uravan = uranium +\nvanadium). These La Sal Complex mines about 100 km northeast of\nthe White Mesa mill comprise La Sal, Beaver and Pandora which\nare mature operating mines with extensive interconnected\nunderground workings. The Rim mine is also here. In October 2012\nEFRC said it would place Beaver and La Sal on standby, pending\nuranium market improvement and would finish mining at Pandora\nby mid-year due to depleted resources. EFRC’s nearby Energy\nQueen mine in Utah was refurbished for 2008 reopening, and is\nlicensed but not operating. EFRC is investigating whether to\nselectively target high-grade vanadium for mining in the La Sal\ncomplex.\n\nEFRC'’s Henry Mountains deposits in Utah including Tony M,\nSouthwest and Bullfrog have 4900 tU as indicated resources at\nover 0.2% and inferred resources of 3100 tU, both NI 43-101\ncompliant. All these are some 120 km west of the White Mesa mill.\nDenison began production from the Tony M mine in 2007, but late\nin 2008 put it on care and maintenance. The company was\nintending to spend $35 million on the adjacent new Bullfrog mine,\nbut it was put on hold in 2008.\n\nEFRC’s Daneros mine in southeastern Utah was was the main\nasset of White Canyon Uranium which Denison bought for $57\n\nhitps:/world-nuclear.org/information-library/country-profiles/countries-t-z/us-uranium-mining 7129\n\n213/25, 4:28 AM ‘US Uranium Mining and Exploration - World Nuclear Association\nmillion in 2011. It has been mined since December 2009 and ore\nwas trucked 100 km to the White Mesa mill for treatment and\nrecovery of UsOe product. Ore produced during the development\nphase was sold to Denison, and from there a three-year toll\ntreatment agreement came into effect. JORC-compliant resource\nfigures of 447 tU in 0.22%U ore were quoted in August 2010, and\nproduction is planned to be 227 tU/yr. In October 2012 EFRC put\nDaneros on standby, pending uranium market improvement.\n\nIn 2021 Vancouver-based Consolidated Uranium bought the\nDaneros mine, along with Tony M, Rim, and some Colorado\nproperties. All are close to the White Mesa mill which will treat ore\non a toll basis. As part of the purchase deal, EFRC acquired a\n19.9% stake in Consolidated Uranium. In June 2023 work began to\nreopen the Tony M mine in the light of strong market conditions.\nDenison also had four old mines in the Arizona Strip of north central\nArizona, along with some new deposits there, though all these are\nsome 500 km southwest from the White Mesa mill and some may\nbe impacted by the Bureau of Land Management decision to stall\ndevelopments near the Grand Canyon. The Arizona One\nunderground mine resumed production in 2009, but known\nresources were depleted early in 2014, so it closed. Denison had\napplied for licences for its nearby Pinenut and EZ mines. Pinenut\nwas mined in the 1980s and produced 200 tU then, with a shaft\n410 m deep. EFRC brought the mine into production in 2013 but\nclosed it in mid-2015 pending uranium price improvemeni. Ore from\nboth mines was milled at White Mesa, as will be for that from\nPinyon Plain/Canyon.\n\nIn Arizona, the Pinyon Plain mine, formerly Canyon mine, which\nwas originally licensed in 1986 and fully permitted, has 936 tU as\nmeasured and indicated resources at 0.75%U (NI 43-101\ncompliant), with 5400 t copper at average grade 4.93%, increased\nby drilling undertaken into 2017. The development was on hold\npending resolution of a dispute with the US Forest Service, and\nthen pending an aquifer protection permit from Arizona\nDepartment of Environmental Quality. The surface facilities are\ncomplete along with shaft sinking to 443 metres. Ore will be\ntrucked to the White Mesa mill. The mine is now prospectively\nEFRC’'s prime producer. Copper is a likely significant co-product,\nand metallurgical tests to optimize its recovery continued into\n2018. Canyon will be the ninth breccia pipe deposit mined for |\nuranium.\n\nhitps:/world-nuclear.org/information-library/country-profiles/countries-t-z/us-uranium-mining 8/29\n\n213/25, 4:28 AM US Uranium Mining and Exploration - World Nuclear Association\nIn 2015 EFRC subsidiary EFR Arizona Strip acquired the Wate\ndeposit from Vane Minerals and Anfield Resources. It is a high-\ngrade breccia pipe deposit like Pinenut, Pinyon Plain/Canyon and\nArizona One mines. The company expected a mining licence by\nmid-2017 and anticipates processing production from Wate at its\nWhite Mesa mill. The deposit has 432 tU at an average grade of\n0.67%U (NI 43-101 compliant) inferred resources. Also in Arizona,\nthe EZ mine is subject to land use restrictions by the Bureau of Land\nManagement (BLM). It has 810 tU as inferred resources.\nEFRC's Sheep Mountain, Wyoming deposit has 11,700 tU\nmeasured and indicated resources at 0.1%U, including 7100\nprobable reserves. In 2009, Titan Uranium Inc bought Uranium\nOne's 50% interest in it, and it then transferred to EFRC in a 2012\nmerger with Titan. Underground development took place in the\n1970s. Titan undertook a prefeasibility study on mining the Congo\nopen pit and underground, with heap leaching recovery, to produce\n580 tU/yr. EFRC has updated this preliminary feasibility study for\nthe whole project, and proposed development was in conjunction\nwith Gas Hills, only 45 km north. The BLM was preparing an EIS for\nthe project, with approval expected in mid-2016. The state mine\npermit for major expansion was issued in July 2015.\nStrathmore had been working towards bringing its Gas Hills\nproperties in central Wyoming into production, possibly in\nconjunction with Juniper Ridge, or with EFRC’s Sheep Mountain\nnearby, or both. In mid-2017 these two deposits were acquired by\nURZ Energy Corp.\nIn New Mexico, Strathmore submitted a mining permit application in\nOctober 2009 for Roca Honda (then 60%-owned, with Sumitomo\n40%) in the Grants mineral district. Original plans assumed that a\nnew mill would be built, but the White Mesa mill about 180 km\naway in southeastern Utah is likely to be used. In June 2015 EFRC\nbought URI's partly-developed Roca Honda mineral properties\nadjacent to EFRC’s (ex Strathmore) Roca Honda and then in 2016\nbought out Sumitomo’s 40% share for $6.3 million, giving it full\nownership. The company hopes to complete permitting in 2017 and\nhas signed an agreement to buy Sumitomo's 40% share, giving it\nfull ownership. Total measured and indicated resources are 6500 tU\ngrading 0.41%U and inferred resources of 4300 tU grading 0.40%U\n(Feb 2016). Production potential is about 1100 tU/yr over nine\nyears. The company hopes to complete permitting in 2017.\nThe merged company also has other projects in the Grants mineral |\ndistrict of New Mexico, including: Marquez with 3500 iU as\n\nhitps:/world-nuclear.org/information-library/country-profiles/countries-t-z/us-uranium-mining 9/29\n\n213/25, 4:28 AM US Uranium Mining and Exploration - World Nuclear Association\nindicated resource, Dalton Pass with ISL potential and 1000 tU\nmeasured & indicated resource, and Nose Rock, deep in hard rock\nwith 1160 tU measured & indicated resource, All these are NI 43-\n101 compliant. In November 2015 EFRC sold Marquez, Nose Rock\nand other small deposits in Arizona and Utah to Vancouver-based\nenCore Energy Corp.\n\nOther EFRC Uravan mines operating in 2007-08 but then closed\ninclude Topaz, West Sunday and Sunday/St. Jude in the Sunday\ncomplex in Colorado. There are no plans to bring the other mine\nthere, Van 4, into production. EFRC reopened the refurbished\nWhirlwind mine {including Packrat and Bonanza) following Bureau\nof Land Management and state approval, but put it on standby in\n2009. It had 425 tU measured and indicated resources and 770 tU\ninferred resources. These properties were sold to Western Uranium\n& Vanadium Corp in 2014.\nEFRC in March 2011 had received a Colorado state licence to build\nthe new 330 tU/yr Pinon Ridge mill for ore from its northern Arizona\nmines, plus possible toll treatment, but this was overturned on\nappeal in June 2012, pending a further public hearing. The state’s\nradioactive materials licence was reissued in April 2013, but plans\nwere then put on hold, with the licence held in abeyance from 2014,\nand the project was sold to Western Uranium Corp. The company\nhad been seeking $140 million finance for the mill, which would\nalso produce 1700 t/yr of vanadium oxide.\nIn June 2016 EFRC took over Mestena Uranium LLC, a private Texas\ncompany. Its Alta Mesa ISL plant in southern Texas was operating\nto the end of 2013 but is now on standby. It has about 385 tU/yr\ncapacity and is understood to be a low-cost producer which could\nbe brought on line as a third production centre for EFRC within six\nmonths. EFRC announced NI 43-101 compliant measured and\nindicated resources of 1390 tU and inferred resources of 6460 tU.\nProduction commenced at Pinyon Plain, La Sal and Pandora mines\nin December 2023 in the light of strong market conditions.\nWestern Uranium & Vanadium Corp.\nIn July 2014 Western Uranium Corp (formerly Homeland Uranium;\nsince 2018 Western Uranium & Vanadium Corp) agreed to buy from\nEFRC some of its non-core assets including eight mining properties\nalong the Colorado-Utah border and the licence for the Pinon Ridge\nmill (see above) for $33 million. The former comprise the fully-\nhitps:/world-nuclear.org/information-library/country-profiles/countries-t-z/us-uranium-mining 10/29\n\n213/25, 4:28 AM ‘US Uranium Mining and Exploration - World Nuclear Association\npermitted Sunday complex, the Sage and Van 4 mines, the Wilhunt,\nSan Rafael, Farmer Girl, Dun and the Yellow Cat projects. EFRC will\nget a royalty of $3 per tonne on Pinion Ridge mill throughput, and\none percent of sales. The mill was then held by Pinon Ridge\nResources Corporation (PRRC), associated with Western Uranium,\nbut in April 2018 the state revoked the licence. PRRC was reported\nto be deciding whether to appeal this or to apply for a new licence.\nIn November 2019 the Colorado Court of Appeals ordered the Van\nAmine, inactive since 1989, to be closed and directed the company,\nPinon Ridge Mining LLC, a Western Uranium subsidiary, to comply\nwith reclamation requirements. Other 'zombie' mines inactive for\nmore than a decade may be subject to similar orders.\n\nIn mid-2015 Western Uranium & Vanadium announced NI 43-101\ncompliant measured and indicated resources of 390 tU at 0.21%U\nand 735 tU inferred resources at 0.31%U for the Sunday mine\ncomplex covering the southern third of the Uravan mineral belt in\nColorado. In June 2019 the company launched the Sunday Mine\nComplex Vanadium Project with the opening of the Sunday and St\nJude mine portals to focus on high-grade vanadium ore, averaging\n3.15%. When previously mined from 2007 to 2009 it yielded a 6:1\nratio of vanadium to uranium. In mid-2021 the company resumed\nmining activities at the Sunday complex and moved the project's\noperations base from the St Jude to the Sunday mine. Underground\ndrifting to access the GMG orebody (part of the Sunday complex}\ncommenced late in 2021.\n\nIn 2015 Western Uranium Corp took over Black Range Minerals Ltd\nin a $14.5 million transaction, making it a subsidiary and acquiring\nthe 11,500 tU Hansen and Taylor Ranch deposits in Colorado with\n15,200 tU measured and indicated resources grading 0.053%U.\nIncluding inferred resources, the whole project has 35,000 tU\ngrading 0.05%U. Hansen was licensed for mining in 1981, but\nstalled due to low uranium prices.\n\nIn mid-2019 the company reported 'historic' resources of about\n27,000 tU, mostly at Hansen and Taylor Ranch, and 13,500 t\nvanadiurn grading 1.4-2.2%.\n\nBlack Range has a joint venture with Ablation Technologies LLC to\ncommercialize its ablation mining technology (AMT), an ore\nbeneficiation process. This is applicable to sandstone deposits\nwhere the uranium and vanadium occur as a patina around sand\ngrains. It uses kinetic energy to abrade particles against one\nanother without any chemicals, to detach the uranium and\nvanadium minerals. The resulting fine material is relatively high-\n\nhitps:/world-nuclear.org/information-library/country-profiles/countries-t-z/us-uranium-mining 11128\n\n213/25, 4:28 AM ‘US Uranium Mining and Exploration - World Nuclear Association\ngrade beneficiated ore comprising 85-95% of the uranium and\nvanadium in 10-20% of the original mass.\nThis 2015 JV agreement allows Western Uranium to utilize this\ntechnology at the Hansen-Taylor Ranch Project and at other\nprojects. The merger terms with Western require Black Range to\nmove an ablation pilot plant to its Sunday mine underground\ncomplex in southwest Colorado, bought from EFRC in 2014. A 5 t/h\nablation unit is operating there, and a 20 t/h commercial-scale one\nwas to join it by mid-2016. The company said: “Production tests\nindicate that the patented mining process could substantially\nreduce the cost of producing uranium concentrates from both the\ncompany’s mines, and potentially from other sandstone hosted\ndeposits globally.”\nIn late 2016 Western Mining signed an agreement with Pinon\nRidge Corporation to use ablation technology at its subsidiary’s mill.\nThe technology is being evaluated by the Colorado Department of\nPublic Health and the Environment (CDPHE) with advice from the\nNRC.\nIn October 2024 Western Uranium & Vanadium Corp acquired\nPinon Ridge Corporation.\nUranium One\nToronto-based Uranium One's main interests are in ISL projects.\nUranium One is wholly-owned by Russia’s ARMZ, and Uranium\nOne Holdings is responsible for all Rosatom’s uranium mining\noutside Russia. US operations have current design capacity of 500\ntU/yr and maximum potential of 1400 tU/yr. All are ISL. In November\n2021 Texas-based Uranium Energy Corp agreed to buy Uranium\nOne Americas from the Russian parent company. The total\npurchase price comprises $112 million in cash and the replacement\nof $19 million in reclamation bonds.\nIn Wyoming, Uranium One USA had production from its Willow\nCreek ISL project in the Powder River Basin from 2011 to 9 July\n2018. The project comprises several small mines and the Irigaray\nmill, mostly acquired from Areva in 2009 for $35 million. In\nDecember 2010, the NRC licensed the Irigaray mill to produce up to\n960 tUsyr (it operated at 500 tU/yr in 2011), and for nearby\nChristensen Ranch to restart operations (it had been shut down\nsince 2000 and restarted in January 2011).

Overall Willow Creek produced 362 tU\nin 2013 at a cost of $36/lb and 217 tU in 2014. Wellfield\ndevelopment was put on hold in 2014 until prices improve, and\nproduction wound down in 2015, continuing at a low level and with\nonly 9 tU produced in the first half of 2018. Willow Creek total\nresources (NI 43-101) are 6500 tU. The Irigaray plant also toll\nprocesses loaded resin from Peninsula’s Lance project on the east\nside of Powder River basin, pending construction of a plant\nthere, and in December 2016 it signed an agreement to toll process\nAnfield’s loaded resin also, to produce about 193 tU. In January\n2024 UEC decided to restart production at Christensen Ranch.\nThe Nuclear Regulatory Commission issued a licence to Uranium\nOne Americas for Moore Ranch in October 2010, to start production\nin 2012, but development is suspended. Uranium One’s additional\nprojects in the Powder River Basin, including Ludeman, Allemand-\nRoss, Barge (1770 tU}, Pine Tree and Ross Flats could also be\ndeveloped as satellite operations with final processing through the\nIrigaray central plant. Uranium One has some 4000 tU as measured\nresources (2235 t at Moore Ranch) and 23,000 tU as indicated\nresources in the state. Ludeman is quoted with 4200 tU total\nresources (NI 43-101) and is to be an extension of the Willow Creek\nproject. It also had plans for production from Antelope and JAB in\nthe Great Divide Basin, but these were deferred due to endangered\nspecies concerns.\nUranium One deposits in the Great Divide Basin of Wyoming are\nAntelope, JAB, Twin Buites, Crooks Creek, Bull Springs, Stewart\nCreek, Cyclone Rim and West JAB.\nIn 2016 Uranium One sold 24 Wyoming properties in the Black\nHills, Powder River Basin, Great Divide Basin, Laramie Basin,\nShirley Basin and Wind River Basin areas to Anfield Resources for\n$6.55 million.\nIn 2010, Uranium One sold a number of Utah and Colorado claims\nand two Utah leases, including the Sage mine, to Colorado Plateau\nPartners (CPP}, a joint venture between Energy Fuels Inc of Toronto\n{see EFRC above) and Royal Resources Ltd of Australia.\nUEC\nUranium Energy Corporation (UEC} in November 2021 agreed to |\nbuy Uranium One Americas from the Russian parent company.

UEC then made Hobson the basis and hub of its Texas\nuranium projects. Hobson had 385 t/yr capacity, but UEC says it is\nnow 1150 tU/yr, in 2011-12 it processed 90 tU. It recovers uranium\nfrom loaded resin trucked there from the Palangana ISL mine, to\nwhich will be added loaded resin from satellite plants at Goliad and\nBurke Hollow, followed by Nichols and Salvo.\nProduction commenced at Palangana in November 2010 — the first\nUS ISL operation to start in five years, but there has been no\nproduction since 2015. By the end of 2011 UEC had obtained all\nthe necessary permits to develop its Goliad ISL project, 70 km east\nof the Hobson mill, for production anticipated from mid2014.\nPalangana has 410 tU measured and indicated resources grading\n0.114%U in two orebodies and 445 tU inferred resources at\n0.15%U in six others, while Goliad has 2100 tU measured &\nindicated resources at 0.04%U, all NI 43-101 compliant.\nFuture ISL satellites are Burke Hollow, 86 km southeast of Hobson\nand with 2700 tU inferred resource estimate, Salvo, with 1100 tU\ninferred resource grading 0.07%U, then Nichols with 500 tU\ninferred located close to Hobson mill, and Longhorn. Salvo and\nLonghorn are 70-85 km from Hobson and will feed the Hobson mill.\nUEC claims cash cost of $20 per pound over 2010-12 for its ISL\nproduction, excluding royalties. However, in September 2013 UEC\nsaid it would slow production at Palangana pending recovery in\nuranium prices, while it focuses on Goliard and Burke Hollow. UEC\nlodged final permit applications for Burke Hollow late in 2014, and\nsome permits were issued in May and July 2015, December 2016\nand February 2019.\nUEC’s Anderson project northwest of Phoenix in central west\nArizona was formerly mined in 1950s to yield 12,800 tU. It has\n6000 tU indicated and 960 tU inferred resources at 0.024%U\naccessible by open pit mining, with two-thirds as much again\n{mostly inferred) accessible underground (NI 43-101). UEC expects\nto produce 6200 tU over 14 years using heap leach and transport\nof loaded resin to White Mesa mill in Utah. |\n\nhitps:/world-nuclear.org/information-library/country-profiles/countries-t-z/us-uranium-mining 14/29\n\n213/25, 4:28 AM ‘US Uranium Mining and Exploration - World Nuclear Association\nIn 2007 UEC bought the New River, now Los Cuatros Uranium\nProject in central Arizona with a historic resource estimate of 5000\ntU in shallow low-grade ore. Its Workman Creek deposit there has\n2100 tU inferred resource at 0.073%U.\nUEC has a NI 43-101 inferred resource for its Slick Rock project in\nwestern Colorado, of 4470 tU grading 0.19%U. Vanadium is also\npresent. Several other prospects are nearby.\nUEC acquired 97% of the fully-permitted Reno Creek in Wyoming's\nPowder River Basin from Pacific Road Resources Funds and the\nbalance from the AUC subsidiary of Bayswater Uranium\nCorporation of Canada, which had a positive pre-feasibility study\non mining its Reno Creek and Southwest Reno Creek deposits in\nWyoming, held by its affiliate AUC. They have a NI 43-104\nmeasured and indicated resource of 10,000 tU @ 0.035%U {Jan\n2019) suitable for ISL, plus a small inferred resource. The project\nwould have up to 18 wellfields and a central processing plant\nproducing 330 tU/yr initially then up to 770 tUsyr as the market\npermits, and would take 18 months to bring online. EFRC’s North\nReno Creek property was sold to UEC in 2017, adding 1650 tU\nmeasured and indicated resources at 0.048 %U grade and\nconsolidating the holdings. Reno Creek is 30 km southeast of\nUranium One's Willow Creek, 50 km north of Cameco’s Smith\nRanch, and 130 km northeast of Casper. UEC says that North and\nSouthwest Reno Creek can now be developed together.\nIn July 2015 the Wyoming Department of Environmental Quality\n{WDEQ) Land Quality Division issued AUC a permit to mine for the\nReno Creek uranium project, producing up to 770 tU per year. In\nFebruary 2017 the NRC issued an operating licence for the project\nat this production level, though AUC said it did not intend to\nproceed immediately.\nCameco\nCameco's US subsidiary Cameco Resources Inc operates the Smith\nRanch-Highland mine in Wyoming's Powder River Basin and the\nCrow Butte mine in Nebraska, both of them ISL operations, and\nproducing nearly 1200 tonnes U between them in 2009. The\ncompany is aiming to increase production from these mines and\nadjacent properties including Reynolds Ranch to 1770 tU/yr when\nmarkets improve.

Practically no production has\ntaken place since 2017.\n\nSmith Ranch-Highland produced 815 tU in 2014, including North\nButte, and has declined from that level since. North Butte-Brown\nRanch is a satellite plant about 40 km north which started\nproduction in May 2013 in the same Powder River Basin and able\nto ramp up to 270 tU/yr. Licensed wellfield capacity of the whole\noperation is 1156 tU. Reserves total 3080 tU, plus 11,000 tU\nmeasured and indicated resources (December 2015).\n\nCameco also has the Gas Hills-Peach project 90 km west of Casper\nin Wyoming which is permitted but on hold, with 5100 tU measured\nand indicated resources.\n\nCrow Butte production has declined from 272 tU in 2013, though\nlicensed capacity is 770 tU.

It is in northwest Nebraska, near the borders of Wyoming\nand South Dakota.\n\nURI / Westwater Resources / enCore Energy\n\nUranium Resources Inc (URI) began operations in 1977 in south\nTexas. It developed and produced over 216 tU from the Longoria\nand Benavides projects in the early 1980s, then 2350 tU from\nKingsville Dome and Rosita through to 1999.\n\nIn south Texas, URI commenced production from its Vasquez ISL\nmine in 2004 at about 50 tU/yr and from Kingsville Dome in 2006.\nVasquez peaked in 2006 and is now depleted (30 tU in 2007, 9 tU\nin 2008). Rosita restarted production in 2008 with oxygen injection\nbut was then closed as uneconomic after 3 tU was recovered.\nKingsville Dome produced 67 tU in 2008 and 19 tU in 2009. It was\nclosed in June 2009 due to low uranium prices, and the wellfield has\nbeen remediated using reverse osmosis along with Vasquez and\nRosita wellfields. The 300 tU/yr Kingsville Dome plant is being\nmaintained on standby, with potential for accepting resin from four\nsatellite IX plants.\n\nURI earlier said that it did not intend to revive its Texas operations,\nwith total reserves at Kingsville and Rosita wellfields of only 260 tU.\nHowever, in December 2013 it said that it remained “committed to\ndeveloping uranium in south Texas as we aim to leverage our two\nprocessing plants in the region” — Kingsville Dome and Rosita.\n\nhitps:/world-nuclear.org/information-library/country-profiles/countries-t-z/us-uranium-mining 16/29\n\n213/25, 4:28 AM ‘US Uranium Mining and Exploration - World Nuclear Association\nButler Ranch, also ISL and acquired in 2014, is 160 km north of the\nKingsville Dome plant, and Rosita is 65 km northwest of the\nplant. In 2015 URI was actively evaluating Butler Ranch and Alta\nMesa Este. In 2021 enCore Energy was refurbishing the Rosita\nprocessing plant with a view to completion in mid-2022.\n\nURI owned several Grants mineral belt properties in western New\nMexico which hold 39,000 tU, and from which it hoped to produce\n2000-3000 tU/yr from ISL. URI subsidiary Hydro Resources Inc was\nlicensed in 1994 to mine the Crownpoint and Church Rock ISL\ndeposits in New Mexico, and after years of opposition the licence\nwas validated by the Nuclear Regulatory Commission in 2006 and\nthen reactivated in 2011. URI planned to produce 385 tU/yr from\nChurch Rock/Mancos from 2013, as the first of URI’s New Mexico\nproperties to develop, subject to further permitting.\n\nNose Rock, Roca Honda and West Largo/Ambrosia Lake are other\nURI properties in the Grants mineral belt. URI has a licence to build\na processing plant in the area.\n\nIn June 2015 URI sold its partly-developed Roca Honda mineral\nproperties adjacent to EFRC’s Roca Honda project to EFRC, while\nretaining some royalty rights. In partial exchange it received from\nEFRC some claims adjacent to its Church Rock prospect. These\nhave a historic resource estimate of 4200 tU based on a previous\nowner's 1979 data. URI has a licence to build a processing plant in\nthe area. Following the takeover of Anatolia Energy, in November\n2015 URI agreed to sell its Crownpoint and Church Rock properties\nto Laramide Resources for $12.5 million, and this was confirmed in\nApril 2016 by way of selling Hydro Resources Inc and finalized at\nthe end of the year.\n\nURI In 2007 URI sought to buy Rio Algom Mining, with uranium\nproperties and a licensed mill site at Ambrosia Lake in New Mexico,\nwhere it planned to construct a new mill to serve the Grants mineral\nbelt.

The projects were owned by its Turkish\nsubsidiary Adur Madencilik Limited Sirketi, which had held exclusive\nrights for the exploration and development of uranium there since\n2007 and had invested heavily in them. In December 2018\nWesiwater Resources (formerly URI) filed a request for arbitration\non the matter.\n\nIn August 2017 URI changed its name to Westwater Resources\n(WWR) \"to better reflect\" its business plan to initiate lithium\nproduction “while maintaining optionality in the case of a future\nrising uranium price.” In September 2020 the company announced\nthat it was selling its US uranium assets to enCore Energy for $1.95\nmillion, and the sale was completed in January 2021.\n\nEnCore Energy Corp (Vancouver) had bought Marquez and Nose\nRock, adding to its Crownpoint and Hosta Butta deposits in New\nMexico, and also other small deposits in Arizona and Utah from\nEFRC in November 2015. It plans to put Rosita in Texas back into\nproduction.\n\nIn September 2021 enCore Energy and Azarga Uranium Corp,\nannounced a merger.\n\nUr-Energy\n\nUr-Energy Inc {URE/URG) has total about 8500 tU as NI 43-101\nindicated resources in Wyoming, and claims potential for double\nthat. Lost Creek in the Great Divide basin has 5100 tU measured\nand indicated resources at 0.04 %U and 2480 tU inferred (Nov\n2015), including leases taken over from Uranium One in 2012. The\ncompany plans to produce 400 tU/yr from the Lost Creek wellfields\nand about the same from satellite operations through to 2031. The\nsite is close to Rio Tinto's Sweetwater mill.\n\nProduction from Lost Creek commenced in mid-2013 after\nconstruction of a 770 tU/yr mill, following NRC licensing and Bureau\nof Land Management approval.

(URZ's Shirley Basin property is separate.)\n\nUr-Energy reduced production levels from 2016 in response to a\n“persistently weak\" uranium market. In June 2023 Ur-Energy\nannounced the successful startup of production flow from header\nhouses 2-4 at Lost Creek.\nPeninsula / Strata\nAustralian-based Peninsula Energy commenced production from its\nLance ISL project on the east side of Wyoming's Powder River\nBasin early in 2016. It has JORC-compliant resources (December\n2017) of 20,700 tU at 0.04%U at Lance, including 6080 tU as\nmeasured and indicated resources, held by the company’s\nsubsidiary Strata Energy Inc. The company plans a three-stage\nramp-up eventually to 1150 tUAyr from three production units —\nRoss, Kendrick and Barber — which will delay much capital\nexpenditure and defer most sales until after 2018. These production\nunits will feed into a central processing plant with an expandable\ncapacity of up to 1154 tU per year (four modules of 288 tU/yr),\ncommencing from Ross. The plant incorporates a restoration circuit\nwith resin ion exchange (IX) then reverse osmosis (RO) to restore\nwater quality of barren liquor to pre-mining levels.\nA state permit to mine was issued in November 2012. From the\nNRC, the company received a source materials licence (SML), and a\nfinal supplemental environmental impact statement (SEIS) for both\nthe plant and Ross wellfield in March-April 2014. The NRC\nauthorised operation of the Ross wellfield in November 2015. Stage\n1 of production involves trucking loaded resin 90 km west to\nUranium One’s Irigaray plant for elution. Stage 2 will increase the\nion exchange capacity and bring the elution, precipitation, drying,\nand packaging processes in-house with the new central plant. The\nKendrick, Richards and Barber production units to the south of Ross\nwill be brought on line with amendments to Ross licences, the\nBarber wellfield and satellite plant being part of stage 3 ramp-up. A\ndeep disposal well has been drilled to 2600 metres to a sandstone\naquifer with low water quality.

The change would make it the only current ISL operation in\nthe USA with acid teach. Alkaline leaching continued pending\nlicence amendment. Field trials of acid leaching commenced in\nDecember 2018 and in November 2019 the state environment\ndepartment approved the change. The company said that its\nsurvival depended on the change.\nIn July 2015 Peninsula agreed to buy the nearby Hauber project\nfrom Aldershot Resources. This will likely become a satellite\noperation for Lance. Homestake produced 1000 tU in 1950-60s\nfrom Hauber, and in 2011 Bayswater Uranium was farming into the\nproject. Aldershot quotes only about 250 tU resources NI 43-101\ncompliant, but estimates 1400 tU.\nIn March 2016 Peninsula announced a long-term sales contract\nover 2020-30 for 1540 tU with a major European utility, with a\nprovision to increase this to half of the Lance project's production\nfrom 2026. It already has sales contracts for 3045 tU with US and\nEuropean utilities. Its first product was delivered in May 2016, and\n2016 production was 49 tU.\nUranium production was stopped at Lance in July 2019. In\nNovember 2022 Peninsula Energy decided to resume operations.\nProduction was initially expected in the first quarter of 2023, but\nlater delayed until the end of 2024.\nAzarga Uranium\nAzarga Uranium Corp {formerly Powertech Uranium Corp) is\nproposing to develop Dewey Burdock in South Dakota — very close\nto the Wyorning border.

And in the same\ngeology. It also has the JB project in the Uravan District, straddling\nthe Colorado and Utah border.\n\nIn 2018 Azarga merged with URZ Energy (formerly Summit Point\nUranium Corp), focused on Wyoming ISL prospects, notably\n\nthe Gas Hills and Juniper Ridge deposits and the Shirley\n\nBasin project all in Wyoming acquired in 2016 from EFRC (and\npreviously held by Strathmore). Gas Hills has 4140 tU at 0.077%U\nas measured and indicated resources, 72% of which are amenable\nto ISL, and Juniper Ridge 2315 tU at 0.05%U indicated (NI 43-101\ncompliant). Strathmore had been working towards bringing its Gas\nHills properties in central Wyoming into production. Uranium is in\nroll-front sandstone deposits, some amenable to ISL and some to\nopen pit mining. Juniper Ridge would be developed in conjunction\nwith Gas Hills, though it is 150 km south, straddling the Colorado\nborder, and had been mined intermittently from 1954 to 1966.\nEFRC envisaged open pit mining and heap leach.\n\nIn September 2021 enCore Energy and Azarga Uranium Corp\nannounced a merger.\n\nAnfield Energy\n\nVancouver-based Anfield Energy has 1780 tU at 0.25%U as\nmeasured and indicated resources at Velvet-Wood in Utah, the\nFrank M project in Utah, and a 50% interest in the Wate deposit in\nArizona (432 tU), with EFRC. In June 2016 it reported a preliminary\neconomic assessment of the licensed Velvet-Wood project using\nheap leach or vat leach methods with an average output of 243 tU\nper year, for a total production of 1770 tU over a seven-year mine\nlife. Under both scenarios, total capital expenditure is about $46\nmillion, with direct operating costs of around $11 per pound. Other\nconventional mining properties are in Colorado.\n\nAnfield’s ‘key asset’ is the 1000 t/day Shootaring Canyon mill in\nUtah, which it bought, with some small stockpiles there, from\nUranium One. Uranium One in 2007 had bought the mill* in\nsoutheast Utah with associated properties in four contiguous states\n\nhitps:/world-nuclear.org/information-library/country-profiles/countries-t-z/us-uranium-mining 21/28\n\n213/25, 4:28 AM ‘US Uranium Mining and Exploration - World Nuclear Association\nfor $50 million plus royalties, from US Energy. In October 2014 the\nUtah regulator agreed to transfer the licence to Anfield Resources\nand to give it a year to apply for licence renewal with necessary\nupgrading. This process was under way through to 2018, with\nconsideration of installing ¢ vanadium circuit for Velvet-Wood\nore. All Anfield’s conventional uranium properties are within 200 km\nof the Shootaring mill.\n* US Energy had been planning to bring the mill back into production at a cost\nof $31 million. It was built in 1980 and then closed in 1982 and put on care\nand maintenance. (Uranium One had also secured the right to buy Rio Tinto's\n3000 tdday Sweetwater uranium mill and associated uranium properties in\nsouth-central Wyoming for $110 million, but in January 2007 Rio Tinto\ncancelled the deal.) In October 2013 Uranium One agreed to sell the\nShootaring Canyon mill for $10 million to Black Range Minerals and also\nenter into a joint venture arrangement for all Uranium One's associated\n‘conventiona!' hard rock leases, where Black Range would progressively\nincrease its equity, but this deal lapsed due to regulatory problems. Black\nRange will concentrate on its Hansen project. In August 2014 Anfield\nResources agreed to buy the mill and associated mining properties in three\nstates, including Velvet-Wood in Utah, for $5 million.\nIn September 2016 Anfield completed the purchase of 24 Wyoming\nISL properties in the Black Hills, Powder River Basin, Great Divide\nBasin, Laramie Basin, Shirley Basin and Wind River Basin areas\nfrom Uranium One for $6.55 million. In March 2018 it agreed to\npurchase the Charlie project in the Pumpkin Buttes area of Powder\nRiver Basin from Cotter Corporation. NI 43-101 resource estimates\nfor these Wyoming properties are being prepared and progressively\npublished. Those for Red Rim, Clarkson Hill and Nine Mile had been\ncompleted by mid-2018, showing a total of 1405 tU indicated and\n1718 tU inferred resources.

There was little regulation or oversight of\nfacilities, and tailings were put in impoundments without liners,\ngiving rise to groundwater contamination.\nThere was a considerable legacy of pollution from hundreds of\nabandoned uranium mines and treatment plants, most\ngovernment-sponsored and dating from the 1950s. This problem\nwas addressed in the 1980s. For instance, the Uravan mill site on\nthe San Miguel River in Colorado was designated a Superfund site\nand was cleaned up between 1987 and 2007 at a cost of over\n$120 million. Historic mining and milling at Uravan included the\nproduction of radium, vanadium and uranium, leaving radioactive\nresidues from the early 1900s through to the mid-1980s. From the\ntime Uravan mill began operating in the 1920s until it was shut\ndown, it processed over ten million tonnes of uranium-vanadium\nore, giving rise to a similar amount of uncontained tailings, and\n1,440 megalitres of liquid wastes were treated in the site\nrehabilitation program.\nThe Schwartzwalder mine west of Denver, Colorado, was once the\nlargest underground uranium mine in USA. It has been polluting\nRalston Creek feeding the city's water supply and is now subject to\nbacterial bioremediation by Cotter Corp.\nIn 2015, the US Department of Justice announced that $13.2 million\nin federal funding will be placed into a trust to pay for evaluations\nof abandoned uranium mines across Navajo lands in Arizona, New\nhitps:/world-nuclear.org/information-library/country-profiles/countries-t-z/us-uranium-mining 27129\n\n213/25, 4:28 AM ‘US Uranium Mining and Exploration - World Nuclear Association\nMexico, and Utah. This will expedite the cleanup of 16 mines seen\nas the most significant hazards. The funding is part of an ongoing\nmulti-agency federal initiative to address legacy issues connected\nwith historic uranium mining across the Navajo Nation which\nproduced four million tonnes of uranium ore between 1944 and\n1986. According to the US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA),\nwebsite: “Nearly 30 million tons of uranium ore were extracted from\nNavajo lands under leases with the Navajo Nation” over this period.\nIn 2017 the NRC ordered Homestake Mining to undertake\ngroundwater remediation at the site of a mill which operated near\nGrants in New Mexico from 1958 to 1990. In 1975 it was\ndiscovered that seepage from 22 million tonnes of tailings in two\nimpoundments had contaminated groundwater aquifers, and a\ngroundwater protection plan was implemented from 1977. The site\nis also under the oversight of the US EPA through the Superfund\nprogramme. Homestake submitted a revised groundwater\nmonitoring programme to the NRC for this Grants Reclamation\nProject in August 2018.\n\nThe versatile White Mesa mill in Utah operated by EFRC is able to\n\nre-treat some of the mine residues and recover some uranium from\n\nthem to help clean up old mine sites.\n\nNotes & references\n\nReferences\n\n1.
