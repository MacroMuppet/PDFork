More recent research suggests some\nuranium is formed in the merger of neutron stars.\nUranium later became enriched in the continental crust.\nRadioactive decay contributes about half of the Earth's heat flux.\n\nGeologists and geochemists have been studying the abundance, distribution and\n\nchronometric potential of the isotopes of uranium for more than a century.

Where did the uranium now in the Earth come from?\n\n2. What effects has the comparatively trivial uranium content of the Earth had on the\nevolution of the planet and, conversely, are there feedbacks controlling the geochemical\ncycle of uranium that vary secularly (i.e. over long, indefinite periods of time)?\n\n3. Can we track through time the way uranium has been recycled through the exosphere,\ncrust and mantle of the Earth?\n\nCosmic abundance of elements\n\nFor many years, since the 1930s, a large number of scientists have been occupied with\n\ndetermining the abundances of the elements and their isotopes in the objects comprising\n\nthe solar system, and with accounting for the abundance patterns observed. In fact,\n\nspectroscopic measurements show that the abundances of elements in stars vary and that\n\nthere is no single applicable ‘cosmic abundance’ pattern.\n\nCloser to home, there are major differences in abundances of the elements in the various\n\nplanets that orbit our hydrogen-helium dominated Sun. The terrestrial planets, including\n\nthe Earth, are relatively depleted in the potentially gaseous or volatile elements (hydrogen,\n\nhelium, carbon and neon) and are dominated by elements of low and even atomic number\n\n(oxygen, magnesium, silicon and iron). On this scale, uranium — the abundance of which in\n\nthe Sun is only 10-!2 that of hydrogen — is an exceedingly rare element. Furthermore,\n\nmeasurements of oxygen isotopes in meteorites show that the solar system as a whole is\n\nnot homogeneous in terms of isotopic ratios. All these variations point to a conclusion that\n\nmultiple sources were involved in the production of proto-solar system material.\n\nWhere did uranium come from? [\nhttps://world-nuclear.org/information-library/nuclear-fuel-cycle/uranium-resources/the-casmic-origins-of-uranium 2n2\n\n2113/25, 4:33 AM The Cosmic Origins of Uranium - World Nuclear Association\n\nCosmochemists have been concerned not only with patterns and secular trends of\nabundance of the elements in galaxies but also with the origins of abundance anomalies in\nparticular stars and with theories on the synthesis of different nuclei to account for these\nobservations. According to these theories, the Earth's uranium was produced in one or\nmore supernovae (\"An explosive brightening of a star in which the energy radiated by it\nincreases by a factor of ten billion... A supernova explosion occurs when a star has burned\nup all its available nuclear fuel and the core collapses catastrophically.\" - Oxford Dictionary\nof Physics). The main process concerned was the rapid capture of neutrons on seed nuclei\nat rates greater than disintegration through radioactivity. The neutron fluxes required are\nbelieved to occur during the catastrophically explosive stellar events called supernovae.\nGravitational compression of iron (the island of nuclear stability, incapable of further\nexothermic fusion reactions) and sudden collapse in the centre of a massive star triggers\nthe explosive ejection of much of the star into space, together with a flood of neutrons.\nRemnanis of hundreds of supernovae have been found.\nMore recently, a second theory has proposed that uranium is created during the merger of\ntwo neutron stars. Neutron stars are very dense, with a teaspoon of neutron star material\nhaving a mass of the order of 5 billion tonnes. When two such bodies come close together\nthe intense gravitational forces cause them to violently merge, giving off gravitational\nwaves and producing huge amounts of heavy elements, such as gold, platinum and\nuranium.\nSo, we know that the Earth's uranium was produced through one or more of these\nprocesses, and that this material was inherited by the solar system of which the Earth is a\npart.\nWe can estimate how long ago this synthesis of uranium occurred, given:\n\nThe present day abundances of U-235 and U-238 in the various 'shells' forming our\n\nplanet.\n\nA knowledge of the half-lives of these isotopes. |\n\nhttps://world-nuclear.org/information-library/nuclear-fuel-cycle/uranium-resources/the-casmic-origins-of-uranium 3n2\n\n2113/25, 4:33 AM The Cosmic Origins of Uranium - World Nuclear Association\n\nThe age of the Earth (ca. 4.55 billion years} — known from various radiometric 'clocks',\n\nincluding those of the uranium-to-lead decay chains.\nWe can calculate the abundances of U-235 and U-238 at the time the Earth was formed.\nKnowing further that the production ratio of U-235 to U-238 in a supernova is about 1.65,\nwe can calculate that if all of the uranium now in the solar system were made in a single\nsupernova, this event must have occurred some 6.5 billion years ago.\nThis 'single stage\" is, however, an oversimplification. In fact, multiple supernovae from over\n6 billion to about 200 million years ago were involved. Additionally, studies of the isotopic\nabundances of elements, such as silicon and carbon in meteorites, have shown that more\nthan ten separate stellar sources were involved in the genesis of solar system material.\nThus the relative abundance of U-235 and U-238 at the time of formation of the solar\nsystem:\n\nCannot be inverted to a 'single stage' model age.\n\nIs essentially an accidental and unique value.\n\nReflects the input of the explosive debris of many progenitor stars.\nEnrichment in Earth's crust\nMany analyses have been made of the uranium in the rocks forming the continental and\noceanic crusts, and in samples of the Earth's mantle exposed as uplifted slices in mountain\nbelts or as 'xenoliths' in basalts and kimberlites (hosts of diamonds).\nWe can have some confidence that these measurements are robust for the crust and\nupper mantle of the Earth, but less confidence that we know the abundance of uranium in\nthe lower mantle and the outer and inner cores. While on average the abundance of\nuranium in meteorites is about 0.008 parts per million (gram/tonne), the abundance of\n\nhttps:/Wworld-nuclear. org/information library/nuclear-fuel-cycle/uranium-resourcesithe-cosmic-origins-of-uranium An2\n\n2113/25, 4:33 AM The Cosmic Origins of Uranium - World Nuclear Association\nuranium in the Earth's 'primitive mantle’ — prior to the extraction of the continental crust — is\n0.021 ppm. Allowing for the extraction of a core-forming iron-nickel alloy with no uranium\n(because of the characteristic of uranium which makes it combine more readily with\nminerals in crustal rocks rather than iron-rich ones), this still represents a roughly twofold\nenrichment in the materials forming the proto-Earth compared with average meteoritic\nmaterials.\nThe present-day abundance of uranium in the 'depleted' mantle exposed on the ocean\nfloor is about 0.004 ppm. The continental crust, on the other hand, is relatively enriched in\nuranium at some 1.4 ppm. This represents a 70-fold enrichment compared with the\nprimitive mantle. In fact, the uranium lost from the 'depleted' oceanic mantle is mostly\nsequestered in the continental crust.\nIt is likely that the process or processes which transferred uranium from the mantle to the\ncontinental crust are complex and multi-step. However, for at least the past 2 billion years\nthey have involved:\nFormation of oceanic crust and lithosphere through melting of the mantle at mid-ocean\nridges.\nMigration of this oceanic lithosphere laterally to a site of plate consumption (this is\nmarked at the surface by a deep-sea trench).\nProduction of fluids and magmas from the downgoing (subducted) lithospheric plate\nand overriding mantle 'wedge' in these subduction zones.\nTransfer of these fluids/melts to the surface in zones of ‘island arcs' (such as the\nPacific's Ring of Fire).\nProduction of continental crust from these island arc protoliths, through remelting,\ngranite formation and inira-crustal recycling.\nUranium enrichment in The Earth's crust |\nhttps://world-nuclear.org/information-library/nuclear-fuel-cycle/uranium-resources/the-casmic-origins-of-uranium 52\n\n2113/25, 4:33 AM The Cosmic Origins of Uranium - World Nuclear Association\n\"French at fOceanic'ridge att\nfisland are) | ° Transform fault at Trench at\n\nie SallooSol, (0 Sy S tM ra: Ae =a ‘ AN SS sStatiqnaryor\n\n0) ina EA Os Paci ees he: Ail Sten XS YONA Continental ONE PF\nBOE OAL RL J oii ANS ul INAS ANNES IR acre\n\nfLithosphere oy 2 ee Sy oh Rie |\nBSG 1s Waa mmm Suction: Zong) Be SUDRUCLONZONG MMB WENT gst RISING\nwae —- Yeas\n5 Soliree! added fram Eh hop ii Byte i635 $$$\nSource: adapted from Encyclopedia Britannica\nAll through this crust-forming cycle, the lithophile character of uranium is manifest in the\nconstancy of the potassium to uranium ratio at about 10,000 in the rock range from\nperidotite to granite. Because we would like to keep track of how uranium is distributed in\nthe Earth, the abundance and isotopic characteristics of lead — the radiogenic daughter of\nU-235 and U-238 — are useful parameters. Table 1 below highlights the relatively low\nabundance of lead in the Earth's mantle and the consequent high uranium to lead ratio,\ncompared with meteorites. The difference in abundance can most likely be explained by\nlead's volatile nature and tendency to combine with iron, with lead being lost during\nterrestrial accretion and core separation. One of the consequences, of course, of these high\nratios is the comparatively high radiogenic/non-radiogenic content of Pb-207/Pb-204 and\nPb-206/Pb-204 in the Earth's crust and mantle compared with meteorites or the earth's\ncore, (Pb-207 is the final stable decay product of U-235, and Pb-206 is that of U-238. Pb-\n204 is non-radiogenic.\nhttps://world-nuclear.org/information-library/nuclear-fuel-cycle/uranium-resources/the-casmic-origins-of-uranium 62\n\n2113/25, 4:33 AM The Cosmic Origins of Uranium - World Nuclear Association\nTable 1\nUabundance | Pb abundance | yo. ing\n(ppm) (ppm)\n\nMeteorites 0.008 2.470 0.003\n\nPrimitive mantle | 0.021 ois\n\nContinental crust | 1.4 12.6 O11\nThe figure given for the continental crust is an average of the entire crust. Of course, local concentration of uranium can\nfar exceed these values, ranging up to 50 ppm disseminated in some granites, to much higher values in ore deposits. In\nfact, in the geological past, local concentrations of uranium have occasionally achieved natural criticality, for example\nthe Oklo reactors in Gabon (see below}.\nEnergy source\nConvection in the outer core and the mantle, whereby heat is transferred by movement of\nheated matter, governs many of the Earth's endogenous processes.\nThe convection in the core may be driven by the heat released during progressive\nsolidification of the core (latent heat of crystallisation) and leads to the self-sustaining\nterrestrial dynamo which is the source of the Earth's magnetic field, Heat transfer from the\ncore at the core/mantle boundary is also believed to trigger upwellings of relatively hot,\nand hence low density, plumes of material. These plumes then ascend, essentially without\ngaining or losing heat, and undergo decompression melting close to the Earth's surface at\n‘hot spots' like Hawaii, Reunion and Samoa.\nHowever, the primary source of energy driving the convection in the mantle is the\nradioactive decay of uranium, thorium and potassium. In the present Earth, most of the\nenergy generated is from the decay of U-238 (ca. 10° watt/kg). At the time of the Earth's\n\nhttps://world-nuclear.org/information-library/nuclear-fuel-cycle/uranium-resources/the-casmic-origins-of-uranium m2\n\n2113/25, 4:33 AM The Cosmic Origins of Uranium - World Nuclear Association\nformation, however, decay of both U-235 and K-40 would have been about equal in\nimportance and both would have exceeded the heat production of U-238.\nA simple way of viewing the process of plate tectonics — the formation and disposal of\noceanic lithosphere — is that this is the mechanism by which the mantle sheds heat.\nConversely, 'mantle plumes/hot spots' are the way the core sheds heat. In terms of total\nheat loss from the Earth at present, plate activity constitutes about 74%, hat spots account\nfor approximately 9% and radiogenic heat lost directly from the continental crust is some\n17%. The Earth is well insulated thermally and the heat loss from the surface now can\nreflect heat generation a considerable time in the past.\nMeasurements of heat have led to estimates that the Earth is generating between 30 and\n44 terawatts of heat, much of it from radioactive decay. Measurements of antineutrinos\nhave provisionally suggested that about 24 TW arises from radioactive decay. Professor\nBob White provides the more recent figure of 17 TW from radioactive decay in the manile,\nand a more recent figure based on geoneutrinos is 20 +/- 8 TW from U-238 and Th-232\ndecay, plus 4 TW from K-40. This compares with 42-44 TW heat loss at the Earth's\nsurface from the deep Earth. The balance comes from changes in the core. Thus about half\nthe Earth’s total heat flux is from radioactive decay. (There is very much greater heat loss\narising from incident solar radiation, which is quite distinct.)\nAtmosphere and greenhouse effect, the role of plants\nApart from the fundamental physical and chemical differentiation of the Earth driven by\nplate tectonics, lithosphere formation and destruction are also critical for many processes\nin the outer layer of the atmosphere. We know, for example, that during periods of\nenhanced oceanic lithosphere formation, such as occurred during the Cretaceous period\nsome 100 million years ago, the mid-ocean ridges stood higher, triggering flooding of the\nlow-lying portions of the continents. In fact the Laurasian part of the former Pangea\nsupercontinent was drowned to a greater extent than the Gondwana part, maybe\nreflecting some deep-seated thermal/compositional contrast. The effects were many and\ninclude:\n\nhttps://world-nuclear.org/information-library/nuclear-fuel-cycle/uranium-resources/the-casmic-origins-of-uranium Bn\n\n2113/25, 4:33 AM The Cosmic Origins of Uranium - World Nuclear Association\nEnhanced carbon dioxide release causing increased carbon dioxide content of the\nocean and the atmosphere\nDiminished continental surface area leading to a reduction in the titration through\nweathering of atmospheric carbon dioxide\nSustained high atmospheric carbon dioxide levels leading to an enhanced greenhouse\neffect and warmer climate.\nSecular changes have taken place in several atmospheric processes, including a change in\ncomposition, from relatively reducing to astonishingly oxidising. The odd-looking\n\"equation\" for atmosphere production is:\nCOz + H2 =N2 + O2\nwhere the primary, volcanically degassed inputs to the atmosphere are on the left, and the\ncumulative abundant components are on the right hand side of the equation. Nitrogen is a\ntrace volcanic emission, not utilized to any great extent in surface processes — including the\ntrivial effect of organic life - and merely accumulates in the atmosphere. The Earth's\ndistance from the Sun, together with the greenhouse feedback, allows surface\ntemperatures to be generally sustained within the condensation range for water. Carbon\ndioxide dissolves in water and is also sequestered in calcite by inorganic and organic\nprecipitation as limestone.\nThe remarkable feature of our atmosphere is the presence of molecular oxygen released\nthrough photosynthesis, the process by which green plants manufacture their\ncarbohydrates from atmospheric carbon dioxide and water:\n6COz + 6H20 = CgHi20¢6 + 602\nPhotosynthesis can be traced back in time to about 3.8 billion years. For a while, the\noxygen released was consumed through oxidation of reduced ferrous compounds at the\nEarth's surface. Ultimately, the oxygen started to accumulate in the atmosphere as free\noxygen some 2.5 billion years ago.\nhttps://world-nuclear.org/information-library/nuclear-fuel-cycle/uranium-resources/the-casmic-origins-of-uranium 9n2\n\n2113/25, 4:33 AM The Cosmic Origins of Uranium - World Nuclear Association\nIn addition to many other effects, the change in the redox character of the exosphere led to\na fundamental change in the way uranium was transported in the weathering-erosion-\ndeposition cycle. Whereas under reduced conditions uranium is relatively insoluble and\nstable as uraninite (UO2), under oxidizing conditions it becomes soluble (US) and readily\ntransported. Since 2.5 billion years ago, ore deposits of uranium have been formed\nprimarily where reduction of uranium-bearing fluids was achieved, for example by bacteria\nor through contact with graphitic shales.\nUranium distribution through time\nThe oxidizing atmosphere also led to an increased concentration of uranium in the\noceans. As a consequence, transport in recirculating hydrothermal fluids led to relative\nenrichment in the oceanic crust too. The enhanced uranium transport from the exosphere\nto the Earth's interior — via subduction of oceanic lithosphere and the subsequent\nrehomogenization of this lithosphere into the Earth's mantle — has had a significant effect\non the present distribution of uranium in the Earth, and may account for some curious\ninconsistencies in the isotopic characteristics of the mantle. For example, whereas the\ntime-integrated Pb-208 (stable final decay product of Th-232)/Pb-206 values of mid-\nocean ridge basalts indicate mantle source values of Th/U of about 4, the measured values\nof Th/U and systematics of short-lived Th-U disequilibria indicate a ratio of about 2. It is\nlikely that since about 2.5 billion years ago injections of uranium into the mantle have been\neffective in the reduction of the thorium to uranium ratio on an (upper) mantle-wide scale.\nAn additional net effect is the selective reinjection of uranium as opposed to lead — which is\nmostly stripped out in subduction zones and returned immediately to the crust — into the\nmantle. We know that overall, most basalts are being produced from a mantle with an\nenhanced uranium/lead ratio and with apparent 'future' ages, compared with the lead\nisotopic ratios characteristic of a closed system, single stage evolution of uranium/lead in\nthe Earth. This feature is sometimes referred to by geochemists as the ‘lead paradox’, and\nmay in part relate to the feedback influence of an oxidising, life-triggered exosphere on the |\ninterior of the Earth.\n\nhttps://world-nuclear.org/information-library/nuclear-fuel-cycle/uranium-resources/the-cosmic-origins-of-uranium 10/12\n\n2113/25, 4:33 AM The Cosmic Origins of Uranium - World Nuclear Association\nNatural nuclear reactors in the Earth's crust\nAt Oklo in Gabon, West Africa, about 2 billion years ago, at least 17 natural nuclear\nreactors commenced operation in a rich deposit of uranium ore. Each operated at about 20\nkW thermal. At that time the concentration of U-235 in all natural uranium was 3.7 percent\ninstead of 0.7 percent as at present (U-235 decays much faster than U-238, whose half-\nlife is about the same as the age of this planet).\nThese natural chain reactions, started spontaneously by the presence of water acting as a\nmoderator, continued for about two million years before finally dying away. During this\nlong reaction period about 5.4 tonnes of fission products as well as 1.5 tonnes of\nplutonium together with other transuranic elements were generated in the orebody. The\ninitial radioactive products have long since decayed into stable elements but study of the\namount and location of these has shown that there was little movement of radioactive\nwastes during and after the nuclear reactions. Plutonium and the other transuranics\nremained immobile.\nGeoreactor theory\nA quite different view of the role of uranium in the Earth is the theory that much of the\nuranium in the primordial planet sunk to the core and has formed a core there, some 8 km\nacross, which has been fissioning ever since. The depletion of U-235 over geological time\nhas not terminated the reaction because this core is a fast reactor (not requiring any\nmoderator) which breeds plutonium-239 from the U-238. The georeactor theory rests on\nrelatively little evidence, and is not widely supported.\nhttps://world-nuclear.org/information-library/nuclear-fuel-cycle/uranium-resources/the-cosmic-origins-of-uranium 11412\n\n2113/25, 4:33 AM The Cosmic Origins of Uranium - World Nuclear Association\nNotes & references\nThis page has been adapted from a paper presented by Professor Richard Arculus at the\nUranium Institute Mid-Term Meeting in Adelaide on 17 April 1996.
